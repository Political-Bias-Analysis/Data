            "article_content": "The Journal of the American Medical Association ties pill poppers to Trump supporters. Not so fast, one prominent doctor says. The Journal of the American Medical Association published a study attempting to tie Trump supporters to drug addicts, but the famed doctor called it \u201cmisleading\u201d and said that headlines aside, it \u201coffers no proof of a connection.\" The peer-reviewed journal, also known as JAMA, indicated that it wanted to explore\u00a0the overlap between Trump voters and opioid use. The result is a \u201ccross-sectional analysis of a national sample of Medicare claims data\u201d that points to \u201cchronic use of prescription opioid drugs\u201d coinciding with people who supported President Trump's 2016 White House run. \u201cIndividual and county-level socioeconomic measures explained much of the association between the presidential vote and opioid use,\u201d the study concluded. Some left-leaning publications were quick to pick up the study, resulting in\u00a0headlines like this one in\u00a0Newsweek: \u201cTrump supporters linked to counties with higher opioid usage, a new study says.\u201d NPR\u00a0wrote, \u201cAnalysis finds geographic overlap in opioid use and Trump support in 2016,\u201d while the\u00a0ultraliberal Mother Jones\u00a0went with \"New research finds a link between Trump voters and opioid use.\"\u00a0 And New York magazine\u00a0pointed out\u00a0that \u201cplaces with high opioid use favored Trump.\u201d The news\u00a0was even picked up\u00a0overseas;\u00a0the Independent wrote, \u201cTrump election support highest in areas with highest rates of opioid painkiller use, study reveals.\u201d Despite headlines to the contrary, New York University Langone Medical Center professor and Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel doesn\u2019t agree that there's proof of a connection between avid opioid users and Trump voters. \"There is no evidence whatsoever that these factors caused voters to go for Trump.\u201d \u201cFor one thing, the opioid users are from 2015, and only Medicare patients,\u201d Siegel told Fox News. \u201cFor another thing, the voting shift in counties that didn\u2019t vote for [Mitt] Romney and now voted for Trump, even if these voters tended to be in poorer health and have a higher incidence of substance abuse ... there is no evidence whatsoever that these factors caused voters to go for Trump.\u201d Siegel explained that \u201cone possible explanation\u201d that has nothing to do with opioids may lie with the \u201cunhappiness of unhealthy or socioeconomically challenged patients\u201d in a bad economy -- who simply \u201cwanted a change\u201d and voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton. \u201cThese Trump supporters studied tended to come from counties where residents were more likely to suffer from poor health and lack of upward mobility, where even if health and economic status were good, there was a lack of community, making opioid use more likely. And then their feeling of being stuck in life would possibly have made them more likely to vote for the change candidate.\" \u201cThe issue was far more one of populist anger leading to a voting trend rather than opioid use, per se.\" The doctor and author said he felt that the study \u201cconcludes that the association between opioid use and voting patterns is at least partly explainable but socioeconomic, environmental, legal and cultural factors,\u201d but offers \u201cabsolutely no reason whatsoever to connect this with voting for Trump.\u201d Siegel said \u201cthe issue was far more one of populist anger leading to a voting trend rather than opioid use, per se.\u201d And he took issue with the study's failure to examine prescriber behavior or why opioid users\u2019 individual traits might have pushed them toward the GOP. \u201cMisleading at best, and certainly offers no proof of a connection,\u201d Siegel concluded.",

            "article_content": "Senate candidate John James discusses Michigan race. There is an undercurrent in Michigan of voters who are sick and tired of being sick and tired, and I\u2019m seeing it as I travel the state campaigning as the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in the Nov. 6 midterm election. Yes, Donald Trump carried Michigan in the presidential election two years ago, but Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the state\u2019s Democratic primary. Neither candidate was victorious because he was Republican or Democrat. Instead, each won because he was not a traditional Republican or Democrat. For years, Republicans blamed Democrats and Democrats blamed Republicans as Michigan\u2019s once-thriving cities became relics of a bygone era. The truth is, both parties are to blame. Neighborhoods close to where I grew up and where I now work in Detroit have been gutted, yet the career politicians continue to be re-elected. I'm running for the Senate to change that. Detroit used to be the mobility capital of the world, not just for automobiles but for socio-economic upward mobility as well. Take it from my father, John A. James, who like many others came to Detroit in search of economic opportunity. John James and his father. (Courtesy of John James) My dad was born in 1941 in Starkville, Mississippi. He grew up across the street from Mississippi State University, which he couldn\u2019t attend because he is black. But he refused to accept victimhood and dependency as his destiny. Instead, he worked his entire life to build a better future for himself and his family. It was my father\u2019s example that most inspired me to a life of service. After attending West Point, I served as an Apache helicopter pilot with over 750 hours of combat during Operation Iraqi Freedom. While I was in Iraq, the Great Recession took hold back home, and I saw images from Detroit, Flint and Saginaw that looked worse than the combat zones I was flying in. I was fighting for Iraqi freedom and opportunity, but I didn\u2019t see enough people back home fighting for Michiganders. I told myself that one day I would return home to Detroit \u2013 the city known as the Arsenal of Democracy during World War II \u2013 and to my family\u2019s business John James, seen here in a helicopter while serving in Iraq. (Courtesy of John James) Detroit, the birthplace of the American middle class, is now on the cusp of a great American renaissance. Unfortunately, not everyone is being included. Large swaths of the city and surrounding areas are being left out. Talent retention and capital investment are on the rise, but we must protect the chance to achieve the American dream for all Michiganders. If we do this, Detroit can be the mobility capital of the world once again. Most importantly, we must focus on keeping families together and healthy. My opponent, Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, promised to turn around every failing school when she was elected to federal office in 2000. Yet today, Detroit public schools remain the worst in the nation. We can and should address failing schools and how they have contributed to our labor crisis. Record-low unemployment rates are great, but they gloss over the fact that there are a record number of job openings going unfilled because of a skills gap in growing industries. Jobs are a part of the equation, but they are not a solution on their own. We must focus on early childhood development, K-12 education, trade and vocational schooling, workforce development, criminal justice reform, and rolling back regulations and taxes that stifle entrepreneurship, innovation and job creation. Stabenow promised to take on the high price of prescription drugs in 2002. But today prescription drug costs are continuing to skyrocket, and the opioid epidemic is hitting not just our urban areas, but our rural and suburban communities as well. Stabenow talks about improving our infrastructure. Yet PFAS \u2013 man-made chemicals \u2013 are being discovered in communities across the state, our Soo Locks are decaying, our roads are crumbling, the drinking water is contaminated, and Detroit remains the second-most dangerous city in America, with violent crime increasing. Despite all of these persisting problems, the urban community is told to vote for Democrats. Why? After 18 years in the United States Senate, Stabenow has done nothing for Michigan to earn another six. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 tremendous strides have been made under pro-business Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and pro-business Democratic Mayor Mike Duggan in Detroit. We are seeing the irreplaceable benefits that economic development brings, but even these two leaders would agree that we have a long way to go. Michigan voters will have the opportunity to accelerate our state\u2019s progress on Nov. 6. Finally, we will have the chance to have one U.S. senator from each party representing our state, which would give Michigan a much-needed voice in Washington regardless of who is in the White House or which party is in the majority. This will put Michigan in a much stronger position to win support for critical federal funding and projects. For far too long, partisan rhetoric and willful ignorance have dominated the political landscape in America. The pundits get their ratings and the career politicians get re-elected, while the rest of us get ineffectual leaders and unfulfilled promises. I am running to say \"no more.\" You see, some in power are not as interested in solving poverty as they are in making it comfortable. We can do better. The fact of the matter is, we have only ourselves \u2013 the voters \u2013 to blame. We\u2019ve allowed the political discourse to devolve into little more than red vs. blue, black vs. white, my team vs. your team. Nothing highlights the absurdity of the discourse today more than the attacks against me for being a black man and a Republican. Faith and family, God and country, and service before self \u2013 these aren\u2019t Republican values, they\u2019re American values. The powers-that-be have pitted the people against one another with identity politics and the suppression of free speech. There was a time when people were entitled to their own opinion, but not to their own facts. Today, the reverse seems true \u2013 people feel entitled to their own facts, but not to their own opinion. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have made the sorts of promises that Stabenow has made, and like her, have failed to follow through. All my life, from the battlefield to the boardroom, I have demonstrated the ability to achieve results for people of all backgrounds, and I am prepared to serve all Michiganders in the U.S. Senate. I\u2019m living the American dream and I want to protect that dream for future generations.",

            "article_content": "President Trump during a roundtable on immigration policy at Morrelly Homeland Security Center, May 23, 2018, in Bethpage, N.Y. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Trump often takes to Twitter to announce public policy, changes to his Cabinet or bloviate on socio-economic issues. However, there are a number of times when the president misspells words on Twitter, which leads to huge spikes in searches for these misspellings and can often cause confusion. \"When we examined search data for misspelled words, comparing it to the dates of many of the president\u2019s spelling gaffes, a pattern emerged,\" according to a Dictionary.com article, which highlights the president's abundant mistakes. \"Each misspelling sparks a surge in searches on site, specifically searches for that exact configuration of letters, as Americans attempt to spellcheck both the president and themselves.\" The first example cited is a tweet from Trump the day after his presidential inauguration in January 2017. TRUMP CAN'T BLOCK TWITTER USERS OVER THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS, NY FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS \u201cI am honered to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States,\" Trump wrote. The tweet was quickly deleted and corrected with the right spelling, but the misspelling led to a 3,850 percent surge in searchers for \"honered\" compared to the previous week. The site noted that searches for \"honer\" also had a modest jump, at 1,271 percent. Dictionary.com also mentioned Trump's March 2017 attack on the Obama administration for tapping his phones, a claim that was later refuted by the Department of Justice. There were reports that the FBI tapped the phones of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, which some have said vindicated Trump's claim. Trump's misspelling of the word \"tap\" led to a 46,300 percent increase in searches for \"tapp\" over the prior week. Perhaps the most famous of Trump's Twitter gaffes is his tweet nearly a year ago mentioning \"covfefe.\" \"Despite the constant negative press covfefe,\" Trump wrote on May 31, 2017 in a now-deleted tweet. It has never been cleared up what Trump was trying to say (did he mean coverage? attention?), \"covfefe\" become a word on Dictionary.com's list that defined 2017. TWITTER IS GOING TO HIDE TROLL TWEETS (In the recent \"Yanny\" or \"Laurel\" debate, Trump poked fun at himself, saying he heard \"covfefe.\") Trump's grammatical gaffes on Twitter are not just limited to misspellings \u2013 he has homophone errors as well. On May 8, 2017, Trump tweeted: \"Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council.\" The tweet was later deleted and replaced with the correct \"counsel,\" but not before a 78 percent increase in searches for the word \"council.\" Trump also made a mistake when he tweeted on Aug. 17, 2017 \"Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heel, & we will heel, & be stronger than ever before!\" The tweet was later replaced with another which had the correct spelling of \"heal,\" but not before searches for heel (the back part of someone's foot or a command used to tell a dog to stay) shot up 761 percent. Trump's nicknames for people (calling Kim Jong-Un \"Little Rocket Man\" or \"Cryin' Chuck Schumer\") have also had a tendency to be misspelled. FAKE NEWS SPREADS FASTER ON TWITTER THAN REAL NEWS, STUDY SAYS In an apparent crack at Sen. Bob Corker (R.-TN.), Trump tweeted: \"...the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us. People like liddle' Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back. Now we move forward!\" Not only is \"little\" misspelled, but it also has an apostrophe that is inappropriate for its usage. (Trump used an errant apostrophe earlier this week when he wrote: \"The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they\u2019re looking at the rest of the World. Oh\u2019 great!) Searches for \"liddle,\" which is not a word in the English language, spiked 4,900 percent. Earlier this week, The Boston Globe, citing two people familiar with the process, reported that some of Trump's tweets are written by staff and include grammatical errors on purpose to make it seem as if the president himself is writing them. One of the people said that while those who tweet for the president do use poor grammar on purpose, they do not misspell people's names or words. \u201cTweets that are proposed are in his voice,\u201d said one of the people. \u201cYou want to do it in a way that fits his style.\u201d Follow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter\u00a0@Chris_Ciaccia",

The Yale Law professor accused of saying Judge Brett Kavanaugh only had law clerks who \"looked like models\" blasted the claim, saying the Supreme Court nominee's only \"litmus test\" when hiring is \"excellence.\" The Guardian\u00a0reported Thursday that Yale Law Professor Amy Chua advised students that it was \"no accident\" that Kavanaugh\u2019s female clerks all \u201clooked like models,\u201d and reportedly provided fashion advice to female students preparing to interview with him. The article also cited former students who claimed that Chua\u2019s husband, Yale Law Professor Jed Rubenfeld, also told students that Kavanaugh liked a certain \u201clook.\u201d Chua denied the claims, noting that Kavanaugh\u2019s only \u201clitmus test\u201d when hiring has been \u201cexcellence.\u201d \u201cHe hires only the most qualified clerks, and they have been diverse as well as exceptionally talented and capable,\u201d Chua said in a statement. \u201cThere is good reason so many of them have gone on to Supreme Court clerkships; he only hires those who are extraordinarily qualified.\u201d Yale Law Professor Amy Chua, left, and husband, Yale Law Professor Jed Rubenfeld, right, have a daughter who clerks for Judge Brett Kavanaugh. (NBC Universal) Of the 48 clerks who worked for Kavanaugh over 12 years on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 25 were women. In July, Chua penned an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, endorsing Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the high court and praising him for being a \u201cmentor to women.\u201d \u201cAs I wrote in the Wall Street Journal, he has also been an exceptional mentor to his female clerks and a champion of their careers,\u201d Chua said in a statement. \u201cAmong my proudest moments as a parent was the day I learned our daughter would join those ranks.\u201d Chua\u2019s daughter is a clerk in Kavanaugh\u2019s chambers. A former Kavanaugh clerk from 2007 to 2008, Porter Wilkinson, also blasted the claims, calling them \"offensive.\" \u201cJudge Kavanuagh hires law clerks based solely on their intellect and qualifications,\" Wilkinson said in a statement to Fox News. \u201cThe only thing all of us have in common is that we worked hard and proved ourselves able to meet his rigorous substantive standards. Otherwise, the 48 of us are diverse by gender, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, geography, political persuasion, religion, education, socioeconomic background, and so much more.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is offensive and demeaning for anyone to suggest that Judge Kavanaugh hired law clerks based on anything other than merit.\u201d Kavanaugh is currently facing intense scrutiny after allegations surfaced last week that he had sexually assaulted a woman while in high school in the 1980s. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who made the accusations, claimed that at a party 36 years ago, Kavanaugh pinned her down, tried to remove her bathing suit and put his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream. Ford\u2019s attorney, Debra Katz, said her client considered this to be \u201can attempted rape.\u201d Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the allegations and has offered to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, again, under oath. Through her attorneys this week, Ford demanded that the FBI launch an investigation into the allegations prior to her appearance. On Thursday afternoon, Ford's attorneys said she would be willing to testify should the committee be able to guarantee her safety. \u201cThis is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes\u2014to her or anyone,\u201d Kavanaugh said in a statement Monday. \u201cBecause this never happened, I had no idea who was making the accusation until she identified herself [Sunday.]\u201d Ford\u2019s identity was first revealed in a Washington Post article on Sunday. Her accusations first surfaced after Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., obtained her letter detailing the alleged incident. More than five dozen women who knew Kavanaugh while in high school wrote a letter in his defense, calling him a \u201cgood person.\u201d",

John McCain\u2019s death from glioblastoma on Saturday at age 81 brought new attention to a disease that affects nearly 700,000 Americans. Officials at the National Brain Tumor Society, based in Newton, Mass., said in a written statement that they were \"profoundly saddened\" by McCain's death, and called for a nationwide effort to combat the disease. Glioblastoma\u00a0has been described as an \u201caggressive\u201d form of brain cancer that usually occurs in adults. McCain, an Arizona Republican who served in the Senate for more than 30 years, was diagnosed with the disease in July 2017 and succumbed to it 13 months later. The same type of cancer had previously taken the lives of Beau Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, in 2015, and U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,\u00a0in 2009. More than 12,000 new cases of the disease are diagnosed each year in the U.S., according to the American Brain Tumor Association. \u201cGlioblastoma is one of the most complex, drug-resistant, and adaptive cancers there is,\u201d said David Arons, CEO of the National Brain Tumor Society. According to the group, glioblastoma can afflict men, women and children \"of any race, socioeconomic background or party affiliation.\" The statement concludes with a call to action to find \u201cmore effective treatments and ultimately a cure.\u201d \u201cAs Senator McCain often implored during his campaign for president, we as a country are stronger when we dedicate ourselves to causes greater than [our] own self-interest. \u201cLet this be the moment in our history that we decide to collectively take on glioblastoma and brain tumors with the same earnest [resolve] with which we dedicate to our other national ills.\u201d Fox News' Paulina Dedaj contributed to this story.",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRIAN KILMEADE, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS: Hi. Welcome to \"Watters' World.\" I'm Brian Kilmeade. I am lucky enough to be filling in for Jesse tonight. The President adding Rudy Giuliani to his legal team, I don't know if you heard, and they saw a lot of him this week, and here's why. The bombastic former Mayor came out swinging big time, saying, that special prosecutor Robert Mueller's probe is really a trap. And Rudy is not a sucker who will fall for it, either is the president. It all comes after questions Mueller wants to ask Trump, you know, those questions he wanted to ask the president, well, they were leaked to the New York Times this week, we still don't know why. And we've learned, he's considering the possibility is Mueller, of a Presidential subpoena. Here is the president yesterday. (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would love to. Nobody wants to me to speak more than me. In fact, against my lawyers because most lawyers say, never speak on anything. I would love to speak because we have done nothing wrong. There was no collusion with the Russians. There was nothing. There was no obstruction. I have to find that we're going to be treated fairly because everybody sees it now and it is a pure witch hunt. KILMEADE: Wow. And stunning comments from a Federal judge. Get this, this happened Friday. He openly questioned the Mueller probe. During a hearing for Paul Manafort, Judge T.S. Ellis said this, he scolded team Mueller portraying them as liars, saying they are not really interested in Manafort's potential bank fraud and everything else, but really into ousting President Trump. Here to help us break this down and the significance of that statement in court is former Assistant US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, also he writes for the National Review with his very penetrating columns, Andrew McCarthy. Andrew, welcome back. What is your reaction to that Judge's comment - those Judge's comments on Friday? ANDREW MCCARTHY, FORMER ASSISTANT US ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Well, I'm relieved, Brian, that finally someone is able, who has the authority and status to push back at the Special Counsel investigation, someone is finally pushing back at what has been the flaw of this investigation from the beginning which is that it's an unguided missile. What's supposed to happen in this country is you have a crime and then you assign a prosecutor. What happened here was they assigned a prosecutor and then gave him basically limitless authority to go find a crime. And that's really not supposed to happen in this country. So, for the first time, we've had someone who the Special Counsel has to take notice of, the judge presiding over a case who is saying, \"What on earth does this have to do with collusion with Russia?\" And he was not very satisfied obviously with the answers he got from the Special Counsel. KILMEADE: I mean, is the goal to take down Paul Manafort, a man who was in Eastern Europe for the last 20 years, who came back for a few weeks to help out President Trump, and then the President said, \"Okay, you're not really working out. You're not my type of guy. You're out.\" Now, he's look at an 18-count indictment and this is what a lot of people have been saying all along. Now, what I also thought was significant is the judge said, \"Can you show me the scope of your mandate, please?\" They handled it to him redacted. How dare they hand a US District Judge a redacted agreement about what you can and can't do. That doesn't make any sense, does it? MCCARTHY: Well, what they are saying, Brian, is what's in the document is classified information, or at least some of it is. And if it's not classified, it's highly sensitive. Their position is, they gave the judge what they think is relevant to the Manafort investigation because you know, look, just because you're a federal judge doesn't mean you get to stick your nose into anything you want to stick your nose in. However, I think the judge quite rightly said that he would be the judge in this instance of what he was - what is relevant for him to look and what it is not because they are saying that that document is what cabins their investigation, and he is entitled to know that. KILMEADE: Yes, I would think so, plus, it's good to see somebody outside a news channel say what many people like you have speculated, that you spent in the legal profession, there is something wrong here, and I brought this up with you earlier this week on radio, and that is they hired another prosecutor - another prosecutor, and this guy also gave to Hillary Clinton. So, Mueller has to know that that is one of the hits on him. You are a Republican perhaps, but look who you are hiring, and he adds another. Should he be adding another prosecutor at this point? MCCARTHY: Well, first of all, I think it's ridiculously overstaffed to begin with to have 18 lawyers. I think you and I discussed earlier this week, that you know, I ran a big terrorism case back in the mid '90s with three prosecutors, you know, it was pretty big deal at the time. So, why you would need 18 prosecutors, I don't know. But I do think that Special Counsel Mueller has disserved himself by the tenure he has had with respect to the people who he has brought aboard. And I know people say, you know, look, they are not allowed to inquire when you are hiring government people about what their political attitudes are. These are not people who applied for a job with Mueller. These are people he went out and recruited. KILMEADE: I know. MCCARTHY: A case like this that's freighted with politics, you have to be aware of whether you are retaining people who are not only opposed to the president, some of them seem like they are quite hostile to the president. KILMEADE: You know, the president of course, late this week came out and said, Rudy Giuliani, he is the perfect person, but maybe, we're going to work with him to make sure he gets the facts straight - meaning the case in the Southern District of New York regarding around Michael Cohen, but I want to get this, and do weigh in this. Here is what everyone is saying about whether or not the president should sit down Robert Mueller, and even if it means a subpoena if he doesn't. Let's watch. (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I were the president's lawyer, I would probably tell him not to sit down with the Special Counsel. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whether or not the president ought to submit to an interview to Bob Mueller and FBI agents, and my argument is never, never, never in caps should he do that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He, of course, should not testify unless he absolutely has to. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) KILMEADE: You know, Nixon wasn't asked to. Clinton avoided the subpoena, but Robert Mueller already indicated to Rudy Giuliani, I am going to hit you with a subpoena if you don't do this willingly. So, what do you do, Andrew? MCCARTHY: Well, I think you assert executive privilege. I would point out that while Mueller hasn't seem to find collusion with Russia, he has seem to make a small cottage industry of making false statements cases against people who voluntarily agree to be interviewed by the FBI. So, I'd be very wary about going in there, but I really don't think, Brian, that Mueller should be allowed to ask the president for an interview until he can satisfy a test that establishes that he has got a serious crime that Trump is somehow complicit in it and that Trump is the repository of information that he can't get from the any other source. If you can't meet that simple test, you should not, as a prosecutor get to have a conversation with the president of the United States. We don't allow the president to be subpoenaed because something thinks it would be interesting. KILMEADE: You ask Rosenstein that and he should decide that, but he's anything but predictable. Andrew McCarthy, your opinions and insight are invaluable because you don't have a horse in this race. You're calling balls and strikes. Thanks so much. MCCARTHY: Thanks, Brian. KILMEADE: All right, another huge story coming this week, and it's coming up beginning on Tuesday. Finding a new CIA Director. With all the corruption that has been uncovered on the FBI side with the Russian probe and other things, isn't it time to take politics out of our intel agencies? And isn't that what President Trump is trying to do? So, why is anyone opposing a lifelong participant in the CIA? In the agency itself? I am talking about Gina Haspel. She should be equally applauded on the left and the right. Joining us now to discuss it this is Dr. Jim Mitchell. He is one of the people behind the Enhanced Interrogation Program that played such a valuable role - a significant role in keeping us safe and stopping follow- up attacks, in my opinion. So, Gina Haspel, many people are questioning, Dr. Mitchell, always good to see you, on whether or not her role in black sites rendition and enhanced interrogation should be something that expels her from getting this job. What do you think? JAMES MITCHELL, AUTHOR, \"ENHANCED INTERROGATION\": I think she should have an opportunity to explain her role. I don't think that people should presume that she did one thing or the other. I am not in a position to be able to talk specifically about her role was, but she should have to answer hard questions, if that's the case, but I'm confident that if she is given a fair hearing, that she'll be able to answer them in a way that puts people at ease. What I can say because I know her is that, you know, she adheres strictly to the rule of law. She is in no way likely to become some sort of a rogue director, that does some of the things we have seen other agencies like the FBI did recently KILMEADE: So, when you talk about these things, she has got - tactically, she decides how she wants to answer. She could, say, \"Yes, everything I did was okay by justice. I did what I had to do by law to keep America safe. And now, you don't want to do that, and I won't do that.\" So, should she say that or just, \"I had nothing to do with rendition. I had nothing to do with enhanced interrogation. I had nothing to do with black sites.\" Which one would you do? MITCHELL: I think she should be as open and honest as she can be given the current level of secrecy about what she did or she didn't do. You know, there is nothing to be ashamed of about that program. It was established at the highest levels of government. It was judged legal by the Justice Department. It was approved by the President of the United States and the National Security Council. It was briefed to both Houses of Congress, some of whom said, \"Is that all you are going do?\" And it was adhered to legally and lawfully, so I don't think there's anything to be ashamed of whatever her role was, which I'll leave to them to explain. KILMEADE: All right, the CIA released a memo. They want her. They said that they have absolved her from any inappropriate behavior regarding the videotape that was destroyed that showed, I believe Khalid Sheikh Mohammed being water-boarded or whatever else was there. So, they have absolved her of that. Senator Burris says, they have provided all the - he's a Republican - they have provided all the documents necessary. He says, the documents they are asking for don't exist. MITCHELL: Well, I am not sure what documents they are asking for. If they are asking for those tapes, I think it's been clearly established that those tapes were destroyed, and they were destroyed lawfully otherwise, Jose Rodriguez who destroyed those tapes, he's been really clear about that. He authorized the destruction of those tapes on his authority, and it was his decision alone. He ordered the person who was there to get rid of those. The only role that Gina had in that whole thing was as his chief of staff, he directed her to put together the cable telling them to do that, but it was done under his authority and released under his signature. KILMEADE: So, I mean just to take a look at who Gina Haspel is, career intelligence officer, Deputy Director since February 2017, overseas experienced, multiple assignments as a Station Chief and will be the first woman to lead the CIA, how valuable, finally, Dr. Mitchell is it - no political appointee. This is somebody appointed by a politician, but is not a politician. The agency would revel in having somebody from the agency leading them, wouldn't they? MITCHELL: Well, the best and the brightest minds in the intelligence community said she is one of the most qualified individual to ever be nominated for a position like that, and she has been described as the first person - the first woman in 70 years who has worked herself up through the ranks, seven overseas assignments; with her assignment as Deputy Director of the CIA, four senior level positions. She is apolitical and her focus will be on getting the CIA to do what it is that the CIA is supposed to do, not build a bureaucracy in Washington, but focus on intelligence and espionage. And I think we need that. America will be safer for having her. KILMEADE: You think - I know. Dr. Mitchell, thanks for what you've done. Thanks so much for your time. MITCHELL: Thank you, sir. KILMEADE: All right, Rand Paul stands in the way and perhaps John McCain, will give a thumbs up or a thumbs down. They will need every vote because Mike Pompeo got under 60 to be secretary of state, and he should have gotten about 80. Meanwhile, President Trump trying to break through this week's media side shows and tout his true accomplishments, tweeting this. \"There was no collusion. It is a hoax and there was no obstruction of justice. That is a setup and trap. What there is, is a negotiation going on with North Korea over nuclear war, negotiations going on with China over trade deficits, negotiations on NAFTA and much, much more. Witch hunt. Exclamation point. Well, those negotiations with North Korea may win him a Nobel Peace prize in 2019, eighteen congressmen and women officially nominating him this week. And of course, Obama received the peace prize in 2009 as president of the United States, his vision of a world - vision of a world without nuclear weapons got him that. He may have had a vision, but Trump seems to be executing a plan. Trump's tough talk though, bringing North Korea and South Korea together in a historic meeting last week, and Kim Jong-un may soon release its three American hostages; with all that winning, \"Watters' World\" hit the streets to see what the average person thinks about what we should do on North Korea (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) JESSE WATTERS, HOST, \"WATTERS WORLD\": What should we do about Kim Jong Un? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The dictator of North Korea? WATTERS: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know. It's a complicated question. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would give him a decent haircut. He also needs to like lose the white shirt without a tie, well done, Jesse. WATTERS: How would you deal with Kim Jong-un. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I wouldn't deal with him to be honest... UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't need my father. I am strong. WATTERS: What should we do about Kim Jong-un. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We should take kind people like yourself, sir and like myself and everyone and just give him a hug. WATTERS: If we hug the dictator, he's going to kill us though. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you guys buy me a flight to North Korea, I will be the first one happy to give him a hug. WATTERS: How do you think the President is handling the North Korean crisis? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible). WATTERS: Do you think Trump is doing a good job of taking care of North Korea? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is he taking care of it? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Trump promised us he was going take care of us. America first. Let's just take care of things here. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know he's crazy, I have no idea what he's doing. WATTERS; So, you are wearing that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How should Trump deal with Kim Jong-un? Carefully. WATTERS: Are you careful with your hair? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just grows out of my head like this, man. All natural. WATTERS: Why is there a North and South Korea to begin with? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why was there an East and West Germany? I don't know. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why is there a Southern and Northern California? WATTERS: Well, there is north and south. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I mean, there is north and there is south. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because they have like - they disagree on things, like they are divided because of like different intentions. Like, it's been like a whole like - they've been like divided for a really, really long time. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These lines are things that separate us. Less lines, more hugs, more love. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Happy. Happy. Ha-ha-ha. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can I give you a hug? WATTERS: Yes. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) KILMEADE: All right, that was great. I am more worried about New York City than ever before, but up next on this show, the Trump-Kanye revolution coming to a screen near you in a country that you might be in right now. KANYE WEST, AMERICAN RAPPER: I just love trump. That's my boy. Like, you know, it's like so many rappers, you look at a video of Snoop Dogg loving Trump, but then he gets into office, and they don't him like - Trump is one of raps favorite people. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Kanye West must have some power because you probably saw, I doubled my African-American poll numbers. We went from 11 to 22 in one week. Thank you, Kanye. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) KILMEADE: Kanye West-Donald Trump revolution continues. West professing his love for President Trump as you just heard on TMZ, hitting President Obama for failing Chicago and saying this about slavery. (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) WEST: You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice. Like he was there for 400 years and this is all we are. You know, like, it's like, we are mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. So, prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being in one race, that we're the human race. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) KILMEADE: So, it set the internet on fire this week, but it won't be the last we'll hear from Kanye. Get this, the President reportedly agreeing to host a White House summit on race with him and other athletes, as well as some artists and maybe some others in between. Joining us right now, Fox news political analyst Gianno Caldwell and political commentator extraordinaire Wendy Osefo. What a week it's been for race, a bit of a surprise that Kanye West is leading it. Wendy, for you, what do you get out of this dialogue, and would you like to see it continue at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? WENDY OSEFO, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think that that the dialogue that Kanye West is perpetuating is very, very dangerous. And we have to underscore that. For him to stay here and say slavery was a choice is one that just negates all of history and all of the evidence of history. Slavery was not a choice, and if he's talking about mental slavery, then there are individuals if you look at history like Nat Turner, like Harriet Tubman who rebelled against slavery. So, he has no foundational basis for this argument. Furthermore, if we are going to have a summit about race at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that will be a great thing. but for the life of me, I do not understand why every time we come to issues affecting black and brown people, we bring together athletes, we bring together artists. Why is it that we do not bring together scholars who are known in this field, whether it's Dr. Michael Eric Dyson, Dr. Greg Carr, Dr. Imani Perry, Dr. Marc Lamont Hill. They are individuals who have studied race, who have studied politics. We are not minstrel shows and we should not be represented by individuals who are not versed in this space. KILMEADE: Great point, and if it's athletes and artists, it's a virtual waste of time. Gianno, first off, your reaction to the reaction to Kanye's comments. GIANNO CALDWELL, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, of course, I agree with Wendy, slavery was not a choice. And I can also speak to the individuals who did make choices to free themselves, we are talking about the 250 rebellions that took place including Nat Turner, including Harriet Tubman, who led - freed over a thousand slaves, and those that freed themselves from many plantations across the country, so I get that. What I can say in terms of this imprisonment that Kanye talked about in terms of mentally, there are a lot of people who are mentally imprisoned. We live in a blaming generation right now where people are quick to blame history as to why they are not succeeding. And I think that's problematic on many levels. I think, at the end of the day, we do live in a country where we can create our own opportunities to do well, now, that doesn't excuse any systems of institutional racism that seems to hold us back, I get that, but that's not going to prevent people like D. Wendy Osefo from succeeding, who is an immigrant, who works as a professor at one of the leading institutions, who sits on Fox News Channel, on air, the number one cable news channel in the country almost every night or myself who was born into poverty, whose mom was addicted to crack cocaine. But yet, and still, here I am having this conversation with you two, very distinguished individuals. So, I think that at the end of the day, that we take this into our own hands, and that's again, no one can stop you but yourself. KILMEADE: Wendy, I think, Gianno, you put a strong argument using both your backgrounds is, \"Hey, we're not saying that the playing field was equal. We're not saying that we are proud of what happened 150 years ago, but having said that, this is the playing field and let's be successful. Don't use it as an excuse. How can you say that, Wendy, and not be racially insensitive? OSEFO: Well, you can say that by also knowing the policies that make us feel that there are hurdles, that even though we are 150 years removed from slavery, there are still issues that plague people in communities, communities of color and communities that have low socioeconomic backgrounds. I quote the great, Dr. Martin Luther King that says, \"We have the notion in our country that individuals will pull themselves up from their boot straps, but these individual do not have any boots.\" So, we have to make sure that we are looking at things in context, and not saying, everyone should rise to the playing field, but we have policies that make us feel certain people are not able to, and that's really important. KILMEADE: All right, excellent, so let me - first off, what do you think Gianno, for a feud -- should this be televised? CALDWELL: I think elements of it should be televised. I've reached out to Pastor Gerald Scott, I actually had a conversation with him a couple of days ago, talking about the summit and my involvement with it personally. This is something that I have been calling for, for a long time. Wendy and I had said on television when we talked about Charlottesville and had that very emotional segment, where we called for a summit on race. I think this is something that is needed to be done a very long time ago, but now, there's voices that are coming to the table. And Wendy had a good point, you need to bring all voices to the table, whether we agree or not because at this point, we spend a lot of time talking past each other versus talking with each other, and although people don't like the President, and some rightfully so, they may not like what he says or does and we get that, but at this particular point in our country, we really need to have a serious conversation on race and how can we move together and work together, and I think that's why the Kanye West dynamic is so powerful. Although, I may not agree with everything he says, he has at least opened up a conversation where people, especially in the celebrity caliber aren't just shooting him down, they are saying, \"Okay, we may disagree with him, but we're listening.\" KILMEADE: Wendy, and finally, just who do you want to make sure is there. I want you there, Gianno, I want you there. Wendy, who do you want to bring with you? OLEFO: I want to make sure - absolutely, myself and Gianno are going to be there. I want to bring Dr. Marc Lamont Hill to the conversation. I want to bring Dr. Greg Carr to the conversation. I want to bring Dr. Michelle Alexander to the conversation. I want to make sure that scholars about race, about policies are at the table. KILMEADE: I think that's great and it's a great idea, as long as everyone says \"I will listen and not just talk.\" If people will listen, and they could just face one of a series of conferences and keep politics out of it.  Thanks so much. Appreciate it. OLEFO: Thank you. KILMEADE: And I hope this happens. Gianno and Wendy has moved that conversation forward. Let's move ahead. Is California closer than ever to seceding from the United States of America? Can they do that? I am going to talk to the man who's leading the effort. I want to find out why he hates America. Next. BANDERAS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I am Julie Banderas. Investigators on Special Counselor Robert Mueller's team reportedly questioning California real estate investor, Tom Barrack in their Russian meddling probe. He is a close friend of President Trump, who played an integral role in the 206 campaign. No word on the specific topics covered in that interview. Lava and dangerous ash spewing outside a volcano in Hawaii two days after a volcanic eruption on Hawaii's big island. The eruption was triggered by an earthquake on Thursday followed by another bigger quake on Friday. At least five homes in the area have caught fire so far. Hawaii County has ordered evacuations for more than 1,700 people. And NASA launching a historic rocket into space found for Mars. The InSight robotic explorer will be the first to study the interior of the Red Planet. I am Julie Banderas, now back, to \"Watters' World.\" You're watching Fox News Channel. KILMEADE: California has made protecting illegal immigrants and legalizing pot its priorities, not necessarily in line with most of America, so is it time for the Golden State to secede and become their own country. The man who says yes is trying to put the Cal Exit Movement on the ballot for voters and he's trying to do it right away. He joins us right now. His name is Marcus Ruiz Evans and he is the President and co-founder of Yes, California. Marcus, why do you want to leave us? MARCUS RUIZ EVANS, PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER, YES, CALIFORNIA: We lose money and our cultures are not intact. I mean, look at the war as the California Governor calls it that the Federal government has launched on California. You never had a California Governor talk like that. And now, you have 30 lawsuits from the California government against the Federal government. Anything that Trump does, California tries to block. Now, I support that, but I also agree with what Jeff Sessions is saying. This is unsustainable. You know, you cannot have a government work this way. On top of that, California is a donor state. We have to raise taxes on ourselves to subsidize 25 to 35 American states who are already doing better than us. (CROSSTALK) KILMEADE: Right. Now, a couple of things, as you know, there are multiple counties who are siding with the Federal - in California including San Diego and parts of Orange County who are siding with the US government on the immigration policy that you guys shouldn't be in this case with sanctuary states, so not everybody is speaking like Marcus. RUIZ EVANS: Well, that's true. There are conservatives in California. I would point out that the overwhelming majority of Californians support the policies and we're going to see that in the elections coming up. I know there is a lot of talk about people in California are going to revolt and they are going to push back against this. It isn't going to happen. Let me peer into the future for you and say that our policies are going to stay the way that they are. Nobody is going to be rebuked and we are going to continue on the path that we are already on through the elections and then we'll be able to see who is right when that happens. KILMEADE: Marcus, I look at the refugees, the would-be immigrants that are sitting on the fence in San Diego kind of making a mockery of our barrier. And I think something has got to change, you want all of those people to come in, open the border, let them all come in, count them all as equal, right? RUIZ EVANS: No, we never said that. We never said that. Never said that at all. KILMEADE: So, that's the main thing. They want to bolster the immigration laws, they want to build up that border, and reinforce the wall. RUIZ EVANS: I think that the collective opinion is that America has had 30 years to deal with the immigration policy and it never did it. I see a lot of talk, but it's kind of like, it's a little bit, too little, too late. People who are undocumented, 40 percent of them are visa overstays. That's from the Federal government not doing their job. The border protection is not being there doing their job... (CROSSTALK) KILMEADE: All right, so real quick, we're up against it. I want to find out, what do you plan on doing - why do you think you're better off in your own country? Who is going to protect your shores? When you have fires ravaging the entire state, what are going to do when the Federal government is not going to be protect you and help put that out? RUIZ EVANS: Certainly, well, I always encourage people to look at natural emergencies and see how much Federal assistance we've got. I recall Governor Schwarzenegger being upset with President Bush because we couldn't get enough fire support. Additionally, the Federal budget for fire suppression support has been cut, while the amount of fires in California have gone up. So, if we look at fires and natural disasters, I encourage everybody to look at this, we are not getting what we deserve. We are not getting what we paid for. We are a donor state. We lose $30 billion to $100 billion each year, and we have to beg for fire support? I think Donald Trump recently gave us around $200 million in Federal assistance to deal with the fires. We lost $32 billion. We have to beg for $200 million when you took $32 billion? Horrible deal. KILMEADE: Marcus Ruiz Evans, he says California pays out $100 billion more than it takes in, and he wants to form his own country, it's called Cal Exit. Marcus, I would miss you, so I hope you're not successful. Talk to you soon. Meanwhile, Jesse may be off tonight, but he found me before he left for a must see quiz. How well did I do? How well do I know our Fox News colleagues? That story, next. KILMEADE: All right, before Jesse went out on assignment, I entered \"Watters' World\" for some fun and games. Watch. WATTERS: Here we go. Biggest Trump supporter on Fox News. Hannity or Lou Dobbs? KILMEADE: Wow. WATTERS: Who do you have? KILMEADE: I will put this way, you talking about on air or off air? WATTERS: Let's not make this more complicated than it already is. KILMEADE: I would say Sean Hannity, better hair. WATTERS: Better hair. You're not going to take this segment seriously. KILMEADE: I am just saying, if I look at both men, I see very accomplished men, and they have accomplished a lot in their life and they both said that President Trump is the number one President ever. WATTERS: They both said that? KILMEADE: In my life... WATTERS: Never in the history of a president... KILMEADE: Summary of their show at the end. SEAN HANNITY, HOST, \"HANNITY\": All the accomplishments of the President keeping his promise, checking off his list, ain't that perfect, nobody is perfect, but he's done a really good job... LOU DOBBS, HOST, \"LOU DOBBSTONIGHT\": We'll he's pretty close to perfect, Sean. I am serious. KILMEADE: So, I would have to say, Hannity. WATTERS: You're going with Hannity. See, I am going to go with Dobbs. KILMEADE: Why? WATTERS: Because I think he gave Trump an A-plus, so far in year one. KILMEADE: Right. WATTERS: I mean, that's a little mush. KILMEADE: All right, put it this way, do you think that Sean Hannity would grade less than A-plus? WATTERS: I don't know, maybe, A-minus, right? KILMEADE: Put it this way, we really - we should call the President. WATTERS: Okay, we'll have him decide. Next one, this is kind of mean, so I am sorry, beforehand, who would be picked last in gym class, Griff Jenkins or Steve Doocy? KILMEADE: That is kind of mean. This is just mean. WATTERS: This is bad for you. This is you know... KILMEADE: Here is a couple of things, in fairness, I'd done some - I know a lot about both men. WATTERS: You would know. KILMEADE: Yes. WATTERS: What do you know, Brian? KILMEADE: Steve peaked fifth grade wrestling... WATTERS: He wrestled. KILMEADE: He wrestled, but in fifth grade, they said, \"You are probably not going to get better, you should drop out.\" So, Griff Jenkins, you have a guy who surfs. Would you know, you have good abs. You have great abs, good coordination and well, he's very pliable... WATTERS: Let's just let the audience know you wanted me to take my jacket off before the interview? KILMEADE: I thought it would look good. It's like a newsroom kind of work and breaking the story. WATTERS: Now, but Griff does Iron Man competitions. He bikes, he runs, he swims, and he surfs. What does Steve do? KILMEADE: It has to be a verb, right? An action word. Steve cooks. I am not sure that's even a complex (inaudible)... WATTERS: Okay, you know what, this is over. So, Doocy is getting picked last. Can we agree? KILMEADE: Thank you, yes. WATTERS: Okay, you're going to have a hard time in the next \"Fox & Friends.\" Biggest goody two shoes on the channel. Dana Perino or Todd Starnes? KILMEADE: Wow. WATTERS: This is a tough one. KILMEADE: This is unbelievable. Very similar. They profile the same way. WATTERS: Yes. KILMEADE: Todd Starnes, kind of a radio guy. Here part on the side, Dana wears her hair down, so those are two things I just said. WATTERS: Is that how we are defining this? KILMEADE: A little bit. Because you didn't get... WATTERS: Just warm up. Just warm up. KILMEADE: Because Jesse, keep in mind, for the audience at home, and it's a big audience because I have seen them, you did not give me this questions ahead of time, so I am talking out loud almost like \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" WATTERS: We usually have you talk out loud. KILMEADE: I just want you to hear me thinking out loud. WATTERS: Okay, so listen... (CROSSTALK) KILMEADE: I would say Dana Perino. WATTERS: Perino has a bigger... KILMEADE: Because she has no dark side. WATTERS: That's true. KILMEADE: I've surveilled her from a distance. No dark side in the woman. WATTERS: But wait, Todd Starnes, I don't believe drinks, I don't believe dances. He thinks dancing is the devil. But know Perino drinks. KILMEADE: But you're not seeing the linkage. If you get Todd to drink, he danced, so I don't think, yes... WATTERS: So, who are we going with, you're going with Perino is the bigger goody-two shoes? KILMEADE: Dana Perino, without - in fairness to Todd, I know that he is better. This is a tossup. I can't decide. WATTERS: Cushiest gig on the network? Phil Keating or Phil Keating? KILMEADE: I would say Phil. I would say Phil Keating and I will say here is why. He has never buttoned his top button ever. WATTERS: Never. He doesn't button his second button. KILMEADE: Right, If you kept him indoors... WATTERS: Yes. No one can keep him indoors. KILMEADE: No, if you did. He would still be tan. So, right there... WATTERS: I think you're right. KILMEADE: He'll still have that sandy beach look. WATTERS: That's right. Yes, we only see him on New Year's Eve and it's at the Miami Club. KILMEADE: He has never footwear with laces, so I say Phil Keating wins this hands down. WATTERS: We're going with Phil, okay, that was easy. Most fun person to hit the bars with? Gutfeld or Kimberly Guilfoyle? KILMEADE: Guilfoyle. WATTERS: Why do you say that, Brian? KILMEADE: Because... WATTERS: What's so funny? KILMEADE: It's just no question, because Guilfoyle has got the the intellect, the background. She could talk... WATTERS: You want to go to the bar with someone with an intellect. KILMEADE: Yes. Someone who can have a wide-ranging sort of a conversation because I am - I'm just tired of talking about myself. WATTERS: Really? I have never seen that happen. KILMEADE: So I would take that. But I've had drinks with both of them. WATTERS: I am going to go with Kimberly. But it's close because Gutfeld likes wine and he is a lot of fun, too. KILMEADE: And I will say this, Gutfeld, better body. If it's that goal, you could face (inaudible).. WATTERS: Whatever you like, it's fine with me. Hardest worker at Fox? Jesse Watters or Brian Kilmeade? KILMEADE: Okay. WATTERS: You seem offended. I mean, listen, just because you do two hours in the morning, and then do the three-hour radio show, and then fill in sometimes doesn't necessarily make you a hard worker. I had to get to where I am at by slaving away on the streets for \"The Factor\" for many, many years. You didn't have to do that. You work in a studio. You don't win an Emmy in a studio. KILMEADE: I did not slave away for years, but I didn't work eight hours and just get three minutes. I work six hours to give you six hours. WATTERS: Are you insulting the \"Watters' World\" packages? KILMEADE: Absolutely, and you would carry - Rob Monaco, let's tell the city - he was producing all the credits. WATTERS: Yes, absolutely. The \"Fox & Friends\" producers have something to say about that. KILMEADE: And guess what, here's something else, guess who edits his piece? WATTERS: The producers, okay. KILMEADE: I am going to look better and better. I probably even look as shiny as I do right now in real life. WATTERS: You can't look better than you already look. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) KILMEADE: Wow, that was very nice of Jesse to say that. That was a lot of fun. And that was our radio show. Don't forget to listen nine to noon. Meanwhile, coming up straight ahead, \"Watters' World\" bringing back one of your favorite segments, it's called \"Mugshot Mania.\" That story is next. Take that camera. All right, they say a picture is worth a thousand words. Never is that more true than when it comes to \"Mugshot Mania.\" Here to help me break down some of the good, some of the bad, and some the ugliest is standup comedian himself, Jimmy Failla, Jimmy, welcome. JIMMY FAILLA, STANDUP COMEDIAN: Hey, man, great to see you. KILMEADE: Are you ready to look at some mugshots? FAILLA: Let's do it man. KILMEADE: Some people that are wanted or less than wanted. FAILLA: Probably my relatives. KILMEADE: Okay, fantastic. Let's talk Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Police arrested a man based on a cartoon drawing hung police arrested a man based on a cartoon drawing. Hung Nguyen was arrested for theft after stealing money from a grocery store. Can you believe that that stick figure produced a criminal? FAILLA: Yes, I'd like to thank the cops for catching him and the kindergartner for drawing him. KILMEADE: It's incredible. FAILLA: I hope that kid gets a free fidget spinner out of the deal. He looks - he actually half looks like the front man in a Phil Collins cover band. KILMEADE: Right. FAILLA: I think he kind of looks like he might have stolen that money to get drums or something like that. KILMEADE: Well, put it this way, a couple of things, whoever drew it, and then whoever released it? And said, okay, this will definitely lead to something, or a laugh at the very least. All right, let's move on. Jonathan Rivera arrested n Connecticut for attempting to steal a car, drove to his court appearance in another car, and there he is from two different angles. What about the wisdom here, Jimmy? FAILLA: You know on the flip side of this, though, because, we're like, this guy is insane, but think of how his bail is going to be because the judge knows this is a guy that shows up to court. KILMEADE: Right. FAILLA: You know, this guy is going to find a way to get there, and I read a little bit about him. He was actually going to take an Uber, but he figured there was going to be criminal in the driver's seat either way, so he just might as well be the criminal. KILMEADE: I've seen over a hundred of that problem. FAILLA: Yes, there it is KILMEADE: Yes, look out for that app, dude, at your own risk. All right, so there you go, at least you know what? He is being sincere. Next, composite image of a man wanted in the u.k. for burglary based on a description given by a witness. Look at that smile. It's not natural. FAILLA: Yes, the police report says he was last seen standing in front of a fun house mirror. This guy is a hungry, hungry hippo legend. Someone has heard about him. That is a weird mouth. Maybe he ate one of those Carolina reaper peppers where it swells up your face. KILMEADE: Yes. FAILLA: I don't know what to make of that guy. KILMEADE: You know, the thing is weird because his teeth look normal, his face looks normal, but together they don't look normal, and believe it or not, he has not been caught. FAILLA: He hasn't been found? KILMEADE: Can you believe that? FAILLA: That's so weird. He's blending in with the donkeys. KILMEADE: You know, I would see not finding somebody here, but that's a very small country, we should be able to find him. All right, meanwhile William Lara Garcia arrested in Virginia in December for stealing a car wearing a \"Trust Me\" t-shirt in his mug shot. So, I mean, right there he looks guilty... FAILLA: Oh that's a bad look, right, just the face alone, forget the t- shirt, but I do trust this guy, more than I trust Facebook, if I am being fair. KILMEADE: I mean if you cry in your mug shot, should you have your time cut in half? FAILLA: I want to say this, if you cry in your mug shot, you should keep that to yourself in prison. That simply does not end good. KILMEADE: Absolutely, yes, you don't want to say, \"I was just weeping, give me a second, Sarg.\" All right, meanwhile, Kevin Gibson, arrested in Miami Beach, April 2016 drinking in public and possession of marijuana with intent to sell. There is something weird about that shot. You know what it is, Jimmy? FAILLA: It's that his barber wore a t-shirt that said, \"Trust me.\" That's my guess. KILMEADE: For one thing, I do wonder sometimes you have half a beard, but never down the middle. FAILLA: Yes, yes, I mean, I think the moral of the story here is never go to a barber that gets paid in the bath salts. I think it's one, but yes, that's hard to blend into a police lineup. Because there is nobody else with your look, if you know what I mean? You've got to think about that one. KILMEADE: Criminals not the smartest, that's why they are caught. FAILLA: Although, we're still looking for that guy in the UK. KILMEADE: Jimmy, where can we watch you? FAILLA: My standup special - my one hour special, \"State of the Union\" is on Amazon Prime, right now. KILMEADE: Right now. FAILLA: If you tune in tonight after the show, you will double my ratings. Come on then. KILMEADE: More importantly, do you get money? FAILLA: Of course, royalty, we are going out, Kilmeade. You and me. KILMEADE: All right, you got it. Jimmy, we'll click it on your face. FAILLA: Let's do it. Thanks, man. KILMEADE: All right, good job. Thanks so much. FAILLA: The best. KILMEADE: Awesome, meanwhile, up next, last call, little league style. All right, time now for a double dose of last call, sports edition in honor of myself. Check out this young baseball player going viral this week during a very intense little league game over in California. The coach told 3-year-old going Lennox Salcedo to run as fast as he can to his home plate and he didn't disappoint, cracking up fans as he gloriously run slow motion, at the very least, this kid has a future in acting. You will see a coach come out and try to push him through. He will not have any of it. It is fantastic. Moving now to the golf course, where most times you hope to sink a few birdies, other times, you get attacked by one. That's what happened to this Michigan high school student, apparently, the 16-year-old named Isaac Cooling angered a foul as he strolled past the nest. Now, goose not having any of it, chase Cooling, knocked him on his back side and eventually bit him in the butt. I guess, that's the last time the student will be taking a gander at some geese. And you thought golf was kind of boring, well, I have news for you and it's sad news, that's all we have for tonight. Jesse will be back next which, which is good news, and you can catch me hosting \"Legend and Lies.\" That will be tomorrow at 8:00 repeated again at 11:00. Up next is \"Justice with Judge Jeanine.\" And if I have some time, you will see a side shot and I am going to pretend to write. END Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

            "article_content": "father and child, adopt the kid (iStock) Fewer people are celebrating Father\u2019s Day than ever before, a fact that may have less to do with the nature of the holiday than it does with the nature of American families. A U.S. Census Bureau study found that the percentage of children living in single-parent households increased from 12 percent in 1960 to 31 percent in 2016. During that same timeframe, \u201cthe percentage of children living with only their mother nearly tripled.\u201d These numbers are sobering because according to recent studies, kids who lack an engaged father (and so may be less likely to observe Father\u2019s Day) are also less likely to experience a healthy, contented, and successful life. I had only celebrated a handful of Father\u2019s Days with my kids when I first recognized this truth. I was assigned to our police department\u2019s Gang Detail at the time, investigating young gang members in Los Angeles County. Our city was culturally and ethnically diverse, but we had a gang problem that seemed to transcend ethnic, cultural, or socio-economic boundaries. The gang members we encountered were racially and ethnically diverse, representing local white, Hispanic, African-American and Asian-American gangs. They came from a variety of economic settings, from very wealthy neighborhoods to impoverished segments of our community. As a young father myself, I wanted to understand what caused the young men and women in our community to become gang members in the first place. It certainly didn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with their race, culture or economic status, given the fact that they didn\u2019t share any of these attributes. The more I got to know these young gang members, the better I understood their common dilemma: all of them suffered from \u201clack of dad.\u201d This \u201clack of dad\u201d looked different for each gang member, depending on his or her situation. Some gang members had fathers who were uninvolved, alcoholic or \u201cdeadbeat\u201d dads. Some never knew their fathers and were raised in single-parent households by their mothers or grandmothers. Some were part of multigenerational gang families with fathers who had been incarcerated for most of their lives. Some simply had dads who worked obsessively and paid them little attention. I repeatedly observed the same shared attributes in these gang members: They were struggling to find direction or establish a moral compass, largely because they didn\u2019t have a father at home to model what it meant to be a man \u2013 or to be loved by one. Many national studies\u00a0have confirmed my own anecdotal observations. Fathers are essential to boys and girls. Studies have repeatedly shown that children who are raised with involved fathers are less likely to struggle academically, repeat a grade, get expelled or suspended from school, and get pregnant as teenage girls. Children with involved fathers are more likely to attend college, get a good job and stay out of jail. Studies also show that kids raised without involved fathers are more likely to live in poverty, be abused or neglected, use drugs or alcohol and commit crimes. Kids aren\u2019t the only who benefit from engaged dads. Fatherhood also benefits fathers. Researchers have recently discovered that fathers who are engaged with their kids are less likely to suffer from stress and depression and are more likely to have increased self-esteem, job and relationship satisfaction, and confidence in their parenting skills. Fatherhood increases one\u2019s competence in a number of important areas of character development, including the formation of patience, humility and selflessness. My days as a Gang Detail officer taught me that every version of \u201clack of dad\u201d is equally damaging; none is better (or worse) than any other. My days as a father taught me much more about myself, my priorities and my role in the lives of my kids. So, this year, as Americans spend far less time, energy and money celebrating Father\u2019s Day than they do celebrating Mother\u2019s Day, I\u2019m determined to develop a renewed enthusiasm for the holiday and a renewed appreciation for the role of fathers.",

(Google Maps/iStock) One New Jersey charter school\u2019s decision to turn away students on the first day of classes for seemingly minor dress code violations has outraged many, both within and beyond the school community. On August 27, reportedly \u201chalf\u201d of the high schoolers enrolled at Marion P. Thomas Charter School\u00a0in Newark were dismissed upon arrival for their first day of classes for being out of uniform, NJ.com reports. KENTUCKY STUDENT JAILED FOR FIGHT OVER DRESS CODE PROTEST T-SHIRT As the students proceeded to gather at a nearby park, local basketball coach Ma'at Mys spotted the group and paused the youth basketball camp he was running to investigate what happened. \u201cMarion P Thomas locked their doors to students who don\u2019t have belts or all black shoes,\u201d Mys wrote in a Facebook post with footage he captured at the time of conversations between himself and the Thomas students. \u201cThis is how charter schools help high risk children. If you have a child at the school, reach out to them.\u201d The clip has since gone viral with over 121,000 views and sparked great debate on the social platform. While some Facebook commenters voiced support for the teens\u2019 dismissal over the uniform abuses, others were furious that the students were refused entry - on the first day of classes - and were effectively locked out of the building. Meanwhile, Interim Chief School Administrator Misha Simmonds told NJ.com that parents were immediately contacted if their child had been dismissed, and that school officials soon acknowledged that \u201cturning students away wasn't the best approach for student safety.\u201d School administrators issued a letter next day that did not apologize for the incident but explained the logic behind the controversial decision. \u201cSince its inception, Marion P. Thomas Charter School has had a uniform policy. The policy is intended to help our school promote a more effective learning environment, foster school unity and bridge socioeconomic differences between children. Wearing a uniform teaches students appropriate dress and decorum in school, helps to improve student conduct and discipline and prepares them for their future workplace,\u201d the statement read. \u201cOur high school team wanted to ensure our students complied with this policy, for all of the reasons aforementioned. Their best intentions led to some students being asked to return home. We have communicated with our families who were impacted by this decision. \"While we realize school policies are important, we recognize that our students\u2019 well-being is our utmost importance. Therefore, we have implemented a process that will not compromise the safety of our high school students.\u201d FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS Moving forward, the Thomas school has launched a fundraiser to gather regulation uniforms, footwear and accessories to \u201cstock an emergency closet for our students.\u201d In addition, Thomas students have been provided black tape to conceal any white detailing on their school shoes, Yahoo Lifestyle reports.",

            "article_content": "A new report says Democrats are not seeing a boost in Latino support ahead of midterms as Hispanic unemployment hits another record low under the president. Hispanic Americans are rapidly becoming the embodiment of a new political narrative \u2013 one that isn\u2019t being written by politicians, and isn\u2019t pegged to the unnecessarily divisive issue of immigration. The developing narrative of the Latino community is one about economic opportunity. This young, growing, entrepreneurial demographic is today\u2019s most vivid example of what can happen when government creates the right environment for entrepreneurs and workers to do what they do best. The benefits of an improved economic environment, created through lower taxes and regulatory relief, are reflected in both the Hispanic unemployment rate \u2013 which has reached\u00a0an all-time low and is going lower\u00a0\u2013 and in the\u00a0ten percent rise in Hispanics\u2019 approval rating of President Trump. For too long, Hispanics have been treated in the political arena as monolithic \u2013 as if they are a single-issue group that must be placated in a certain way in order to harvest a winning percentage of their considerable voting numbers. It was easy to characterize and target the community in this way when Latinos were visibly suffering, growing in numbers but not in socio-economic power. Today, Hispanics are on the rise in every way. They start businesses at a faster rate than any other demographic group, they have high employment and they are actively improving the economic and social outlook for their children. It is past time for politicians to view this important group accordingly. For perspective, they ought to consider a recent Economist/YouGov poll indicating that a minority of Latinos support Obama-administration-era \u201ccatch and release\u201d immigration policies, and a majority \u2013 by a two-to-one margin! \u2013 believe that immigration enforcement isn\u2019t strict enough. Hispanic Americans are an economically vibrant, ambitious community with a variety of views on the issues of the day. This fact requires politicians to appeal to Hispanics in a new way \u2013 with an emphasis on economic opportunity. This may require a new mindset for many leaders, where they begin to think of Hispanic Americans as simply \u201cAmericans\u201d \u2013 interested in starting a business, finding a job, climbing the social and economic ladders of opportunity and creating a better future for their families. My father \u2013 a legal Mexican immigrant whose entrepreneurial spirit and tireless work ethic drove him to achieve the American dream of citizenship, business ownership and community leadership \u2013 used to say that, in politics, there are \u201cno permanent adversaries, only permanent interests.\u201d The Trump administration is proving that a healthy environment for starting and growing the independent businesses that create jobs is a permanent interest of the Hispanic community. A dedication to creating that environment is a political characteristic that is deeply appealing to a critical mass of Latinos. Those who want to be elected or re-elected this November must take note and change the way they interact with this important, growing community.",

            "article_content": "A homeless man walks with his dog in Berkeley, Calif. (Andrew O'Reilly/Fox News) From the parks of Berkeley to the streets of Brooklyn, and in most every large city in between, they have become an almost inescapable part of urban life. Known by many names \u2013 \u201ccrusty punks,\u201d \u201ccrusties,\u201d \u201cgutter punks,\u201d \u201ccrumb bums\u201d and \u201cdirty kids,\u201d to list but a few \u2013 this group of young adults has rejected a more traditional 9-to-5 lifestyle in favor of train hopping, panhandling and voluntary homelessness. And while traditionally tolerated by police and urban residents, these transient groups of the unshaven and unwashed have been involved in a series of incidents in recent years -- accompanied by an abundance of bad press -- that has municipalities across the country puzzling over how to address the problem. In New York City's East Village, they have been spotted doing drugs in local parks, making camp outside of apartment buildings and sleeping outside storefronts. One crusty traveler\u2019s pit bull even attacked a man and his small dog - killing the other dog. \"It's like St. Marks in the '70s,\" New York City activist Philip DePaolo told the New York Daily News, referring to a once-notorious street in Manhattan. \"It's the bad old days all over again. There's crack and heroin all over the neighborhood.\" And in Berkeley, Calif.'s infamous People\u2019s Park, there have been widespread complaints about the modern-day hobos openly shooting heroin. The drug use, the panhandling, the unruly dogs and the crusties' general presence on street corners and in front of stores have all\u00a0 become too much for some cities, triggering local government crackdowns. \u201cThe current status quo of the park serves no one\u2019s interest, least of all the homeless people who occasionally use the park,\u201d Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for UC-Berkeley, told Fox News. In Berkeley, famously known as one of the country's most liberal and homeless-friendly communities, the City Council recently voted to implement new regulations including: limits on sitting down and lying on sidewalks; a ceiling on how many dogs a person can have along a commercial strip; and designations for what homeless people are allowed to sit on. \u201cNo one in this room believes homelessness is a good thing,\u201d Councilwoman Sophie Hahn said, according to the news site Berkeleyside. \u201cYet, through massive failures of our society and our way of life, it is a persistent reality in California, and across the United States.\u201d It's difficult to say just how extensive the problem is. Given the itinerant nature and wariness of those involved, experts can't say how many \u201ccrusties\u201d there are across the country. Nor is there an easy explanation for why many of these young adults -- upper-middle-class and rich kids among them -- take up such a difficult lifestyle. But after speaking with \"crusties\" around the country, and with researchers who have spent time studying the trend, it's clear there's a consensus that despite a shared penchant for dreadlocks, hiking backpacks and mutts, gutter punks are a diverse lot. \u201cThere is a remarkable variety of kids who become gutter punk,\u201d Jeff Farrell, a sociologist at Texas Christian University who has spent time traveling with them, told Fox News. \u201cMany come from broken homes, or are throwaway kids. But there are also people from affluent backgrounds. This is a very varied set of kids, just like at any high school across the country.\u201d Daniel Reitz, 26, is originally from Virginia and has been on and off the streets for the last six years. (Andrew O'Reilly/Fox News) Whatever their socioeconomic background, there seems to be a shared experience of a rough home life, sometimes abusive parents, drug abuse and unchecked mental health issues. Sitting on the sidewalk along Telegraph Avenue only a few blocks from the University of California, Berkeley campus, Daniel Reitz talks about how he was sexually abused and separated from his brothers when he was younger. \u201cI was adopted at age 9. I came from a sexually abusive family,\u201d Reitz told Fox News. \u201cThey separated me and my brothers at a really young age and it tore me apart really bad.\u201d Reitz, now 26, is originally from Virginia and has been on and off the streets for the last six years. He\u2019s hoping to make enough money to get to Reno, Nev., and from there, Washington State, so he can hike the Pacific Crest Trail with his two pit bull mixes, Zeke and Shiloh. Reitz says that he doesn\u2019t mind the itinerant lifestyle \u2013 although he does plan to end his traveling days soon. Still, he gets upset at being labeled a drug addict or criminal because of his choice to be homeless. Reitz acknowledges that he used to drink heavily and abuse drugs, but now says he doesn\u2019t even touch alcohol and only smokes marijuana. \u201cA lot of people out here stereotype me because they look at me sitting here and think I must be on drugs,\u201d Reitz told Fox News. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that I come from bad circumstances.\u201d Reitz may have curtailed his drug use, but substance abuse is in fact very common among crusties. Just as the nation continues to deal with the horrors of the opioid epidemic, heroin \u2013 and its derivatives -- has become the drug of choice for many of these street dwellers. Both prescription and illegal opioids are among the main causes of homelessness, according to experts. A 2013 study that looked at the homeless in Boston found they were nine times more likely to die from an overdose than drug users who had homes. Crusties themselves say the situation on the street has only gotten worse in recent years, as the highly potent narcotic fentanyl is mixed into batches of heroin and cocaine. \u201cIn the last year, I have been to more memorials and funerals for friends who have died from overdoes than in all the rest of my life,\u201d said Nicholas, a crusty punk in his 30s. Nicolas, who panhandles for change on Second Avenue in New York, said he had been off and on heroin for years. \u201cI\u2019m not using right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s something that is tough to kick. It makes a lot of your problems seem to disappear.\u201d Many activists who work with crusties argue that criminalizing their way of life won't get them off the streets and into more stable lifestyles. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to reach out to these kids and help because of their itinerant natures,\u201d Mark Horvath, the founder of the nonprofit organization Invisible Voices, told Fox News. \u201cYou might only get a few hours -- or even only a few minutes -- to work with these kids.\u201d",

TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Well good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Just when you thought Hillary Clinton lost the last presidential election, you realize nobody told her that. This afternoon, Hillary weighed in on the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. Here's part of what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFFREY MARK GOLDBERG, THE ATLANTIC: Brett Kavanaugh said that the \"political hit job\" directed at him was being done on behalf of the Clintons, among other people. Your response? HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Ha-ha. Ha-ha. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Ooh, that laugh, it haunts your dreams. We'll have more on that and what it means because it is revealing later in the show. Also, a new investigation reveals who exactly is funding many of the protesters you've seen scream at Republicans in public. You probably won't be surprised but we have confirmation tonight. First though, when the Senate decided to delay Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote for a week in order to enable an FBI investigation, everyone who was not Jeff Flake understood the point of it. The investigation itself was irrelevant. For Democrats, the only purpose was to buy time so that new people, some of them anonymously, could make allegations against Kavanaugh. That's exactly what happened, of course, and we've been the first to scoff at some of these claims because some have been frivolous, unfounded, some have been absurd. But tonight, we must tell you a new and troubling story has emerged that could alter the trajectory not simply of the Kavanaugh nomination but of the history of this country. It is a story of a young man, outwardly respectable but so morally distorted within, so addled by chronic dependency on draught beer, the witnesses say he committed a particularly heinous form of assault in a public place. This man, this monster in human form, once tossed an ice cube at someone in a bar. Yes, an ice cube, the perfect weapon, in solid form, deadly. And then, within hours, it melts and evaporates into the air, all physical evidence turns to vapor. There are no fingerprints. It's diabolical. The perfect crime. And frankly, from a constitutional standpoint it is disqualifying. Now, we'll concede that we missed the significance of this story at first. But the other networks were on it long before we were. Watch their coverage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) JOHN BERMAN, CNN: --police documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh threw ice in someone's face. --threw ice in someone's face-- DON LEMON, CNN: --accused him of throwing ice-- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --accused Kavanaugh of throwing ice on him. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The nominee threw ice on him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --accused him of throwing ice on him for \"some unknown reason.\" (END VIDEO CLIPS) CARLSON: Icegate. Well the founders, the framers of our Constitution anticipated this very moment. Article III of the Constitution in words well known to every first-year law student are unequivocal on this subject. \"Whoever shall throw ice in a tavern is disqualified from service in the federal judiciary.\" Game over. And yet, ladies and gentlemen, there is more tonight. A former Yale student called Tad Low who apparently overlapped with Brett Kavanaugh in school has contacted the FBI with a brand new outrage. Low says that at one time at a frat party, some fraternity brothers hired a prostitute to put on some kind of show that Low found offensive. Now, what does this have to do with Brett Kavanaugh, you might wonder? Well as Low concedes, nothing directly. \"I can't say for certain that Judge Kavanaugh was present in the frat house.\" And yet, and this is the critical part of this story, Brett Kavanaugh may have been in the State of Connecticut when this happened, the very same state at the very same time that people in a fraternity house were doing things that Ted Low didn't like. Need we say more? Totally and utterly disqualifying. Still confused? Watch CNN. They'll explain. There've been a lot of stories like this lately. You may have noticed. Julie Swetnick, for example, claims that 37 years ago, for some reason, she went to 10 gang-rape parties in a row in suburban Maryland, and that Brett Kavanaugh may have been at some of them. What did Brett Kavanaugh do at these parties? Well Swetnick signed a sworn statement suggesting that Kavanaugh and friends added drugs and alcohol to the punch that facilitated the rapes that took place at these parties. Now, that's a very serious charge except as sweatness - Swetnick just explained in a televised interview, she didn't really mean it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JULIE SWETNICK, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH ACCUSER: I saw him around the punch, I won't say bowls, or the punch containers, I don't know what he did, but I saw him by them, yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Well you've heard Democrats talk a lot recently about how Brett Kavanaugh may have lied under oath. There's no evidence for that. There is now though quite a bit of evidence that Julie Swetnick just did. Democrats don't care. They're not interested in finding out because \"Hey, whatever works. Power is the point.\" And yet, they should care. Sexual assault is a horrifying crime no matter who commits it. All decent people understand that. False claims trivialize the offense. And there have been a number of widely publicized false claims over the past 15 years, and they undermine the many assault victims who are telling the truth. They make the search for justice seem political which it never should be. And worst of all, they are making the rest of us nearly as cynical as professional Democrats already are. That's a high cost. Mollie Hemingway is the Senior Editor at The Federalist, and she joins us tonight. So, IceCubegate. Is this one of those moments that looking back on it 15 years from now, we're going to cringe in embarrassment that adults with college degrees could have taken something like this seriously? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: I would hope that we look back on this and cringe in embarrassment. I'm worried that this is the direction that things are going and that this type of attack will be used to discredit anyone that the media feels is a political enemy. And what you've seen, I mean, yes, Icegate is a ridiculous story. And I want to clarify, the claim is that he may or may not have thrown ice, which is even more ridiculous than that he might have thrown ice. And-- CARLSON: Right. HEMINGWAY: --and to make this be a big explosive expose is ridiculous. But all of them have been kind of increasingly ridiculous. And none of them have had supporting evidence. And so, this is a very dangerous path to go down. And I'm worried that unless people really take a strong stand against this type of reporting and against this type of media campaign, where you just throw as many stories out there as possible, never mind the fact that they are uncorroborated, unsubstantiated or patently ridiculous that they will continue in the future. CARLSON: So, but this is an asymmetrical event. So, on the one side you have people who are willing to do anything and lie about it. The Washington Post, for example, a purely political operation funded by the world's richest man, writes stories for their political effect. That's the point. And yet, Republicans are playing by a set of rules devised in the 18th Century and they're very literal. Well there's a story, we must take it seriously. At what point do Republicans say, \"You know what, this is a lie. I know the game. I get the joke. I'm not playing along.\" HEMINGWAY: Right. There's a difference between joining with them in - in a very bad game where you attack people based on what they did in high school and otherwise-- CARLSON: Exactly. HEMINGWAY: --but also you - that doesn't mean that you have to put up with it or go along with it or treat these things as - as sane, even. I mean a lot of these allegations never should have been promulgated by the media to begin with. People are saying, \"Oh, well we put this person on air so we can all see that she is ridiculous.\" Well that's true. You can see that some of these allegations are ridiculous when - when you show light on them. But there should be a basic standard. I mean this is a human being who is being torn apart through this process. And then, also, even if they're acknowledging that some of the stories are ridiculous, at the same time they're putting forth stories of - that are ridiculous on their own. And so, there's just a lot of problems overall. CARLSON: So why - I mean final quick question, but why does it fall to Lindsey Graham of all people to be the only Member of the United States Senate to say that out loud? Are there no other members who feel an obligation to protect their voters from false charges and to protect the country from falling into some kind of mob rule situation, which it is? HEMINGWAY: I think - I think this is a very frustrating moment for a lot of people of goodwill whether they're Left or Right, they see what's going on. They know it's wrong. And yet, so many people who they expect to be leaders in Washington D.C. or otherwise are behaving as if what's going on is completely acceptable. CARLSON: Yes. HEMINGWAY: More people than Lindsey Graham should be standing up and saying \"Halt the madness. This is insane. This is a real family. This is a real man. And this is a real country that has standards and we are not living up to those standards.\" CARLSON: Normal people would like to be protected from the stuff they're exposed and in danger and their representatives don't seem to care. Mollie, thank you very much. HEMINGWAY: Thank you. CARLSON: Senator Jeff Flake said he was going to vote one way. Then he was screamed at in an elevator by a protester and immediately changed his opinion. So, that works. And that's why other lawmakers are now being targeted by protesters. Guess who's funding them? We'll tell you. You probably already know. Plus, the President is speaking tonight in Mississippi. We're monitoring that speech. Of course, if news breaks, we'll be there immediately. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --top, top in his class at Yale Law School. He's led like a life that's unbelievable. He's had no problems. They've never taken them out of restaurants. They've never did - this is like a person that everybody thought at the highest level. On both sides, they said someday he will be a Supreme Court Judge, right? (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona announced initially he planned to vote yes for Brett Kavanaugh. And then he was confronted by two protesters in an elevator in the Senate. That was on tape. There it is. One of the women who was screaming at him, it turns out, is a professional activist on the payroll of billionaire George Soros. Her name is Ana Maria Archila. She's co-executive director at the Center for Popular Democracy, which Soros funds. Another protestor, who harassed Senators Mitch McConnell and Bob Corker, also, amazingly, works for that group. Congressman Jim Jordan is a Republican. He represents the State of Ohio. He sits in the House Judiciary Committee. And we're happy to have him tonight. Congressman, are you surprised to learn this? REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: No. I mean the Left has gone completely crazy. I mean you think about this. They applaud Kaepernick and they try to destroy Judge Kavanaugh. That - that's the - that's the modern-day Left, so doesn't really surprise me. I said this the other day to a group I was addressing that they applaud Kaepernick when he disrespects the flag, they embraced Cuomo when he said America was never that great, and they cheer on Maxine Waters when she encourages people to go harass Republicans like what happened to Senator Flake so, this is just the Left. And I think Americans see through this. And that's why so many folks across our district and, frankly, I was in Texas last week, I think around the country, want Judge Kavanaugh to be on the court and know he deserves to be on the court. CARLSON: It's just a little weird to see this from a non-profit in Washington. I mean you think of non-profit organizations in D.C. as producing backgrounders helping formulate policy, it's impossible to imagine the Heritage Foundation saying to two employees, high level ones, \"Hey go to National Airport and scream at Mazie Hirono as she gets in her Uber.\" JORDAN: Yes. CARLSON: I mean probably just so is that a legitimate-- JORDAN: We-- CARLSON: --use of a non-profit? JORDAN: Well, I don't think so. But that's the Left today. I mean my wife and I got the - what I call the treatment two days after Maxine Waters clear back in June said \"Go harass people who support the President,\" we got the treatment at the theater here in town. So look, we would - you and I would never do that to someone at a restaurant-- CARLSON: Of course not. JORDAN: --at some public event, but the Left now thinks that's appropriate because look, again, they applaud Kaepernick, they attack and try to destroy Kavanaugh, that is the Left today. And frankly, as we head into this campaign, I think that is what how we should frame this up. Here's the Left and all their craziness and then look at the record under President Trump's leadership in the last 20 months, how amazing that is. Frame it up like that. If we do that, I think we can win. Think about the 20 - lowest unemployment in - in 20 years, 4.2 percent growth rate, taxes have been cut, regulations reduced, Kavanaugh going on the court, Gorsuch already there, we're out of that crazy Iran deal, the embassies in Jerusalem, the hostages have been returned from North Korea, contrast those up, I think we can win, particularly, when you demonstrate here is what the radical Left is up to in this country. That is what this election's about-- CARLSON: Right. JORDAN: --and I hope that's the message we take across the country. CARLSON: So very quick, for those of us who worry that this is accelerating into a really scary place, has anyone ever thought about going over to Maxine Waters' office and saying \"You know, I get that we disagree. But please don't encourage physical confrontation or violence because, you know, that's dangerous?\" JORDAN: No. I - I don't know if that's been done. But I - I appreciate Liberals who - who come from a different perspective. I - I was good friends when he was here in Congress. CARLSON: I hear too. JORDAN: Dennis Kucinich, a friend of mine. And we agreed-- CARLSON: Good yes. JORDAN: --on so many - so many First Amendment issues, Fourth Amendment, Bill of Rights issues, civil liberties, we could work together. But now, the - the Left, they don't seem to be where Dennis was. And he and I could work together on things. CARLSON: I agree. JORDAN: That is a scary thing for this country. And I know you know that and that's why it's so important you keep talking about this like you have been. CARLSON: Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, thank you very much. JORDAN: Thank you. CARLSON: Dana Perino is the person we talk to when we want to understand the political ramifications of all this. Obviously, she hosts \"The Daily Briefing\" every day at 2 o'clock and she's the star of \"The Five,\" the singular one, I would say. But that's just my view. DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS: Thank you for having me. CARLSON: So, what is the political effect of the Kavanaugh saga? PERINO: As the President likes to say, we'll see what happens. It is really high stakes and everybody is super engaged. They were sort of like waiting like what would be the October surprise? Well I think that actually the Kavanaugh is it. For Republicans, they could benefit in certain places, for example, in the states like North Dakota. CARLSON: Yes. PERINO: You see Heidi Heitkamp now down 10 to her Republican challenger. That's really big and it's going to be hard for her to come back from that. Also Missouri, Indiana, and West Virginia, but it could help Democrats in House seats and also some gubernatorial seats. And it might help them where races are really tight in Senate races like New Jersey and Florida, maybe Nevada and Arizona. So, I think from that perspective we don't know. There are, I think, three Democratic sets of parties that are going to, I think - call it - call it the Kavanaugh blast zone-- CARLSON: Yes. PERINO: --then they're not happy about it. The first ones would be the red-state Democrats who face voters in five weeks, those are those people like Heidi Heitkamp, I mentioned, Joe Manchin, Joe Donnelly, all of them are in states where the polling shows that Republicans strongly support the President, they strongly support Judge Kavanaugh and that one of the number one reasons they went to vote in 2016 was the Supreme Court. Then the second one would be the 2020 Democratic Senators who want to run for president but they're not on the Judiciary Committee. CARLSON: Right. PERINO: Right now, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker are having all the fun. And people like Elizabeth Warren, she has to figure out a way to stay in the news. So, this past weekend, she said, \"By the way, I might run for president,\" after just three weeks ago saying \"Of course, I'm not going to run for president.\" So, they're trying to figure out how to get in there. But the biggest loser probably will be Joe Biden, who actually arguably could be one of their most - their - their best candidates against Donald Trump in 2020-- CARLSON: Yes. PERINO: --but because of this, and if you go back to the Anita Hill hearings, he's going to have such a hill to overcome that they might have just shot him in the foot. CARLSON: Interesting. So but you think if it hadn't been for this, he would have been a legitimate contender? PERINO: Well, I think timing is everything. CARLSON: Right. PERINO: And of course, you could say there's all these improbabilities for why but one name ID is super important, and he has the highest name ID of any Democrat. He's certainly testing the waters to see if he could run. And he's got energy and he wants to fight against Trump, and he's one of those Democrats that might be able to bring back some of those blue-collar workers that you write about in your great new book, Ship of Fools that you won't promote on your own show. CARLSON: Well you put a bow on that sentence. I - I thought Joe Biden had a shot in 1988, so he might be one of these perpetual -- PERINO: That's - well that's why President Trump - Trump calls him the 1 percent Joe. CARLSON: It's pretty funny. Dana, great to see you. Thank you. PERINO: Thanks for having me. CARLSON: The ACLU used to stand up for, indeed, stand for civil liberties. They're the ones who reminded us that due process is the most important thing. Not anymore. They say they know for certain Kavanaugh is guilty, no trial necessary. What happened to them? We'll tell you next. Plus, President is speaking in Mississippi tonight. We're monitoring his speech, in case news occurs, in which case we will be there in a flash. That's our promise. Stay tuned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: --running for president and then Obama took him off the trash heap, right? Biden, I hear Biden wants to take me to the back of a barn. He would be in big trouble. I will tell you. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Well the conflagration over Judge Brett Kavanaugh is quickly growing out of control. It's turning into a wildfire that threatens its own creators because as you know the revolution always consumes the people who started it. Case in point, Senate challenger Beto O'Rourke who's running against Ted Cruz in Texas is now apologizing, groveling in a craven way for what misdeed? Well it turns out, he wrote a musical review at the age of 19 for the Columbia student newspaper. He was known as Robert then. He was fresh out of boarding school. In that piece, he says this that the Will Rogers Follies had actresses who were chosen \"For their phenomenally large breasts and tight buttocks.\" So, he's obviously evil. Would ignore this whole thing as dumb and irrelevant but that would be a mistake. We says - it says somewhere in the Constitution we just learned, by the way, I think, on MSNBC, that dumb college essays categorically disqualify you from serving in the U.S. Senate. At the very minimum, we ought to have an FBI investigation to see if O'Rourke, I don't know, ever admitted to not liking Toni Morrison novels, maybe two FBI investigations because we need to know. Well the ACLU has been around a long time. And it built its reputation defending free speech and especially due process, especially for the politically unpopular. It saved lives at the beginning of its existence. That was the whole point of the ACLU. Those traditional principles are being washed away though in the tide of derangement that has now seized the Left and the ACLU has decided to join that tide. They are now running an ad declaring Kavanaugh guilty without the need for a trial or in fact any evidence. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We've seen this before. Denials from powerful men. FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: I did not have sexual relations with that woman. BILL COSBY, COMEDIAN: I've never seen anything like this. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH: I categorically and unequivocally deny - deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: America is watching. And as we choose a lifetime seat on our highest court, integrity matters, and we cannot have any doubt. Senator Gardner oppose the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Chris Hahn is a radio show host, former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, probably a donor to the ACLU and he joins us tonight. Chris, it's great to see you. CHRISTOPHER HAHN, RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes. CARLSON: So you're, you know, pushing late middle-age, like I am. You've been around long enough to remember what the ACLU has been doing for the past-- HAHN: Wait, wait, wait late? CARLSON: Whatever unless, you know, you're probably-- HAHN: Middle-aged. CARLSON: --over 30. HAHN: Middle-aged. CARLSON: We're middle-aged. HAHN: I am. CARLSON: But you've watched the ACLU over time-- HAHN: Yes. CARLSON: --and you know they were founded to defend free speech and due process, civil liberties. And yet, here they just ran an ad suggesting a man is guilty on the basis of no evidence because he shares some resemblance to two other guys, who are probably guilty. That's guilt by association. That's the opposite of due process. Why is the ACLU doing this, I wonder? HAHN: Well they're not declaring him guilty. In fact, I don't think anybody's trying to declare him guilty. What we're trying to do is pick a Supreme Court Justice, and guilt or innocence is really not the issue here. He's not on trial for his life. He's applying for a job. We've got to ask the question has he been truthful in that inquiry, and the answer is no, I would say. I don't know for sure about the sexual assault allegation although I do believe Dr. Ford. But I do know that some of the things-- CARLSON: Wait, wait -- HAHN: --he talked about last Thursday-- CARLSON: Wait, wait, wait, hold on, I'm - I'm sorry-- HAHN: --he was not forthcoming about. CARLSON: --OK, OK. So, before we get to what you think he specifically lied about, I just want to rewind a second to what you said because it strikes me as amazing. You're saying that without finding someone guilty of anything, it's OK to destroy his reputation to the point where he can't get paying work, and can't get the job that he was nominated for by the President of the United States. No, I'm - I'm serious. He just had to withdraw as a lecturer at Harvard-- HAHN: Right. CARLSON: --because his reputation has been so sullied. He hasn't been found guilty of anything. There's no actual evidence to show he did anything, but that's OK with you because-- HAHN: Right. CARLSON: --we're not in a trial, is that what you're saying? That's the new standard? HAHN: What I'm saying is you got to ask the question, is this man fit for a lifetime appointment that will never ever face the voters, will never face Congress again, and if you feel in your heart that this man may have committed this thing or he hasn't been truthful to that committee, which-- CARLSON: Oh-- HAHN: --I will tell you I don't believe he was truthful-- CARLSON: Wait, wait, wait, hold on so that's - I just want to get-- HAHN: --to the committee. CARLSON: --I - he lied but that's un-provable so it's not even worth debating on TV, I would say. But to the first point -- HAHN: Well they all are. CARLSON: --the standard is if you feel in your heart, so if I feel in my heart that you're a-- HAHN: Yes. CARLSON: --child molester, I don't have any actual evidence, can I start telling people that on TV and see how it affects your family and how it affects your employment? What your kids think of it? HAHN: I am - I am not running - I am not-- CARLSON: Well no if I feel in my heart like sincerely feel in my heart-- HAHN: --I - I am not - I am not trying to get a lifetime appointment on the bench and nobody's accusing-- CARLSON: OK. Well, no but - but, hold on, that's a single -- HAHN: --him of anything that somebody did not come forward credibly-- CARLSON: --OK, but, well I don't - I don't know-- HAHN: --accused him. He was credibly accused of something but let's-- CARLSON: --no but, but, but, no, but hold on, hold on-- HAHN: You know, Tucker-- CARLSON: --he's been accused of a lot of things. Credibly is a subjective term. Is it OK if you, quote, feel in your heart that someone's guilty to systematically destroy him and his family? And you're saying yes because it's so important because abortion or whatever. But is that really a standard-- HAHN: Did you - did you find-- CARLSON: --you want to live under ? HAHN: --did you find Dr. Ford credible? CARLSON: I - I'm not really sure. I - she wasn't asked real questions like for example, when did you recall this? HAHN: Well-- CARLSON: Have you known it for 30 years and not said it to one person and then told your therapist about it? HAHN: --well, you-- CARLSON: That's a - that's the basic question. Nobody asked it-- HAHN: --you're smart enough to know that-- CARLSON: --because you're too afraid, that's why. HAHN: --that survive - you're smart enough and to know that traumatic experiences sometimes you only remember the trauma not all the-- CARLSON: I don't know what I know. I don't know what I know. That's why I ask real questions on my show. HAHN: ----other details around it. You're smart enough to know that. CARLSON: I'm not bullied into silence by a bunch of-- HAHN: So - so, I - I found her credible and I think-- CARLSON: --activists. HAHN: --I think - I think you found her credible too but in addition to that-- CARLSON: I don't know I didn't - she didn't answer any questions. HAHN: --he lied about little things. He lied about what the Renata Alumni was. He lied about what the Ralph Club was. He lied to Congress. He cannot-- CARLSON: Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're saying-- HAHN: --be on the Supreme Court. CARLSON: --he lied about the Ralph Club? Over. Done. I agree. HAHN: And the Renata Alumni Club -- CARLSON: And so look, you lie about the Ralph Club and you're done. HAHN: --and what it meant. CARLSON: I feel that in my heart. Let me just say. This is so crazy. HAHN: Look, you got to be-- CARLSON: I'm saving this tape. HAHN: --truthful. CARLSON: All right. OK. HAHN: You got why lie about it though, my - my thing - my thing, Tyler - my thing, Tucker-- CARLSON: Especially about the Ralph Club, I agree. HAHN: --is why lie about-- CARLSON: OK. HAHN: --that? It was something he could have just said I was a dumb kid and I did-- CARLSON: I'll let you-- HAHN: --you know, we caught we Ralph when we drank-- CARLSON: --I'm going to let you over the last word-- HAHN: --well it was just a beer prank he could have just said that. Instead, he lied. CARLSON: OK. With the last word on the Ralph Club, Chris Hahn, thank you very much. This is a Fox News alert: We promised to monitor the ongoing Trump rally, Mississippi for some news and we have some. The President advised the Brett Kavanaugh - addressed rather the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation about five minutes ago. He spoke about Christine Ford, NBC and the creepy porn lawyer at the center of a lot of this. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: How did you get home? I don't remember. How'd you get there? I don't remember. Where is the place? I don't remember. How many years ago was it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What neighborhood was it? And I don't know. Where's the house? I don't know. Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know. But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember. And a man's life is in tatters, a man's life is shattered. We had another woman just reported by a sleazebag lawyer named Avenatti. Sleazebag! Sleazebag! We have - well it turned out even NBC who's as bad as they get, even NBC couldn't shield her with that interview. Did you see that interview? This woman had no clue what was going on. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: That was the President just minutes ago. We'll continue to monitor the rally if more news emerges. And we'll have an update on that Georgetown professor, Christine Fair, who says people with a certain skin color should be murdered, castrated, and fed to annals but it's cool because free speech. The only person guaranteed free speech on campus is calling for killing over at Georgetown. We've got details. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Georgetown University professor Christine Fair is a lunatic and a hater but she's become the face of the Trump resistance. In response to the Kavanaugh hearings fear tweet - Fair rather tweeted that White men on the Senate Judiciary Committee should be killed. They should be castrated and their bodies fed to pigs. Not making that up. Read the tweet. It's on the screen. Georgetown University was asked about this. They didn't care. She apparently is the only person at Georgetown with free speech rights. Twitter has suspended her account briefly. Asra Nomani is a former Georgetown professor. Fair once publicly denounced her as a Nazi enabler for voting for Donald Trump. Asra Nomani joins us tonight. What do you make of this? Were you surprise - I've never really seen anything like this. These aren't political opinions. They're - they're a summons to violence and mutilation. Were you surprised? ASRA NOMANI, FORMER GEORGETOWN PROFESSOR: Well I've long known for last two years since Election Day 2016 that she was, you know, part of this extremist Left that sadly has found new power in America. I confronted her on her own smears against me. And she felt like she had a self-righteous indignation that she was allowed to express all of this. What is particularly disturbing about her latest attack is that she's an expert on South Asia. And she knows that this is exactly what the Afghan Taliban did to a former President of Afghanistan named Najibullah. They castrated him. They hung him so that they could terrorize the people of Afghanistan. And so, for me, what she is tweeting is not just a simple, single, you know, troubling remark, but part of this larger dynamic that we face over the last two years that I consider it an extremist alt-Left insurgency in America that is trying to topple this government with any means necessary. And we see it from this bird-dogging, you know, strategy that they've got, cornering senators and congressmen in the elevators-- CARLSON: Right. NOMANI: --this has been two years in the making. And I didn't get to hear your earlier segment. But all of the players here are the same ones that marched on the day after President Trump's inauguration. They were all funded by the Open Society Foundation, as you mentioned, by billionaire George Soros who, unfortunately, couldn't get his candidate, Hillary Clinton, into office. And so, for the last two years they have been empowered time and time again to try to topple our government and - by any means necessary and this is disturbing. CARLSON: So, you're describing an activist group using radical means to achieve political ends. I buy that completely. What baffles me is why long-standing institutions like Georgetown University, which has a lot of alumni and reasonable people who work there or The Washington Post, which wrote a piece defending Professor Fair tonight, why are they defending-- NOMANI: Well-- CARLSON: --calls to violence all of a sudden? NOMANI: Yes. It's unbelievable. I mean it's this double standard that anybody who agrees with you and is inside your tribe is OK, no matter what they say. But if somebody is outside your tribe then they are fair game to take down. And so, you know, last week, I was here at the Capitol from midnight to try to get a seat at the hearing because I wanted to decide for myself what was - who was telling the truth-- CARLSON: Yes. NOMANI: --what - what was the reality? Well I was number three in line. And, you know, I couldn't get a seat because they had all been given away. CARLSON: Yes. NOMANI: One of which was given to the actress, you know, that was sitting behind Judge Kavanaugh. What we face today are people who are going into these hearing rooms, people who are going into our democracy with not the idea of civil society that we had always hoped would run our country, but an insurgency. And that is so disturbing to me-- CARLSON: Yes. NOMANI: --and distressing. CARLSON: Ooh, your words are - are distressing to me because I know they are true. Professor, thanks a lot for joining us tonight. Appreciate it. I hope you'll come back. NOMANI: Absolutely. Thank you so much for taking the time to try to bring people into balance. CARLSON: Of course, we are for balance. NOMANI: Yes. CARLSON: Victor Davis Hanson is one of the smartest people we know. He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and he joins us tonight. You're one of the few guests I would just ask what's your assessment of what is happening right now tonight? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HISTORIAN: Well I think that with all these incidents of professors saying certain things and asymmetrical treatment toward them, we're starting to see that if you're conservative and you are zealous in expression about the Kavanaugh hearings, it's a window into your dark soul. If you're progressive, it's proof of your zealousness for right and righteous indignation. But it - it's illustrative, Tucker, that the values of the campus are no longer esoteric or irrelevant. They've been transmogrified right into the Congress-- CARLSON: Exactly. HANSON: --right into the - the heart of American governance. We saw at Yale or Berkeley, students rushed professor Christakis at Yale but now we're seeing the same thing with Jeff Flake. Lindsey Graham said he felt it was dangerous to walk to the Senate. And we're starting to see Cory Booker - Booker, I couldn't believe it, he said \"I believe your truth,\" to Dr. Ford. And I thought, wait a minute, there is one truth that we find through cross-examination, witnesses testimonies. They're not just equal narratives but that's exactly what the university preaches in post-modern English department that there's a variety of truths and you can pick which one you want and they become valid depending on access to power, race, class, or gender. We still have and we have the same idea of prolonged adolescence where we have these 18, 19, and 20 year olds that we invent things like micro- aggressions, trigger warnings, safe space so they won't be hurt. These are people whose great-grandfathers were dying in places like Guadalcanal and Okinawa at 18. And yet, now in the Congress, we're not supposed to be too aggressive in cross examination or we don't want to pursue certain lines of examination because we - we've confused the entire idea of being sincere with being credible. Dr. Ford was sincere and she was empathetic. But that did not translate into being credible. Credibility is established by evidence, cross- examination, testimony, and the messy process of cross-examination. And it's not - it's not established by accusing, considering the accused guilty or relying on hearsay or not knowing any of the key details that might adjudicate who is telling the truth or not. So, the campus is in the Congress and that's a scary idea. CARLSON: So, let me just ask very quickly, this is almost a rhetorical question, but conservatives have fought for 40 years to lower the marginal tax rates. I think that's a virtuous thing to work toward. But they spent almost no time at all trying to reclaim college campuses for education. Should they have? HANSON: Yes. I think they should have. I think that when they give money, and a lot of very wealthy people give money to the universities, they should target that - that donation. The worst thing you can do is throw gasoline onto them fire by getting your name on a building and not knowing how your money is going to be spent. CARLSON: Yes. HANSON: We got - we need to look at a lot of medieval practices from tenure to the admissions processes, which are not transparent. And it's a protected - it's a protected institution. It's time that we-- CARLSON: Exactly. HANSON: --put a little light on and see if it's - if it follows the practices of due process. CARLSON: It's time to nail 95 theses to the front door of Harvard. I totally agree with that. Professor, thank you-- HANSON: Yes. CARLSON: --very much. HANSON: Thank you. Thank you. CARLSON: Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana says that he is fed up with what he sees as a witch-hunt against Brett Kavanaugh. He joins us next to explain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, R-LA.: This entire thing makes me want to heave. If you think this is about searching for the truth, you ought to put down the bong. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Because self-awareness, as a category, has totally disappeared from the earth, like the dinosaurs, this happened today. America's best- known dismisser of sexual misconduct allegations weighed in, of course, on the Brett Kavanaugh saga to remind us we need to believe all women. While appearing at the Atlantic Festival, Hillary Clinton said that now that the allegations are less credible, and don't involve her husband, she's OK with just believing accusers and ditching the account of anyone else. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON: --women, and young women and girls, are saying you have to hear our stories too. They've been historically dismissed, condescended to-- --picked apart, second guessed, held to a double standard, and at some point it just is time to say, enough. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Though there's a guy who says he's a journalist sitting next to her, you can be certain that no meaningful follow-up questions were asked, of course. Hillary Clinton also went on to say that Kavanaugh became too angry after being accused of gang-rape and, therefore, he shouldn't sit on the Supreme Court. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON: I mean, really? I thought it was just part of the whole of his very defensive and, un - you know, unconvincing presentation. But I think for anyone who believes there's such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges, particularly those on our highest court, to approach issues, approach plaintiffs and defendants, with a sense of fairness, that there's a lot to be concerned about. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: I mean it's just it's totally Orwellian. But again, nobody noted that as she spoke. Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana though noticed it. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENNEDY: This entire thing makes me want to heave. If you think this is about searching for the truth, you ought to put down the bong. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Senator Kennedy joins us tonight. Put down the bong. Do you think that there are people in the United States Senate, any people, who believe that this is on the level and that Democrats are acting in good faith as they were - asked for this investigation? KENNEDY: I think there are some Democrats in good faith. But I - I think some of - of their colleagues it isn't about searching for the truth. It's about winning. Just win baby, win-- CARLSON: Yes. KENNEDY: --doesn't matter who gets destroyed. And the - these are people, I'm not going to name names, but I'm not sure they have a soul. I don't think their mother breastfed them. I think they went right to raw meat. If Dr. Ford's in the way, destroy her. Breach her confidentiality. Destroy your kids. Destroy her family. Brett Kavanaugh's in the way? Destroy him and his kids and his reputation. And then, after calling him a rich, drunk, lying, sexual predator, they criticized him for defending himself. Now, having said that, I'm a - I'm a lot more sanguine than some folks around here. I know the Democrats think they're winning. But, you know, sometimes falling feels like you're flying for a little while. I predict that Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed. They think he's a smoked turkey. You watch. I think he'll be confirmed. And I think he'll be confirmed within the next week. CARLSON: Do - are you alone in thinking that? KENNEDY: I think there's some who doubt that we're winning. I'm not one of them. I also think that the American people despite the fact that many in Washington D.C. believe they're much smarter than - than - than Americans, I think - I think the American people, most mainstream Americans, see right through this. And I - and I hope - I hope they're motivated enough to go vote. It's not going to change. CARLSON: Right. KENNEDY: You - you can't fix stupid. But you can vote it out. CARLSON: So - I - this is a complex topic. But I - I want your crisp summation of it because I think it's important. So, you've introduced a new bill into Congress that targets banks that infringe on gun rights. Can you sum that up for our viewers? KENNEDY: Yes. My bill would say that the General Services - Services Administration cannot do business on behalf of the American taxpayer with any bank that describes - decides to discriminate - to discriminate against a lawful business on the basis of social policy. For example, Citigroup and Bank of America don't believe in the Second Amendment. And they've decided they won't do business with any - with any businesses that - that sell automatic weapons, semi-automatic weapons or handguns. Now, my cup - their copy of the Bill of Rights goes from one to three. My copy includes the Second Amendment. And when they almost went broke in 2008 and the American taxpayer had to give Citigroup $475 billion and Bank of America $336 billion, I don't recall Citigroup or Bank of America saying \"Well now wait, which of you believe in the Second Amendment? I don't want your money.\" CARLSON: Yes. KENNEDY: They took everybody's money. So, we don't need red banks or blue banks. We need safe banks. And I have a feeling that they - they have - if they think they have too much time on their hands so they need to make social policy instead of Congress, then - then maybe they ought to look at their balance sheets. CARLSON: It's hard to state how wonderful I - I - I think that is and how glad I am to hear it, finally, somebody. Senator, thanks so much. We're going to be watching that for sure. KENNEDY: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Great to see you. KENNEDY: You too. CARLSON: We've got a little bit of news right after the break. We hope you will stick with us till then. We'll be right back. TEXT: TUCKER'S BOOK IS OUT TODAY. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: We've told you a lot about Amazon on this program, in particular, how Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man has kept many of his workers in poverty. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Nearly one in three Amazon employees in Arizona, for example, was on food stamps last year. Taxpayers shouldn't be making up the difference for the employees of the single richest man in the world. I find it disgusting and wrong and actually incomprehensible that he would have people working for him that are so poor, I'm paying for their food stamps. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Well it is disgusting and wrong and incomprehensible so much so that Amazon didn't even defend itself because there was no doing that. They instead responded today. To our surprise, the company announced that all its employees, whether full-time or part-time or seasonal, will now receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, that's double the federal minimum wage. In a statement, Bezos said, \"We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and then decided we wanted to lead.\" Well Amazon still constitutes one of the most dangerous concentrations of power in the world. We're still concerned about that. But they did the right thing here for whatever reason. At the very least, they still care about public relations, so that's a way. What do you do about the craziness enveloping your world where you can vote but you could also understand why it's happening, Ship of Fools, my book out today explains the whole story. Pick it up. See you tomorrow. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS: All right, Tucker, thank you. Congrats on the book, by the way. CARLSON: Thank you, Sean. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

MARK LEVIN, HOST: Hello, America. I am Mark Levin. This is \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" We have a great guest, Governor Matt Bevin from Kentucky. How are you sir? GOV. MATT BEVIN, R-KY.: It's a pleasure to be with you. I'm doing well, thank you. LEVIN: Thank you. You know, you are uniquely qualified to talk about this upcoming election given your background. And I want to talk very briefly about your background and then we'll jump right in. First off, the first office you've ever held is governor of Kentucky. BEVIN: That's correct. LEVIN: The first office the President has ever held is President of the United States. BEVIN: He aimed a little higher and I'm glad he did.. LEVIN: Aimed a little higher, but I want to get into this with you in just moment. You were elected the 62nd governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 2015. There haven't been many Republican governors of Kentucky, have there in modern times? BEVIN: No, I may be like the fourth or so in the last hundred years. We don't do this very often, that's true. LEVIN: No, you grew up with family, lived in an old farmhouse in dirt poor, based on what I read. BEVIN: We were financially humble. That is certainly below the poverty level. LEVIN: You grew up on a farm, you raised crops and livestock and you had parents who instilled in you -- family and faith. You attended Washington and Lee University in Virginia later on an ROTC scholarship. Upon graduation, active duty in the United States Army as an officer. You left the service having achieved the rank of Captain. And you founded several companies in Kentucky. You invested in a number of others in the Commonwealth as well as in other states and I want to talk about this election. I think it's very, very important and I want to circle back to your own experience in how you became governor. It wasn't so simple, it's not a straight line in a tough state. They keep talking about this blue wave and some of the early indications are there is going to be or maybe some kind of blue wave. You are a man of government, you're a man of history, you're a man of politics. What do you see happening here? BEVIN: I am a student of history. I've always pride - I grew up in a home with no television so we did read a lot and I've always been intellectually curious about a variety of things. And I tend to look at statistics and they seem to stick in my head and I do know this, that in modern times, they've only been twice when there was not a midterm shift in power. And so, it is the norm. It would be unusual if the Democrats did not take control of the House. In fact, the average has been 31 seats in each of the midterm elections that have changed parties. The Republicans have a 24-seat lead, I believe, which would imply that they would be seven seats down. Statistically, historically it's a given that they will lose the House. But there have been two times when that did not happen. I truly do believe this will be the third time. We are in - the paradigm has shifted a bit. We are in a different time and people - for all of the narrative that we get in what passes for mainstream media and I say that not pejoratively, but just that's what they would call themselves, traditional media, would have us believe that A, this person who is now the President, Donald Trump, is not even really the President, shouldn't have been, had no chance, does not deserve to be there is one step away from being impeached. All of the things - this narrative that they would have us believe is not really connected to what the American people believe or he wouldn't have gotten 307 electoral votes. The whole point being that I think there is an appetite for what he's been doing that is not evident based on polling or what people are saying or what yard signs or bumper stickers are out there just as it is not evident in 2060. I think this will be the third time. Will the Republicans lose seats? Yes they will. It will be shocking if they did not. In fact, they will lose seats. Will they lose 31? I don't believe so. Will they lose even 25? I don't believe so. We will see. I mean, the voters will decide. Every district is different. But the level of resentment that is held by a handful is not widespread among the people and I truly believe that people are grateful for the President, his willingness to shake things up, his willingness to deliver on promises that he made. He is doing - and people may or may not like the methodology, but you can't argue with the results. He is somebody who is executing like very few people that have preceded him in terms of what he ran on and that's a refreshing change of pace for Americans. LEVIN: These news reports talk about how the Democrat base is all fired up and how the Republican base is relatively passive. I'm starting to see a change in this that there is potential backlash that the media are really so one-sided, so over-the-top that the Democrats whether it's hearings or whatever is taking place, the attacks on Ted Cruz and other conservatives and Republicans who serve in the administration at restaurants and so forth, you really think there's this relatively silent majority, so-called, that's out there that is going to show up in the midterm election? BEVIN: There is no way I would be the governor. There is no way that President Trump would be the President if that majority did not exist. It wouldn't be possible because I didn't have the support of the party or of the powers that be or of any particular political establishment nor did he. In fact, I was at a more microcosmic level in Kentucky, a shock to the system in ways that unnerved people because who was I? I was somebody who didn't - I hadn't kissed the right rings or backsides or waited in line or whatever the case might be and he's done the same thing. But America is hungry for this. Americans are not the fools that the media and so many in the political ranks would have us believe that we are. And that is the greatness of America. Is that people are, at the end of the day, not easily fooled. And I truly believe that there is a hunger for a continuation of the path we are on which is America standing firmly for life and liberty and the things that this show is here to discuss. These are the foundational tenets upon which this nation was built. It's refreshing when we actually have a leader in Washington who believes this to his core. LEVIN: You mentioned the House of Representatives. How about the United States Senate? When you look at the map, the United States Senate, the Republicans should be winning a whole bunch of seats, sure. The Republicans in the Senate and the House, they haven't delivered on a lot of their promises. The President has. Spending is up, the debt is way up, but they've done good things. I mean with judges and so forth, but not an additional penny for the law that the President is trying very, very aggressively to get taken care of. How do you see the Senate in this election? BEVIN: I truly - I would be shocked if they did not pick up one or two seats. I mean, you are correct in a different environment, with a different sense of motivation and a different sense of urgency perhaps, but the reasons for why we're not getting those things, you could lay directional blame in any number of directions. We might pick up five, six or seven. Truthfully, with far more potential pickups than we have seats to defend as Republicans. I say this as a Republican. But I think we could pick up one or two pretty easily. I would be shocked if we didn't come out with 53 or 54 seats in the Senate. I really would. LEVIN: So what you're saying is on election night, on that first Tuesday night in November, we are going to be watching television or listening to the radio and the same people who were shocked at Donald Trump's victory are going to be shocked at what happens in the midterm election. BEVIN: I believe so. Because what happens is that it becomes this false narrative that for whatever reason has been predetermined in the minds of some and they try to will it into fruition by talking about it nonstop as if it's a foregone conclusion. Trying and it's interesting because within the insulated world in which people have these conversation, it all sounds good and nobody disagrees because they all want the same false narrative to come true, but out there in the heartland in places like Kentucky, people aren't reading \"The Washington Post.\" They are not reading \"The New York Times.\" They don't give a rip about what some prognosticator in Washington DC thinks about the political landscape. They don't. What they care about are the same things that they have always cared about. They care about the security of their families, the physical security and the financial security. They care about their wallet. They care about whether the money that they earn is able to be kept as much as possible by themselves and to the extent that it's not what the government does with it is actually useful and productive. These are simple things. We are simple people. We're not easily fooled as Americans. We are not idiots, but at the same time, we also want simple things in our lives. We want families to live in freedom and we want as little government in our lives as possible. I wear this button right here. It's a little pair of scissors cutting through red tape. It's an indication people on my team wear this. I pledged when I was elected I am going to cut 30% of all regulation in our state over three years and we are well on our way to doing it. And people who say, \"Hey, this is somehow going to compromise our safety, our security, our environment and what have you,\" Nonsense. Still 100,000-some rules telling us what we can or cannot do. Americans are fed up with this. Nobody wants a dirty environment or dirty air or unsafe streets or whatever the case might be, but they are increasingly less convinced that more government rules are the answer to give them liberty that innately they were created to crave and that we've been blessed in this nation like no people that have ever lived on this earth to have such an abundance that we can afford to take it for granted. It's my biggest fear. I was asked recently what the biggest threat to America was and I think it's our apathy. It is the fact you're so blessed that we can afford to not care. Think about that. We have it so good that we can afford to not care and we're convinced that our quality of life is not likely to change much. That's the beginning of the end. Every culture and civilization since the dawn of man has crumbled from within. Exterior wars - wars move nation's capitals. They move borders, but wars do not destroy cultures. Wars do not destroy civilizations. Those are destroyed from within due to complacency and due to apathy. LEVIN: Beyond the presidency, beyond this election, do you think were beginning to crumble from within? BEVIN: There s no doubt. I wrote a letter back some years ago to someone in the faith-based community and it was entitled \"Where are the Daniels?\" This was before I had ever thrown my hat into the political arena. This was somebody as an observer, as a father, as a veteran, as a husband, as a taxpaying employer of other people, somebody who was like so many of your viewers that are just out there living my life. I looked around at the landscape and I said \"What are we doing?' We've become numb. We have come - and again, it's not to pick on - I'm a big believer in term limits. I just am. Always have been. Nothing good comes from complacency in any one place whether it's a business, whether it's in government, whether it's in a church, pick the category, if people become too accustomed to any one thing for too long, it usually doesn't result in a better environment. And so to that end, I looked around and I said ,\"America is getting soft. The underbelly is getting soft.\" And did worry about this. I wrote this letter, I said, \"Where are the Daniels? Where the people from among us, normal people, that are willing to rise up and give some modern day equivalent of defiance to the king and say, this is not acceptable. This is not who we are. These are not the values that we hold.\" And so this has been something of concern to me for some time. I will say this, you often hear people in politics talk about how we are at some kind of a crossroads. I would beg to differ only in this respect. I think in recent years, and we saw it in 2016 and we are still there, it's more of a fork in the road. Crossroads implies a lot of options. A fork in the road, you go in one way or the other. And America is still, but has very much in recent years been at this fork in the road. And we were going to dog-like hard to the left in a way that may or may not have not ever been possible to return from or go to the right. LEVIN: When we come back home and ask you, what should all of these Republicans be running on? You are a conservative, you ran as a conservative. You fought through the primary system. You were elected governor of Kentucky. I think your advice during these times would be particularly useful. Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget, almost every weeknight you can join us over at the crtv.com, crtv.com and watch my show which is Levin TV. Just go to crtv.com/mark, crtv.com/mark or give us a call at 844-LEVIN-TV, 844- LEVIN-TV. We would love to have you over there and are growing conservative community. We'll be right back. LEVIN: Governor Matt Bevin, as we said, your first office you won was governor, that's the top office in the state for Commonwealth. Donald Trump runs for his first office, he becomes President of the United States. Why is that and what can candidates learn now? Should they be running scared? Should they walk into the fire? What should they do? BEVIN: I mean, I'll answer that question as it relates to candidates but I will speak to why I think it even happened in my case. I've always said, listen, when people look at those that are running for office, they should be less inclined to vote for those who desperately want to be a politically elected person, and rather try to find the candidate that's willing to be that person. And this is how I ran and I think the President did the very same thing. He did not want it as much as he was willing to do it. and Americans are hungry for that kind of sincerity from people and I mean that. I mean, there's so much fakery. There is so much posturing. When I ran, I was the only one in the race that was willing to put it in writing. Everything that I was going to do, I put out what it called a blueprint for a better Kentucky. There were seven tenets and they were all things that people said if you talk about those, let alone put them in writing you'll never ever win. Things like right to work. Things like school of choice. Things like cutting red tape. Things like modernizing the tax code. Things like tackling the underfunded pension system. All of these that had been ignored by people and were considered third rails, do not touch them. The President did in similar ways the very same thing, talking about things that people for generations and certainly, in recent years have wanted to be talked about, have talked about in quiet little circles amongst themselves. But the idea that somebody is willing to lead on these things, is a degree of boldness, some might see it. It's very unusual in the world of politics. And yet, people are hungry for it. It's not because everything that came out of my mouth, or his or others of the same approach is correct. It's not that the methodology is always perfect. It's not that any individual, myself or anyone else, has everything figured out. But I always would tell people, \"Listen, if you don't want me to fight for these things, don't vote for me.\" I've never been with people who would say, \"Well, in this group you may not talk about that.\" I would say, \"Why?\" I'm not going to change what I believe or what I'm going to fight for in order to accommodate somebody. I am not going to pretend to be something I'm not in order to get a vote. It's that kind fakery that people are fed up with. And everything has become so contrived with consultants. One thing I will share with you and it's at the heart of your question, what should candidates do? Whether they do or don't do what I am about to say is up to them. I've never paid one cent for a poll in my life, ever - not when I was a candidate, not since I've been governor. At the end of the day, speak the truth, tell people what you're going to do. Don't waver from it. Be bold in your conviction. Don't talk about things you don't know about. Talk with passion about the things you do know about. And if you are willing to be that person, people will engage. And if they don't, you should not be the person representing them. And so to me, it's a simple approach. Shoot straight with people. Be honest. I've never ever had a speechwriter. I don't write anything out. I'd given hour and a half - at my inauguration speech, my state of the commonwealth addresses, I just talk to people. In a similar way that we are having this conversation. I will tell you this, Mark. I love America. And my reason for doing this is I love America. It does concern me. LEVIN: Your are jittering up. BEVIN: I'll tell you what, it is emotional to me. Because the concern that I have nine children, you mentioned, I concerns me that we are throwing away this noble experiment. That this greatness, one and a half million people have died in uniform, 1.5 million since this nation's inception and we have it so good that we do not care. This is what concerns me. And so for me, I want people to serve in public office who love this country. The reason I respect the President, among others is that he genuinely loves America. He loves America. And he would fight to the end for America and he is doing it. The vitriol, the scorn, the ridicule from people who aren't even worthy of carrying his water that he takes day in and day out, the mindless drivel that passes for enlightenment from people is remarkable because it's nonstop. I've never seen anything like it. But while he's only a third generation American, he fights like somebody who is a first generation American. My mother's father and all of her grandparents all came to Ellis Island. There is something about people who come recently to this country and the passion that they have for it, an appreciation for what liberty really is because they've come from somewhere where it isn't. And their willingness to fight for that to preserve it for their children and their children's children is powerful. It is the greatness of America and we were losing that and we still are in some measure, but this is a President who fights for that. This is what I've been trying to fight for. What I'm trying to do is encourage one, three, five, ten, fifty other people who will in turn inspire similar amounts of people so that perhaps a generation from now, when we need the next Abraham Lincoln, that that young person will have been inspired during this period in time because somebody was willing to step up and be hammered down. And I will tell you what, America is worth it. I will say this and your viewers probably would imagine this, but the political world is more squarely and surly and nasty than the even imagine it to be. It is more thankless. It is more of a cesspool than I wished it were. It is more bureaucratic and more mindless and more emotionally driven and less logically driven than they would even imagine it to be. And yet, somebody is going to do it. So why should the somebody not be so somebody who shares the values we have. Someone is going to make the rules. LEVIN: So have integrity. Speak the truth. Explain the problems the country faces. Have some potential solutions and some arguments for them. Get off all the drivel. Get off all the nonsense and yet, it is difficult in some ways, isn't it? Because we are bombarded with us day in and day out. You watch CNN, you watch MSNBC. You read \"The New York Times\" and these other things. It is day in and day out, day in and day out looking for little things to attack somebody or breaking down the President's tweets syllable by syllable so it really takes unique human beings to rise above that and run for public office. And you are saying that is what we must do. BEVIN: There's a certain thickness of skin that is required, but it helps to have come from a certain background. I am blessed to be a compilation of my life experiences. I did grow up below the poverty level in a humble way, but I have served in the military. I've come up through a hard knock world as some would describe it, but I am blessed by that. It's made me strong. It's made me resilient. I have buried my oldest child. That changes you. That affects your life in ways that I couldn't even begin to articulate. All of these life experiences allow a person to either learn from that and do for others. One of the greatest - or not or to be selfish and insular. One of the best pieces of advice I ever got, I was 17 years old and my mother, we were by this little wood stove. We had no central heat in our house, a little wood stove. It was the winter. I was cold. I was standing right by this stove my mother said, \"All you kids are different.\" I was the second of six. She said, \"You're all going to grow up and do different things, have different abilities. You're going to pursue different things in life.\" She said, \"Just make sure whatever you do, your father and I don't care what it is that you do exactly, just make sure that at the end of every day, you give back more than you take.\" How blessed I was to have been raised by a mother like that and a father like that who taught us to serve other people above ourselves. That's what our founding fathers did. That's why George Washington asked when asked to be President, \"Have I not done enough for my country? There is not a person in America, with all due respect to you, to myself, to the President, there is not one person in America that could say with a straight face, have I not done enough for my country? LEVIN: We will be right back. LAUREN GREEN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Lauren Green. Canada and the United States just reaching a deal that will preserve the three-country NAFTA trade pact. The agreement will allow greater US access to Canada's dairy market and address Canadian concerns about potential auto tariffs. Negotiators were racing to meet a US imposed September 30th deadline. Tomorrow will be one year since the worst mass shooting in modern US history. Fifty eight people were killed and hundreds of other were injured on October 1st of last year when a gunman opened fire on a crowds for a music festival in Las Vegas. Tomorrow, the bright marquees on the strip will go dark in honor of the victims. It's just one of several remembrances planned including a blood drive, a candlelight vigil and sunrise service that would include a 58-second moment of silence. I'm Lauren Green now back to \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" LEVIN: Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky, you've had an interesting road to the governorship and I think it could be illustrative to people who are running now and illustrative to people out there who are saying, but what can I do? Maybe I want to run for office, too. You were one of those people. Give us a synopsis of how this happened? BEVIN: Sure. There's a long story and a short story. LEVIN: Give me the in-between story. BEVIN: It is the fact that as I alluded to earlier. I looked across the landscape and realize there need to be men and women of conviction, men and women of honor, men and women of integrity who are not owned, pre-owned before they even get into elected office by some constituency or some interest group or somebody who groomed them or anointed them, who will actually be in public office and make decisions. That there needs to be a return to a belief in and a recognition of and a utilization of, of and by and for the people. That of and by and for the people is a real thing. That it really truly only works if the people take advantage of it, if the people are engaged. And we have become sort of lost in a political malaise. LEVIN: You were motivated by things like the Declaration of Independence. BEVIN: Of all the crazy things, and think about this. This about our founders who pledged their lives, fortunes and sacred honor. That was not a bumper sticker. That was not a campaign slogan. They literally gave their lives, fortunes and sacred honor knowing that if in fact they were to lose, they would lose everything including their lives. And some of them did. And yet, they did it anyway. Where are those people from among our own ranks? And so my path to this was not only to try to be what I was not seeing on the political front, to try to be an inspiration knowing that with my limitations and shortcomings that there is somebody far better than me and many bodies far better than me that could and should run and what if I could inspire them to do it by showing that a normal person can step up, take all of these things and arrows, take all the abuse, weather on through it and prove that things can be done. LEVIN: And you announced that you are going to run and you take on the most powerful man probably in politics at the time - the Senate Republican leader, and you took a lot of slings and arrows and millions of dollars are spent to rewrite your history and to change who you are and you didn't have the funds to counter it, tell us a little bit about that. BEVIN: Again the first time - this is my second time I ran for office was to run for governor and the first time I did run for US Senate, I ran against the then Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, I had always voted for him. I voted for him that year in the general election because relative to the alternative, he was the better choice. I do believe in the importance of voting. I don't think people should settle per se, but you should chose the best choice out there. But I didn't vote for him when I ran against him. I voted for myself, I'll be pretty clear about that. And the reality is, is that the system needed to be shaken. It was not anything personal at all about him, not even a little bit. But the system itself had took on - think about this. When our founders started this country, they looked at the forms of government including the ones they had most recently come from and what did they intentionally do? They embraced the House of Commons concept and rejected the House of Lords. They intentionally did not re-create that. and I say with all due respect to those who have spent their entire lives in Washington DC, we've created a modern-day incarnation of the House of Lords in the form of career politicians. We have in both parties, of all ideologies and this idea that somehow people are entitled to their seat once they have it for as long as they live and that they get to self-select and self-propagate and choose the next people that would follow them is an insult to the American people. LEVIN: But you lost ... BEVIN: I did. LEVIN: But you had a big showing and starkly, you had a good showing. BEVIN: We've got people to think and to talk. LEVIN: And then you said okay, I'm not done. What did you do next? BEVIN: I really wasn't planning to run again. My intent had been to rock the boat and to wake people up, to shake people from their apathy. But when I did run for governor, there were three Republicans that were already in the race, they were all good men. I knew them all. I would have voted for anyone over them over the two-term Attorney General who was going to be the likely nominee and indeed was the nominee from the other side, but I waited - I went to the first Lincoln Day Dinner. I heard all three speak and to make the long story short, I realized I thought we needed somebody to really make hard decisions. LEVIN: So who won? BEVIN: Two hours before the filing deadline, I filed. LEVIN: You filed and ... BEVIN: Not one elected Republican during the entire primary, not one elected Republican in the entire state supported me or endorsed me. I won by four ten thousands of 1%. LEVIN: Closest votes. BEVIN: Eighty-three votes in a statewide election. God has an amazing sense of humor. I will tell you, Mark. He really does. LEVIN: And you won on the general election. BEVIN: The general election. LEVIN: Which they also didn't think you could win. BEVIN: They said I had no chance. I was never in a margin of error for any poll that was ever done, which is why I don't put much stock in polls. None of them were done by me, they were done by other people. I was down by 5% or more in every election. I won by 9%, - more than 9%, it wasn't even close. So I mean, my point is this, I didn't go from being five down to up nine in three days. The reality is, it goes back to that silent majority we were talking about. They do exist. They don't bumper stickers on or yard sign and sign out, but they vote because they care about their family, they care about America, they care about the future. LEVIN: Now, this is a very, very inspirational story because you were elected in 2013, that's not that long ago. People are running out there now, members of the House, members of the Senate, Republicans who are freshly running in open seats or against incumbent Democrats. They can keep in mind your experience, I think that's very, very important. Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget almost every weeknight you can watch Levin TV, Levin TV and see me there and join our great conservative community. Here's how you do it, go to crtv.com/mark, crtv.com/mark or give us a call at 844-LEVIN-TV, 844-LEVIN- TV. We'll be right back. LEVIN: Governor, let's get very specific here. What do you think two, three, four, most important issues are that governments at all levels should be addressing, candidates should addressing and the American people need to be alerted to? BEVIN: There are several things. One I've alluded to earlier, I won't go into again in great detail. Cutting that regulation. We make it so difficult for a young entrepreneur or a newly arrived American or even somebody who's been here for years to be able to pursue the American dream as we have historically known it to exist. The suffocation of overregulation and bureaucracy is destroying the innovative spirit that has made us unique among nations for generations. That's one thing. Number two, the amount of debt that we are piling on this nation is criminal frankly. Because there is no chance that it is ever going to be repaid. Both parties are doing it. We've just most recently - this latest budget that was passed was an absolute insult and truth be told, was not the proudest moment of a Republican run administration and Congress. It just was not. We owe better than that to the next generations. $21 trillion and counting, that fact that anybody still buys our debt under the apparent assumption that we are going to pay them back is remarkable to me, and the only reason we can play this game and we see what's happening right now in countries like Venezuela, we saw what happened in places like Zimbabwe, we saw what happened in other places around the world over the years ... LEVIN: Greece, I mean ... BEVIN: Greece and all these places - what happens is that eventually, the piper must be paid. We are the world's reserve currency. So we get to print it and people still buy it and we still dilute then the value of the money that has been saved and we haven't yet paid that piper, but the piper is going to get paid. Heaven help us if America is no longer the world's reserve currency and we can't print it at will. That's another topic that has got to be addressed with a sense of earnestness and seriousness because yes, you can kick it down the road for your political career, but shame on any man or woman who steps into political office and is not worried about what they are doing to the people that will follow them. The other thing, too is the absolute crisis that is brewing in our pension systems. As surely as we're having this conversation, the pension systems - the public pension systems in America are going to collapse in the next five, ten or 15 years. They are. It's coming and people say, well there's no chapter in Bankruptcy Code for a state to declare bankruptcy. There isn't. But that does not mean they are not going to go bankrupt. That doesn't mean they are not going to become insolvent. Kentucky has the worst funded pension system of any in America, Illinois and New Jersey and Connecticut, California. Others are down there at the bottom of the pile. This is not a place any of us would aspire to be. The PBGC, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. in the private sector, steps in and seizes a plan when it's considered to be in crisis at the risk of insolvency, they step in when the plan gets to 80% funded or less. They seize that plan. They pay it out maybe 15 cents on the dollar and that is the end of it. There are very few public pension plans in America and in Kentucky, there is not a single one that's even close to 80% funded. Our largest in which hundreds of thousands of people are under the impression they are going to continue to get a pension benefit is 16% funded. And I'm being being fought by people in my own party and outside might party and the media to try to save a system. I'm trying to meet the obligation, doing something that's never been done. The reality is, I've put billions and billions of dollars and at the expense of other things to try to shore up and preserve a system where promises were made, actuarial assumptions were not accurate. We've assumed rates have returned. We've made promises with nobody funding those promises and the gig is about to be up. In America, this is probably somewhere between five and ten trillion dollar problem of unfunded liability depending on which assumptions you use or what you assume the market will produce. These are issues that people in elected office have got to take seriously. Because the greatest threat to our nation in addition to her apathy is our financial insolvency. If we can't - look, I don't mean to pick on a country, but Spain - the Spanish Armada, they once ruled the seas of the world. They had battleships in their harbors literally rusting because they can't even afford to maintain them or take them out. If we think it can't happen to us in America - how arrogant, how delusional, how disregarding of history are we if we don't think these things could happen to us. We've got to be serious about this. LEVIN: What's amazing is it is never discussed in the media. It's never discussed despite all the panels, despite all the guests, despite all the hosts, despite all of the 24/7 programming, it's never discussed. We'll be right back. Governor Bevin, let's say you're wrong and there is this huge blue wave and they take the house, big numbers, they chip away at the Senate. They've already told us about impeachment, these massive investigations, I mean, the country is really going to go through some kind of hell, is it not? BEVIN: It would be chaotic. There is no question about it and to the detriment not only to the whole political system, and of the sanity of your average person who pays attention to that but frankly, the entire foundations of this nation. It really would be. It would be very, very detrimental to our way of life. LEVIN: And here's the thing, despite all the attacks on the President, look at the economy. The economy is chugging along beautifully, people are getting jobs, unemployment in all facets of our economy, all races, all genders - way down and regulations that you talked about, entrepreneur can develop their products and market them. Look at our foreign policy. Look at what he's done with Israel. Look at what he's done with Iran and North Korea. Look at what he's doing with China and Russia. If the Democrats have this new massive sweep and they try to take out the President of the United States because they are furious that he dared to win in 2016, I think our enemies are going to be thrilled. I think they are going to be emboldened. I actually think this could be dangerous. BEVIN: There is no question about it and here is the important thing for people to understand without beating the apathy drum. Again, the greatest danger is that people who love America, who value the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, who do believe in the Constitutional principles upon which we are founded, if they sit at home, if they don't get engaged and I would encourage your listeners to not just themselves, but to find one, three, five, ten, 50 and a hundred people, use social media it's a powerful tool, use word-of-mouth, talk to people at church, talk to people at work, talk to people wherever you happen to go and spend your time and encourage them to get out and vote and to vote their values and not their party. This is an important thing for people to understand. The values we're talking about are shared by people of all political stripes. This is not a time to be partisan. This is not a time to think about what is in your party's best interest, but think about which values this nation was built on, which values matter to you as an individual, to a community and to us as a nation and to vote those values and not your party. LEVIN: Can you also imagine what would happen to our courts? To the Supreme Court? Can you imagine if this President can't put his imprint on the courts the way Obama did which was massive ideological change in the circuit court and so forth. We seem to be in a position that a if Republican or Donald Trump wins and the Republicans take the House and Senate, it is intolerable because the trajectory is to centralize all- powerful progressive government. And so they're trying to undo the election. They talk about impeaching Kavanaugh. They talk about impeaching Clarence Thomas. They talk about impeaching the President of the United States. Have you heard talk like this before? BEVIN: No, I mean, literally this is what the East refer to as sedition. And the reality is this, it's the last recourse for small minds. When they cannot be apologists for their own line of thinking, they run to the courts and they try to find people who will paint people in little corners. It is the hobgoblin of little minds is this kind of behavior, it really is. LEVIN: We'll be right back. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky. I'm going to ask you a question I ask a lot of guests here. Where do you see this nation in five to ten years. BEVIN: It depend on us. It depends on the people. It depends on the electorate. Winston Churchill was often referred to as the lion of England. And he, while he wasn't a humble man didn't particularly like that moniker and he once duly noted, he said, \"I am not the lion.\" He said, the people of England are the lions. He said, \"The history has called upon me to deliver the roar.\" We are at a similar point in our nation's history. And the question is, for your viewers and for the voters and for the people of America, are we prepared and are we willing to step up? Are we willing in each of our own respective ways to deliver the roar? Are we ready to do it? Are we willing to do it? It may not be easy. It may not be fun. That's what's going to determine the trajectory of America. It really is. If this is a gift, this noble experiment we have been given at great sacrifice, this freedom that we talk about as you know was paid for by those we talked about earlier. What are we going to do with this gift? Are we going to squander it? LEVIN: And we are running out of time ... BEVIN: We are running out of time, I'll tell you what, because we have it so good. And this is why I encourage people, talk to your children, vote your values, be engaged. It matters. LEVIN: It's been a pleasure. BEVIN: Thank you. LEVIN: Governor, thanks so much. BEVIN: You too.

            "article_content": "The latest Fox News poll shows Rep. Sinema (D) with a slight 47-45 lead over Rep. McSally (R) among likely voters. PHOENIX \u2013 In Arizona\u2019s highly contested Senate race, it could all come down to independent voters to decide who will be the next senator. \u201cIndependent\u00a0voters may have a very large say on who serves in Arizona for the U.S. Senate in the next race,\u201d said Joseph Garcia, Arizona State University Morrison Institute Public Policy professor. That\u2019s because the two candidates, Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., and Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.,\u00a0are virtually neck-and-neck in polls. In a Fox News poll among likely voters, Sinema is leading 47 percent to McSally\u2019s 45 percent. Rep. McSally touring a construction crane facility a week ahead of early voting. (Fox News) \u201cThis [race] is open because Sen. Jeff Flake decided to not seek re-election, which opened it up. But there's no guarantee that that will be a Republican, by any means,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cYou know,\u00a0the Democratic candidate\u00a0has a very strong campaign. So\u2026this race is up for grabs.\u201d Early voting begins next week so both campaigns are in their final stretch to try and win those independent and undecided votes, with the Sinema team looking to shift the balance in the Senate and the McSally team fighting to keep the seat Republican. \"About 70 percent will vote early so we're down to the final stretch,\u201d McSally said.\u00a0\u201cThis is a dead heat and it's consequential because the balance of the Senate majority goes through Arizona. The left knows that, which is why they're pouring millions of dollars into my opponent\u00a0trying to prop her up and turn her into something that she is not. \u201c Arizona Republican Party chairman, Jonathan Lines, said the party is \u201centhusiastic\u201d about where McSally stands right now. \u201cI often get calls from other chairmen nationwide\u2014they know how important it is\u2014Arizona is ground zero,\u201d Lines said. \u201cWe will keep this seat\u2026we're going to retain the Senate seat\u2026Martha McSally is doing remarkably well.\u201d But Sinema said she feels good about her campaign. Rep. Sinema meeting with students at one of her Arizona Votes Early events. (Fox News) \u201cI travel the state and listen to Arizona and I hear a hunger for someone who's focused on just getting common sense results,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cArizonans are looking for someone who's independent, who's going to stand up for them, and not just do what party bosses say. As the third most independent member of Congress, I fit that bill\u2026my opponent has chosen to run a campaign that\u2019s just based on attacks.\u201d Democrats believe they have a huge chance at flipping the seat. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing Republicans on the defensive in Arizona,\u201d said David Bergstein, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) national press secretary. \u201cIt's a state that they are now struggling to hold. Because the demographics in the electorate and the views of the voters have shifted against them\u2026every race is obviously fought and decided on the ground but this is a critical campaign\u2026it\u2019s a highly competitive campaign.\u201d In a Fox News poll among likely voters, Sinema is leading 47 percent to McSally\u2019s 45 percent. (Fox News) A big factor in this race is how voters feel about Trump, said Garcia. The latest Fox News poll shows President Trump has a 51 percent approval rating among likely Arizona voters. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, this year the election is Donald Trump,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThose who support him, those who do not. And it depends on who gets to the polls. If it's going to be Trump supporters, it should be McSally. If it\u2019s some people who are not happy with the direction the country is going on Donald Trump's support and policies, they probably will go with Sinema. So, you know Donald Trump very much is on the ballot although his name does not appear. But he's very much on the ballot with each of these candidates.\u201d McSally served 26 years in the U.S. Air Force, retiring as a full colonel and was the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat and first to command a fighter squadron in combat in U.S. history. \u201cI'm going to continue to fight to make sure we keep us safe, support our military, support our veterans, keep taxes low, roll back regulations, and move us towards a more free society where people can have the choice to be anything they want to be,\u201d McSally said. \u201cThat's what we're all about and that's what I'm going keep leading on when I get to the Senate\u2026I am asking to deploy to the Senate so I can continue to take the same oath of office to continue to fight for our freedoms and way of life.\u201d Meanwhile, Sinema became a social worker after college to help struggling families and has been emphasizing her upbringing. She faced poverty growing up but eventually ended up getting a full-ride college scholarship. \u201cRight now, what I hear from everyday Arizonans is that they\u2019re looking for a senator who understands the challenges that they\u2019re going through,\" Sinema said.\u00a0\"They want someone who understands how hard it is to get access to healthcare, who\u2019s going to protect their benefits for social security and Medicare, who cares about education for their kids, and who\u2019s going to stand up for veterans and military families. That\u2019s the work that we\u2019re doing, we\u2019ve been laser-focused from day one to take care of everyday Arizonans.\u201d About 80 percent of Arizona voters choose to receive their ballot in the mail, according to Arizona Clean Elections, which means many Arizonans may vote early.",

            "article_content": "Welcome to FOX News First. Not signed up yet?\u00a0Click\u00a0here. Developing now, Wednesday, Sept. 12,\u00a02018 THE LEAD STORY \u2013 'THIS STORM IS A MONSTER':\u00a0As Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 storm, drove toward the East Coast, lawmakers from three states in the \u201cmonster\u201d storm\u2019s path ordered mass evacuations for more than a million people Tuesday ...\u00a0\u00a0North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, whose state \u2013 alongside South Carolina and Virginia \u2013 is forecast to see \u201clife-threatening storm surge\u201d and \u201cdamaging winds,\u201d warned residents of the potential extreme conditions.\u00a0Forecasters said Florence was expected to blow ashore late Thursday or early Friday, then slow down and dump 1 to 2\u00bd feet of rain that could cause flooding well inland and wreak environmental havoc by washing over industrial waste sites and hog farms. President Trump on Tuesday was given an update on Florence by the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and vowed that the government was prepared to respond to the impending hurricane, adding that the public\u2019s safety was his \u201cabsolute highest priority.\u201d\u00a0Trump has declared states of emergency for the Carolinas, as well as Virginia, and canceled campaign events Thursday and Friday in anticipation of the storm. WILL A\u00a0BLUE NEW HAMPSHIRE SEAT\u00a0TURN RED? -\u00a0A Rudy Giuliani-backed congressional candidate seeking to make history as New Hampshire's first black congressman emerged from a crowded field to win the state's GOP primary on Tuesday, as Sen. Bernie Sanders' son was trounced by a large margin in the Democratic contest ...\u00a0\u00a0Eddie Edwards, a Navy veteran, won convincingly over state Sen. Andy Sanborn, who had the endorsement of Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul.\u00a0Giuliani called Edwards a \u201cstrong conservative who believes in low taxes and is a supporter of the \u2018America First\u2019 agenda of President Trump.\u201d Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter\u2019s retirement has made the New Hampshire seat much-coveted among Republicans. There had not been an open seat in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District in more than 16 years, and fittingly, 16 candidates vied on Tuesday to fill it, including 11 Democrats and 5 Republicans. The district, which Fox News ranks as leaning Democratic in November, is considered a key potential battleground in November and a rare opportunity for the GOP to snatch a blue seat. On the Democratic side, Chris Pappas, a former state lawmaker who is serving his third term on the governor's Executive Council, won the party nod. Pappas, who is openly gay, topped Maura Sullivan, a U.S. Marine and Iraq War veteran who served in the Department of Veterans Affairs and at the Pentagon during the Obama administration.\u00a0Both finished well ahead of Sanders' son, 49 -year-old Levi, who did not pick up his father's endorsement. MCCONNELL ADMITS SENATE MIDTERM 'BRAWL':\u00a0Majority leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday said Republican candidates in the most competitive races across the country are in \"a knife fight\" to hold the Senate ...\u00a0McConnell, speaking to reporters in Louisville, Ky., said it's \"just a brawl in every one of those places.\"\u00a0The Kentucky Republican said he hopes \"when the smoke clears we'll still have a majority in the Senate.\" He named nine states, including Tennessee and Indiana, as places where Senate races are \"dead even.\" Not long ago, 2018 was expected to be an easier year for Senate Republicans: Democrats were supposed to be playing defense as Senate candidates ran in conservative states that President Trump handily won two years ago.\u00a0But Real Clear Politics lists eight Senate races as toss-ups: Texas, Arizona, Indiana, Montana, Missouri, Florida, Tennessee, Nevada and North Dakota.\u00a0Some involve red state incumbent Democrats: Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota. MARK MEADOWS VS. PETER STRZOK:\u00a0A top Republican congressman and fired FBI agent Peter Strzok's lawyer traded scathing, no-holds-barred accusations of deliberate dishonesty on Tuesday, one day after newly unearthed text messages showed Strzok discussing a \"media leak strategy\" with the Justice Department in April 2017 ...\u00a0The texts were first outlined in a letter sent by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Monday. In one of the messages, dated April 10, Strzok tells former FBI attorney Lisa Page, \"I had literally just gone to find this phone to tell you I want to talk to you about media leak strategy with DOJ before you go.\" According to Strzok's lawyer, Meadows wildly misinterpreted those texts when he told Rosenstein that they \"should lead a reasonable person to question whether there was a sincere desire to investigate wrongdoing or to place derogatory information in the media to justify a continued probe.\" \u201cThe term \u2018media leak strategy\u2019 in Mr. Strzok\u2019s text refers to a Department-wide initiative to detect and stop leaks to the media,\" Aitan Goelman, Strzok's attorney, said Tuesday. \u201cThe president and his enablers are once again peddling unfounded conspiracy theories to mislead the American people.\u201d CATHOLIC CHURCH FACING ITS SINS:\u00a0A delegation of U.S. cardinals and bishops is going to the Vatican Thursday to meet with Pope Francis over a sex abuse and cover-up scandal in America roiling the Catholic Church ...\u00a0In addition, embattled Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who is facing calls to step down over his handling of sex-abuse cases, revealed he will travel to Rome to meet with the pope \"very soon\" to discuss his possible resignation -- which the cardinal had proposed two years ago.\u00a0Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, would meet with Francis on Thursday in the Apostolic Palace, along with Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, Francis\u2019 top sex abuse adviser. Also involved are two officials from the U.S. conference, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez and Monsignor Brian Bransfield, according to a Vatican statement. DiNardo has said he wants Francis to authorize a full-fledged Vatican investigation into ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was removed as cardinal in July after a credible accusation he groped a teenager.\u00a0DiNardo also has said recent accusations that top Vatican officials \u2014 including the pope \u2014 covered up for McCarrick deserve answers.

            "article_content": "Host of 'Hannity' joins Mark Levin to discuss his background, President Trump's agenda and the promise of the American Dream. This is a rush transcript from \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" July 1, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARK LEVIN, HOST: Hello America. I'm Mark Levin. This Is \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" I have a special guest. Tucker Carlson. It's great to see you, my friend. I'm just kidding. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS: The Great. I've been on TV 23 years, this is the most spectacular studio. LEVIN: Isn't it great? HANNITY: Congratulations, first of all, it's the number one show on Sunday nights. You're killing it, I have to always persuade you to do stuff, you know. There is this fact story to all of this. LEVIN: I owe you and a few other people the fact that I got into radio. You kept prodding me and prodding me, I said... HANNITY: No, annoying is more like it. LEVIN: Right. HANNITY: Oh, I annoyed you. LEVIN: We've known each other for over 20 years. HANNITY: Yes, we're best friends. LEVIN: And you haven't changed at all. You haven't changed at all. I remember when you were doing a local show on WABC and then you hit the big time, you substituted for Rush, you went into syndication, you started with Fox at the very beginning of Fox. HANNITY: 1996. LEVIN: 1996, you've been there the entire time and now, you're really the Babe Ruth of cable TV. You're the Babe Ruth of cable TV. HANNITY: Let's not overstate the case. LEVIN: But you are, and so as the Babe Ruth of cable TV, you're also attacked a lot by the left, I noticed. They try these boycotts every now and then, they attack you, they go after you, what is that like? HANNITY: Wow, this is a great question. The most important thing to me, I don't care, not even a little bit, Mark, one bit what the left thinks of me. I just care about what's right. Like you, I have a love and a passion for this country, and I always brought up in 2016, I do it by design, it's my way. You have your gifts and your unique style. Rush has his, his unique style. I like to be myself, and I saw 13 million more Americans on food stamps, eight million more in poverty. I saw the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s, worst recovery since the '40s; 51% low homeownership, but doubling of the debt. I give those numbers out regularly on purpose because those are real people, real Americans, real suffering and they're suffering because of government failure, and this is your wheelhouse, this is what do you. You do the history of our great founders and framers and philosophers, but at the end of the day, I'm looking at it from a very practical standpoint. What works? Why does it work? LEVIN: But why do you think you're attacked the way that you are? HANNITY: I'm attacked because for a lot of these people, it's about power. We had the most unbelievable week where Pam Bondi is attacked. Think about this, Secretary Nielsen is attacked, Sarah Huckabee is attacked. Conservatives are being thrown out of restaurants, they're being followed, you have high-profile Democrats suggesting that we get confronted in gas stations and restaurants, wherever you see, it's like a mob mentality has taken over. And the real reason for it is that in 500 days, the economy has flipped dramatically. Every economic indicator we have is off the charts. Nobody thought Donald Trump would win, nobody thought he'd get the primary. Nobody thought he'd beat Hillary and nobody thought he would be this successful, and we are now in the silly season where Democrats have only one single playbook, and that is Republicans are racist, sexist, misogynists, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic - and it's one big lie. Let me look at one economic statistic, 14 states in the United States right now have record low unemployment. African-Americans, record low unemployment. Hispanic-Americans, record low unemployment. Women in the workforce, record low unemployment. The success of Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to the left of America. It is a threat to them, and so like when he first got into office, which he never thought they'd win, they're imploding. Now, that he's successful and now that the Mueller witch-hunt which you have been very articulate about is imploding, now that the economy is successful, nobody expected little rocket man to be returning hostages, to be dismantling nuclear test sites, to be willing to talk about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Nobody thought Donald Trump would get that when he was talking about fire and fury and Donald Trump was talking about little rocket man and he was saying, \"My button is bigger than yours and mine works,\" and it shows peace through strength works. It shows that the President's economic philosophy works. How long have we as conservatives known that government bureaucracy is killing business? It is destroying, you know, states like Ohio and Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, all around the country. We now have four million new jobs created in just over 500 days. Why am I attacked? LEVIN: Do you think you are attacked because you give voice to conservatism? HANNITY: Yes. LEVIN: That you are successful in giving voice to conservatism? HANNITY: Yes, all of the above. LEVIN: And because you are a defender of the President and his policies? HANNITY: These policies are working, and to answer your question, it was around-about answer, Mark, directly is that for most of my career, I go with my heart, my gut, but I'm also very connected to those people that are out of work. You know, I bought a painting by John McNaughton, and he's a patriotic and religious painter. He's out of Salt Lake City, and it's the forgotten man, and the forgotten man painting is a young man on a bench and all the Presidents and Obama stomped - got his foot on the Constitution, which you revere, and the reason that this election was about them, you know my background, I don't want to bore you. LEVIN: Do you think - well, that's what I want to get to. Do you think you identify with these folks? HANNITY: 100%. LEVIN: And the President's policies because of how you grew up and your background and how you came up and your parents. Explain. HANNITY: Okay, my grandparents came here with on average $10.00 in their pocket from Ireland at the turn of the last century. They had no hopes, no dreams, except to make a better life for their children, and hence my parents did better, and I literally believe, I stand on the shoulders of those four grandparents, all four came from Ireland, and my parent, they never really had any money. LEVIN: They were modest, middle class parents. HANNITY: Mark, I was delivering papers at eight, washing dishes at 12, by hand, not a machine in a restaurant, every Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I became a chef, a bus boy, a waiter, a bartender and then I got into contracting - painting, hanging wallpaper, laying tiles, framing houses, fell off a roof. LEVIN: Come to my house, I need some tile work done. HANNITY: You need some work done? LEVIN: There we go. HANNITY: Yes, the answer to your questions is, I'm a dishwasher who works hard and harder than I've ever worked and that I believe in this country and I believe that I've been blessed more than I deserve, and I absolutely, positively, I abhor that the fact when America is in decline, this country can be, and is, the shining city on the hill as Reagan talked about. And it is frankly my obligation - look, I now made money, I've lived with no money, and now I have money, it's better to have money, and it's better to have opportunity, and it's better to have a growing, thriving economy, and it's also better to have peace in the world. And we don't need to be at war with everybody. LEVIN: What did your parents do? HANNITY: My mom was a prison guard for 25 years. My dad worked in Family Court Probation. Most of my family was in law enforcement. It was a big deal. Nobody - I've never told this story, I was appointed to the New York Police Academy when I was 19. LEVIN: Really? HANNITY: Nineteen or twenty, last minute, I took the - believe it or not, I passed the psychological, passed the physical. I got 99 to the written, I was appointed to the Academy in like two days before, I said, \"I don't know,\" but I have no idea why I made that decision, because it was a big deal in my family to be a civil servant. The two relatives I had that made it to the FBI, they were like a deity. That's why it hurts for me to be looking at corruption in the FBI, not to get too off track here. Look, America is supposed to be - we all want the same thing in a way. Everybody wants a nice house, in a safe neighborhood. They want a decent car to drive. They want to go out to dinner once a month or every two weeks. They want to take their kids when they are five or six to Disney, but they're willing to work hard for that, and when government, through its burdensome regulation and its high taxes, you know, think where the Democrats want to run on this midterm election? This midterm election is the single biggest, most important midterm in this country's history. Because they want to impeach this man. Now, they're telling people like Maxine Waters, \"Shhh, don't tell anybody. We got it. We got it. We want to impeach him.\" They don't have a reason to impeach him. There's no high crimes or misdemeanors. LEVIN: I agree. HANNITY: But what else do they want to do? They want open borders. They want to keep Obamacare and you know the biggest tax cut in our history, $2,000.00 around on average per family, what Nancy Pelosi, a millionaire calls crumbs, they want the crumbs back. They want to rescind those tax cuts - $2,000.00 in the pockets of families makes a massive difference in their daily life. LEVIN: How do you explain the so-called never-Trumpers? The President's been enormously successful in foreign policy. A lot of them come out of Bush administration, sort of the neoconservative movement in that genre. When you look at Iran, the President did exactly the right thing. When you look at Israel, recognizing Jerusalem as the capital and moving the Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, that was the law that was bypassed by every President except this President. When you look at how they started with North Korea, people may quibble over the things he has said so on and so forth, but the fact is, he has done more with North Korea in terms of - first of all, putting the military threat out there and then driving the dictator to the table than any previous President. HANNITY: It's called peace through strength. LEVIN: Peace through strength, but when you look at... HANNITY: You worked for Reagan. LEVIN: I worked for Reagan and I supported Trump in the general election. HANNITY: Yes, did you. LEVIN: And see a lot of similarities, I'm not talking about the way they speak, but there's a charisma to both of these men, and there is a principle to both these men, and I'm concerned that there are some people who claim to be conservatives, who don't recognize it either because they've had a personal tiff with him or they're very thin skinned about approaches and so forth and so on. HANNITY: I've got one other thing, they don't want to admit they're wrong. LEVIN: And you've been in a fight with a lot of these people. HANNITY: You know, it's not even a fight because the American people are winning now. Look, I'm going to make a prediction. Donald Trump is a transformational President, and I don't believe he's a nationalist and I don't believe he's a populist. I have always remained in my entire career consistent. I am a Reagan conservative, and, which you were the Chief of Staff for Ed Meese, one of the greatest Attorney Generals we ever had, and so you know Reagan's policies as I do. I can cite the economic and the statistics, 20 million new jobs, literally doubled revenues to the government. Revenues going... LEVIN: And he was hated, too. Attacked by the same force. HANNITY: Wait a minute, he was called an amiable dunce by Republican establishment figures, and voodoo economics was a Bush term. LEVIN: Look, it took him three times to get the nomination. He was attacked all the time, the media hated him, hated him, but they hate Trump more. HANNITY: More. LEVIN: And my view of that is, and see if you agree, they thought Hillary was going to win, they banked on Hillary, they wanted their third term of Obama and this man wins, surprises everyone; probably surprises himself. The American people rose up and said, \"Enough is enough, we want to try this man,\" and this is not just an attack from my perspective on Trump. This is an attack on the American people. And can you hear it more and more, Scarborough talking about Trump voters as racist. Now, the Trump voters are racist. Hillary calling them deplorables. They're attacking tens of millions of Americans. HANNITY: Mark, look at Strzok-Page text. I go to Walmart and can smell the Trump people. There's a contempt, and the left has always had this for conservatives, but there's a contempt for people. Now, okay, I'm that dishwasher, I'm that bus boy, I'm that contractor. I identify with the people that make the country great. Here's why I think Trump's a transformational figure. This office will never be viewed again the same way. I think there were three in our lifetime, three movements, really profound moments... LEVIN: I want to pick up on this, but I don't want to cut you short on this. HANNITY: Okay. LEVIN: I want to hear the whole... HANNITY: You want to take a break and we'll be right back and we'll continue \"Life, Liberty & Levin?\" LEVIN: You know the format. I want to hear this at length when we return. HANNITY: You've got it. LEVIN: Folks, you can check us out on LevinTV almost every week night. Got to crtv.com, sign up or call 844-LEVIN-TV. 844-LEVIN-TV. We'd love to have you. We'll be right back. Sean Hannity, you were talking about transformational Presidents. Go right ahead. HANNITY: Let's go back to the Reagan comparison for a second. I'm looking at Trump. Beside trade, and I know where you stand on trade. LEVIN: Okay. HANNITY: Okay, let's put that aside. LEVIN: Right. HANNITY: You and I have discussed privately. I still think everything is a negotiation, we're never going to get to that point, because I know this man pretty well. Donald Trump, if you go back to Reagan, Reagan was hated by the establishment as we were discussing, and all of a sudden, we get 20 million new jobs, longest period of peacetime economic growth. Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall, the evil empire; kind of similar to little rocket man fire and fury, and now even Democrats can't help but acknowledge how great the Reagan years were. Same thing is going to happen to Donald Trump, in this sense, the office of the Presidency is never going to be viewed the same way again. He has broken every rule of establishment politics, and what the left hasn't figured out is the American people have figured out like for example, the media will act all outraged over Donald Trump tweeted this, and then so you watch these stupid cable people that live in a bubble and they talk to each other only, not to any real audience, so to speak, and they'll say, \"That's outrageous,\" and the next one will say, \"No, that's really, really outrageous.\" \"No, that's outrageous and disgusting.\" And this is their own world. Meanwhile, the American people are saying four million new jobs, \"Wow, the economy has never been better,\" consumer confidence has never been higher. Record low unemployment all over the place. So, here's my argument. We're going to look back in our lifetime and we're going to realize that he has systematically changed - he's taken the bar higher in the sense that people want to get things done. American people are practical, commonsense people, and if it works, they don't want these guys playing games. Look, I'll give you an example, I hate Republicans in this sense, Republicans never for all the years they talked about healthcare, when we had a healthcare debate, we never talked about health savings accounts, we never talked about healthcare cooperatives, you and I have read Musgrave, Goodman, patient power, the CATO Foundation - all about health savings account. Who talked about health savings accounts but for Rand Paul and a couple of others? And who talked about healthcare cooperatives? Those innovative, so-called intellectual ideas of conservatives, they weren't even discussed and they tried to ram through an establishment bill and they couldn't keep a simple promise that they all made for seven and a half years. Donald Trump comes in, \"Okay, I'll do it all,\" and they couldn't get the job done. LEVIN: What else has Donald Trump done? HANNITY: He's cut taxes. LEVIN: No, no, no. He's exposed the media, and this is why they hate him. I'm convinced, the media had played this game with the American people for decades that they're objective and/or bipartisan and they're only reporting the news. He's shown them to be a pseudo-profession. It's not a profession at all and what he's shown them also to be is group think of one mind. There's different characters, different levels of intelligence, some of them quasi intelligence, if you will, and so forth, he drives them nuts because he calls them out and then they accuse him of attacking... HANNITY: Them. LEVIN: ... press freedom. He's not attacking press freedom. He's pointing out how they are undermining press freedom. HANNITY: In 2007 and 2008, I said journalism in America is dead. LEVIN: I remember this. Right. HANNITY: I didn't know how right I was at the time. Here's what they haven't figured out and I love this part. What they haven't figured out at CNN, CNN they have been so branded, they will forever be known as fake news - CNN. The same with the broadcast networks, I think one of the funniest things the President does, and if you have a sense of humor and you understand Donald Trump and the American people seem to understand him and they accept that he's not your cookie cutter politician, that is politically correct, that won't take a chance, but I think during his rallies, see those people in the back, fake news, fake news, and the crowd turns around on their own, not led by Trump, CNN sucks, or fake news, and they shout at them, because - and I would be thinking if I was running a network and every state, every group of people were saying \"Hannity sucks,\" I think I might take it personally at some point and say, \"Well, what am I doing wrong?\" Where is it disconnect? LEVIN: But there's a reason why the Democratic Party agenda and the media are so in sync? HANNITY: Sure. LEVIN: Let me ask you this, when was the last time the \"Washington Post\" or \"New York Times\" led with a front page headline story supportive of a Trump policy? HANNITY: Is that a joke? LEVIN: It's like I've told you when I was on your show, it's like the text from the FBI, can you point out one that's pro-Trump? HANNITY: No. LEVIN: Can you point out one that's anti-Hillary? HANNITY: No. LEVIN: Can you point out one pro-Trump senior FBI official? HANNITY: No. LEVIN: Anti-Hillary senior FBI official. HANNITY: You know what the best line you ever said on my show? You pointed out rightly so, sadly, that again, not rank and file FBI, I am very careful to make a ... LEVIN: We're the ones that defend the rank and file in the FBI, and we're doing it today by trying to clean up the top mess. HANNITY: I'll tell you, I'll even take it a step further, the heroes at the end of the story are going to be rank and file FBI, the special agents that are dying to tell their story about how corrupt their top bosses were, and I ... LEVIN: I'm waiting for my best line ever on TV. HANNITY: Okay, yes, we'll, I'm going to tell you. Your best line ever was, \"Sadly ...\" it's a sad line, but it's true and captures it all, \"... that literally what they have done to try and subvert an election is far worse than anything Russia could have imagined.\" This is why nobody seems to understand how profound this is, and the other part of this is the IG report is only the beginning. This is what happened, Hillary committed felonies, Hillary obstructed justice. It was covered up by the top-ranking FBI officials - Comey, Page, Strzok, Loretta Lynch to an extent, Andrew McCabe, and others, and they covered it up, they rigged an investigation, they wrote an exoneration before they interviewed her and 17 other people. That never happens. There have been other people that have gone to jail for far less than what Hillary Clinton did, and they did it so she could remain the candidate. We've seen written text how much they love her and then they turned on Trump. I think you've used the term, I know I've used the term, I think Russia has used the term and I think it's an accurate term, which is a \"soft coup.\" This has never happened. This is the biggest, single abuse of power, scandal, corruption scandal in American history. And back to the media, they have missed the biggest story in their lives while simultaneously pushing a phony Russian narrative because their fixation is not helping the American people, but destroying one man after they supported her. LEVIN: The media want Trump out. HANNITY: They want him to fail. LEVIN: They go after his family. HANNITY: It's disgusting. LEVIN: They go after his staff. They go after his campaign, and he's exposed them. HANNITY: 100%. LEVIN: And you were saying, CNN will never be viewed the same. HANNITY: Ever. LEVIN: The media will ever be viewed the same. HANNITY: Ever. LEVIN: We'll be right back. ROBERT GRAY, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Robert Gray. Exit polls are in for Mexico's Presidential election and they're predicting victory for leftist candidate, Andrew Manuel Lopez Obrador. The exit poll conducted by Mexico City based polling firm Parametria shows the former Mexico City Mayor winning with between 53% and 59% of the vote. Obrador's two closest opponents, left- right alliance candidate Ricardo Anaya and Jose Antonio Meade of the ruling institutional revolutionary party both have conceded. LeBron James is taking his talents to Los Angeles. The four-time NBA MVP is leaving his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers for a second time, agreeing for a four-year $154 million deal with the LA Lakers. The 33-year-old star will join a struggling Lakers squad that's coming off five straight losing seasons. I'm Robert Gray, now back to \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" LEVIN: You know, Sean Hannity, believe it or not, people are going to want to know how we've met, how we became best friends, that sort of thing. How did we meet? I don't even remember it. HANNITY: I don't even know, that's a great question. By the way, we think we're so smart, we're not that smart, I guess. LEVIN: I don't remember, do you? It was a long time ago. HANNITY: No, but this is interesting for me because this is role reversal, because I interview you. LEVIN: Right. HANNITY: Look, let me tell you... LEVIN: You like interviewing me? HANNITY: Yes, I do, actually. LEVIN: Why? HANNITY: I interview you, and I take out my phone. I don't have it with me, and I'll throw you one question, we actually have timed your answers, they are six-minute answers, but they're chockfull, but I like to let you do your thing. LEVIN: This is when I'm on \"Hannity\" during the week. HANNITY: Look, I'm on - I don't like to do interviews like this, not because I don't like to do them, it's just I feel four hours a day is enough for me. I'm on three hours on radio, an hour on TV, how much do people want of me? But I always interview you, although you've interviewed me on your radio show before, and - but interviewing you is - what I find as I've gotten to be a better host because I listen more. I get my monologue out, I work on that thing from 8:00 in the morning until 9:00 at night, and I'm... LEVIN: You write your own monologue? HANNITY: Every day, yes, absolutely, and I have a staff that helps put the tapes together. LEVIN: Do you read it off the board, or sometimes I can tell you are just doing it off your mind, right away. HANNITY: If I have 13 minutes written, it's really a 20-minute monologue, because the radio in me comes out and I have the best prompter, I have signals, I'll give you my signals. So, I'll be reading the prompter and I'll go like that, that's my signal don't move, or I'll look away. LEVIN: In other words, keep it where it is because I have other things to say. HANNITY: That's right, and... (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: We add at least five to seven minutes to every monologue and I use them all. There is so much to talk about. what I think has made me a better host, I actually have read enough research on me over the years, and when you're doing something wrong, your audience, they are smarter than you are, they're watching. If I interrupt somebody, they get frustrated, \"Stop interrupting,\" and I find if I get it out in the beginning and put it together and try and make the best case every day. We start with an empty canvas, every single day, it's a new day and the challenge is you always have to assume there are new people that are watching, and so you've got to set the foundation, but also keep bringing in the new information, and I try and do it as creative way as I can. And it's a little bit of a challenge every day, but in all honesty, it's ... LEVIN: So I come on and I speak for six minutes? HANNITY: I let you go, but it works. LEVIN: Have you ever interrupted me? HANNITY: I try not to. I try not to interrupt like I used to. The only restraints we have are the constraints of time. LEVIN: We all have that. HANNITY: ... but I honestly feel this is history unfolding before our eyes. I never finished the thought earlier, there was the Reagan revolution, it transformed the country. I was the emcee the night Newt Gingrich became the Speaker of the House. I lived in Georgia, I was a local radio host, and we're now in the third wave of this, and it's Donald Trump, the conservative, not all this nationalist, populism. He's governing as a conservative. HANNITY: You think it went Reagan revolution, tea party, Trump revolution. HANNITY: No, Reagan revolution, tea party is a big component. Reagan, Newt contract ... LEVIN: Tea party. HANNITY: Tea party and now Trump. And Trump will, I think, like Reagan at some point, people are going to realize how transformational it is. We can't predict the future. I mean, you never know if there is a major economic downturn that may be out of all our control. You don't know about peace and prosperity, but I do know that this President looks at, you know, he says he wants to meet Putin and he's developed a good relationship with the President of China, I think we already see dividends vis-a-vis North Korea, if we can denuclearize, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, is that not good for our kids and grandkids? LEVIN: Well, it is, and you know Reagan talked about getting rid of nukes altogether? HANNITY: He did. LEVIN: And keep something in mind, too, as you point out here. He's friendly with the dictator of China, but he's tough on China ... HANNITY: Very. LEVIN: So he doesn't allow that to get in the way of his policies. HANNITY: Nope. LEVIN: And I noticed that, too. Back let's get back to you. When did you start in radio? HANNITY: Wow. It's either '86 - it's '87, 1987. It didn't last very long. I wasn't very good at it. I just knew that I wanted to be on the radio. Howard Stern tells a great story, and if you watch his movie \"Private Parts,\" it may sound a little bizarre ... LEVIN: Never watched it. HANNITY: You should watch it because it actually - I identify with everything that he did. He once said, \"The light went on the first time I was on radio,\" and I have no idea where this comes from. None. It just came out, and I knew I loved it from the first time I did it. I have the tapes. They're horrific. It's embarrassing. LEVIN: You can burn them, you know. HANNITY: I'm going to. My son actually who is 19 heard it once and he literally said to me, \"Oh, dad.\" And put his hands over his face and said, \"That's embarrassing.\" But I've been very fortunate in my career in the sense that I loved it. I ate it up, and I never had a vision that I could do it after growing up listening to radio, and then I did it, and then I wanted to do nothing else, and then I finally got a job, traveled - this is where it's similar to Howard Stern, I started traveling around the country, and I lived five years in Rhode Island, five years in California, two years in Alabama, four years in Georgia. I never thought I'd be successful. I always assumed and until today that I've done my last show. LEVIN: And when we return, what was your big break? What would you consider to be your big break? Don't forget, folks, to check us out on LevinTV almost every week night, go to crtv.com, crtv.com, join us, we'd love to have you or call us at 844-LEVIN-TV. 844-LEVIN-TV. We'll be right back. Welcome back. So, Sean Hannity, radio, what was your big radio break? HANNITY: It wasn't just one. Well, you can't deny when you fill in for Rush, who's - look, he's the pioneer. He forged the path. We all owe him a debt of gratitude. LEVIN: Absolutely. HANNITY: And I'm very appreciative, but I grew up listening to all these radio guys, Farber, Barry Gray, Bob Grant, John Shroyer was a money guy, and then I went and lived there in Rhode Island listening to Jerry Williams, Gene Berns - these real pioneers of talk radio. The big break was a guy, Dave Stone and Bill Dunn have been two guys, Huntsville, Alabama, my first paid radio gig. I was doing it for free up until then and I packed up what was my contracting work van and I drove across the country. That was break one. Break two was a guy by the name of Sluggo, Eric Seidel in Atlanta, Georgia. Neal Boortz who is now a friend of ours, since retired. He left one station, which he referred to as his ex-wife and moved to a bigger station and now I'm on that station ironically, WSB and then big break was Fox News going on the air, and then that led to WABC, Roger Ailes and Phil Boyce. It's funny because I'm friends with every single person that ever hired me. I talk to them all. They all critique me to this day. If I'm do something they don't like, Sluggo is writing me, \"Let him talk, shut up. Don't talk.\" I'm getting PVs, but they care. I actually prefer the criticism rather than the compliment because that makes you better. LEVIN: And, you know, you're one of the few people who have been able to do radio and TV. In fact, you're the only one I know for a couple of decades now. No, but you've done it for a couple of decades. HANNITY: Twenty three years. LEVIN: Twenty three years, and how do you have the energy for this? HANNITY: I mean, I don't know, I can flip the question. If I didn't do it every day, I'd be riding around in a car doing my own talk show probably out loud. LEVIN: Talking to yourself? HANNITY: Talking to myself. LEVIN: On the corner with a rain coat. HANNITY: Probably, and saying okay, I'd be going \"John in Atlanta.\" LEVIN: You could be caught in talk shows, wouldn't you? HANNITY: \"Hi Sean, longtime listener, first time caller.\" Yes. I'd be doing both parts. LEVIN: You'd call into talk shows early on? HANNITY: I was on ladders doing construction calling talk shows. When Ollie North's hearing were going on, and he since like you became a dear friend, you were very involved in that, I couldn't go to work. I sat there and watched those hearings. Brendan Sullivan, a friend of yours, I'm not a potted plant. LEVIN: Unbelievable. HANNITY: There was an unbelievable - or when Ollie North, when he went like this or when they thought they had him because he bought leotards for his young daughter, the dancer and they thought. \"Well ...\" I think it was Fawn Hall, \"Oh, he had to have been having an affair.\" The media was corrupt then. LEVIN: So you were calling radio shows? HANNITY: Every day. Absolutely. And what I noticed is that I got more reaction than the hosts. I want to talk about what that guy just said. I was so passionate about it, it was my love. It was my passion. Reagan, I studied him from day one, and then I got into studying on my own. LEVIN: How old are you? HANNITY: Good question, 56. LEVIN: And you started in radio, how old were you? HANNITY: Twenty-seven-ish. LEVIN: And so you started on Fox, you were in your 30s? HANNITY: Yes, early 30s - 23 years. LEVIN: You think can you do this for another 10 or 20 years? HANNITY: I don't think about it. People say, \"Well, what part do you think ... \" I just do my thing every day. Here's my analogy, and I don't like when people get too egotistical in their life, and they think. \"I did this,\" there are people in our business, I've always believed like what the Bible said, \"If you're not against us, you're for us.\" In that sense, even people that hate both of us, if they're doing good things for the country, I don't care what they say about me. I want the country to succeed. I view it as we're all spokes in a wheel, and every spoke is necessary to make the wheel go round. And by the way, every American citizen voting for example in 2018, they want to undo your - undo the last election. They want to do-over, 2018 is a do-over. There's four things they want to do and I mentioned them earlier. They want to impeach the President. They want open borders. They want to keep Obamacare and they want their crumbs back. And we can't let this happen. Midterms usually aren't that important, really, and the first midterm in any presidency historically with a couple of exceptions the power - the party that has the presidency is going to lose seats. We can't have that had this time. Because if we do, they doll those four things, and they so hate this President, and the American people - the FBI agents that tried to undermine Trump in the soft coup, those people thought they knew better than the American people. It's arrogance, it's power, those are in your books, all those philosophers that you talk about and I've read every one of your books. All of those framers and founders, they warned about tyranny in government. There's contempt right now for the American people. One last thing, and I don't mean to interrupt you. This is a tipping point for the country, Mark. We better get this right or we'd lose it. If they're successful in their effort to undermine Donald Trump and push him out of office, we've lost the country and we'll never get it back. You know what you once said? LEVIN: What? I love it, he quotes me. HANNITY: You once said ... LEVIN: Some people quote Churchill ... HANNITY: \"We are the post constitutional America,\" you are right. You were right. you are ahead of the curve and it's more the dynamic nature of that statement is unfolding before our eyes. This is a transformational moment. This is a live or die moment for the country. That's what motivates me, you want to know where I get the energy from? From there and from getting the American people back to work and making this a better country for our kids and grandkids, like I stand on the shoulders of my father's and grandfather's. LEVIN: We'll be right back. What do you make of the state of the Republican party? HANNITY: Weak. Feckless. The Bible says where there is no vision, the people perish. Lacking leadership. LEVIN: Who do you blame it on? HANNITY: Most of them. Honestly, the people I trust the most in Congress right now are the Freedom Caucus. Those guys fight for the things they have done. You know what the Republican Party is missing? They literally - it's a layup for them if they would just follow the courage, the strength, the principles and the promise keeping of Donald Trump. If you want to get re-elected, instead of sitting there agonizing, calculating, what's going to happen, what if do I this? What if I vote this way? How about you just keep your promises. HANNITY: Why do we need a Freedom Caucus within the Republican Party? Shouldn't that be the Republican Party? HANNITY: It should be the Republican Party. This of this. The reason they couldn't repeal and replace Obamacare is because there were a hundred of Republicans that never had any intention of repealing and replacing Obamacare. They're as bad as the Democrats. In Senate, in 2015, they voted to repeal Obamacare - straight vote, and then seven of them, when it actually mattered, less than two years later, \"Oh, we didn't really mean it.\" LEVIN: And the House was even worse. They voted to repeal and they wouldn't vote to repeal it. HANNITY: Well, the House at least passed a lot of bills that the Senate never took up. There's over 400 of those. So, I give them a little more credit, not a lot. Here's what's missing, where is the principle of lower taxes, limited government, cutting bureaucracy? Where is the principle of securing our borders? Where is the principle of supporting a President that has literally given us a path to energy independence that will create millions of high-paying career jobs for so many Americans? He did it independently in spite of them. And he is more at war with his party than he is actually with the Democratic Party. I expect it from them, but the reality is in Washington today, I'm not a registered Republican, I'm a conservative. I've always been a consistent Reagan conservative and for all these idiot never-Trumper people is that they're not consistent, and now their egos are so humongous, they can't - they don't want to admit they're wrong, so like the media doesn't want to admit they're wrong. That's your answer. LEVIN: We'll be right back. Where do you see Sean Hannity in ten years or so? HANNITY: I have a idea. I hope I am alive. I have kids I want to take care of. I would love to see my grandkids. LEVIN: Do you think you'll be in radio and TV? HANNITY: I have never planned any of this. I never thought I'd be here on your show. LEVIN: Would you like to be in radio or on TV in ten years? HANNITY: I probably cannot give it up and it's because I care more than I've ever cared. I think the stakes are higher than they ever have been. I think, I'm a spoke in a wheel and I have got an opportunity and I want to do my part. This country is worth fighting for. So many have bled, fought, bled, died and given their limbs for this country and to allow a culture of corruption to now put its - as you said, post Constitutional America and the rule of law and we don't have equal justice under the law or equal application of our laws. If we don't get that straight for our kids, I will feel like a failure. LEVIN: It has been a great pleasure. HANNITY: There's a reason I call you the great one, you know. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Thank you for having me. LEVIN: It's my pleasure. You're motivated as ever and that's a good thing.

            "article_content": "President Trump decries threats of violence against Democrats at Wisconsin rally. At a major campaign rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday evening, President Trump decried any threats of political violence as \"an attack on our democracy itself,\" saying \"we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony\" -- and he also took aim at the media, charging that they are contributing to the problem. His comments came just hours after apparent explosive devices were sent to a series of top Democratic politicians, including former President Barack Obama, former Attorney General Eric Holder\u00a0and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \"My highest duty as president is to keep America safe,\" Trump told his audience at\u00a0the\u00a0Central Wisconsin Airport\u00a0in Mosinee. \"The federal government is conducting an impressive investigation, and we will find those responsible, and we will bring them to justice, hopefully very quickly.\" He continued: \"Those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective. The language of moral condemnation ... these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop. No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villians. It's got to stop. We should not mob people in public spaces or destroy public property. UTAH MAN ARRESTED BY FBI AFTER SENDING CRUDE FORM OF RICIN TO TRUMP, PENTAGON \"There is one way to settle our disagreements: It's called peacefully, at the ballot box,\" Trump said to applause. (\"If you're going to vote Democrat, don't bother,\" he later joked.) \"The media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks,\" he added. \"Those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective.\" The president's appearance was planned primarily to promote vulnerable incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Senate candidate Leah Vukmir, and\u00a0thousands of attendees lined\u00a0up more than 20 hours in advance wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats. Fox News ranks the gubernatorial contest as lean Democrat and the Senate race as likely Democrat, although Trump told Vukmir at Wednesday's rally that she's doing \"very well\" in the polls. During his speech, Trump said that Walker, his former rival in the 2016 presidential race,\u00a0\"could be nasty\" -- but he emphasized that the two have seen eye-to-eye ever since\u00a0electronics giant\u00a0Foxconn announced the creation of a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin expected to\u00a0create thousands of jobs. \"This is one of the world's great plants,\" Trump, who narrowly edged out Clinton in Wisconsin in 2016, said. \"And it was done because of Scott Walker. I've never seen anything like it. ... He's a warrior for Wisconsin workers and families.\" Both Walker and Vukmir, responding to a common Democratic line of attack,\u00a0strenuously declared that Republicans would preserve healthcare protections for people with pre-existing conditions. \"I'll fall in front of a truck before I let people go without coverage for pre-existing conditions,\" Vukmir said. In the wide-ranging rally, Trump also touted the nation's historically low unemployment rate, and\u00a0vowed to keep appointing conservative judges and to secure the nation's border as a migrant caravan makes its way to the U.S.-Mexico border. \"We don't have borders, we don't have a country -- and we have the greatest country on earth,\" Trump said, adding later: \"African-American,\u00a0Hispanic-American poverty, Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest rates ever recorded -- isn't that a tough soundbite for the opponent? And in addition to that, Kanye West likes me. Which is good. Interesting guy.\" Asked on CNN whether Trump should have canceled the rally entirely,\u00a0Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who said earlier that both political parties should tone down their rhetoric, offered another idea. \"I think he ought to use this rally as a way to actually make things better,\" Flake\u00a0told anchor Wolf Blitzer.\u00a0\"I don't begrudge him going to the rally. I just hope that he makes better use of it than he has in the past.\" At previous rallies, Trump has derided CNN and other media organizations as \"fake news,\" and\u00a0mocked prominent Democrats like California Rep. Maxine Waters, describing some of them as \"low-IQ.\" Waters, for her part, had made vocal calls for her supporters to harass Trump officials in public. The FBI said Wednesday evening that it had identified at least five suspicious packages\u00a0sent to prominent liberals this week that contained \"potentially destructive devices,\" including one addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan -- care of CNN -- which prompted the dramatic on-air evacuation of the network's New York City headquarters. (Law enforcement officials involved in the investigation have told Fox News that the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible.) At an event in Texas Wednesday night, Brennan, a fierce Trump critic, again blamed the president: \"A lot of this rhetoric really is counterproductive, it is un-American, it is what a president should not be doing.\" Trump revoked Brennan's security clearance in August, as critics charged that he was improperly trading on his classified access for political gain. WATCH: CNN ANCHORS SCRAMBLE AS ALARM SOUNDS ON-AIR Meanwhile, Waters said Wednesday she had received a \"suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI.\"\u00a0 Late Wednesday, the Los Angeles Central Mail facility was evacuated after employees found a suspicious package, which The Associated Press reported was addressed to Waters. The FBI confirmed that it had recovered two packages addressed to Waters that were similar to the five it referenced in its earlier statement. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also announced that he had received a suspect device, but it was later determined to be an innocuous USB flash drive and a letter. Speaking at the White House earlier Wednesday, Trump was somber and resolute, issuing\u00a0a rare call for partisans to come together as he promised that authorities would \"bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice.\" \"In these times, we have to unify,\" Trump said, following similarly conciliatory remarks by his wife Melania. \"We have to come together, and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.\" DEVICES SENT TO OBAMA, CLINTON, CNN HAD SIMILAR APPEARANCES, OFFICIAL SAYS However, several analysts on CNN and social media immediately criticized Trump's remarks, saying he should have mentioned CNN by name. They also accused Trump of contributing\u00a0to the declining civility in politics, charging that he should\u00a0have shouldered more blame for the episode. Former Obama chief adviser Dan Pfeiffer blamed Trump for \"advanc[ing] a racist conspiracy theory\" about his old boss and for irresponsibly riling up his base. And, within hours, leading Democrats apparently rejected Trump's olive branch\u00a0out of hand. In a joint statement,\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u00a0pointed to remarks by the president at a rally in Montana last week, when he praised a Republican congressman who body-slammed a reporter as a \"tough cookie,\" and\u00a0his frequent criticisms of CNN and other media organizations. \"President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence,\" Schumer and Pelosi said. Last week, Pelosi\u00a0was accosted by a mob\u00a0calling her a \"communist\" during a Florida campaign stop. Meanwhile,\u00a0Republicans have spent the last several months calling out Democrats for contributing to the charged political climate. Earlier this month, Clinton\u00a0said it was impossible to be civil with Republicans as long as Democrats are out of power, and numerous\u00a0high-ranking Republicans\u00a0have been harassed\u00a0in public. Last year, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., was nearly killed, and two others were wounded, when a gunman opened fire at a GOP congressional baseball practice where Flake and others were present. And earlier this month, a\u00a0Utah man was arrested and accused of attempting to send a crude form of the poison ricin to President Trump and\u00a0the Pentagon.

            "article_content": "Part 1: Some Americans may not realize that Hasidic Jews shun many common secular practices widely accepted across cultural and national borders, including the basics of education. For example, there are several yeshivas, or Hasidic Jewish schools, in the New York area that only teach subjects in Yiddish. Previous yeshiva students share the impact of these practices in their lives. This is the first of a three-part series on insular enclaves of ultra-Orthodox Jews, the struggles they face and the controversies that follow them. It is, by choice, an intensely isolated and insular group, in which a Hasidic family with 10 children doesn\u2019t raise an eyebrow. The big family units help explain why some communities they inhabit become among the poorest in the country, according to federal statistics on rates of welfare assistance, subsidized housing, food stamps and Medicaid. Indeed, the U.S. town with the highest rate of people on food stamps is the all-Hasidic New York village of New Square, north of New York City, where 77 percent of residents rely on the program to eat, according to a new report. Yet for all that need, the group is alternately courted, feared and vilified by politicians and businesses for its power to deliver huge, uncontested blocs of election-altering votes, donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to causes of its choosing, spark seismic shifts in real estate markets, public school budgets and city planning, and even hold hostage the country\u2019s second-largest state budget. This particularly strict group of Orthodox Jews, entrenched and concentrated primarily in a few communities in New York and New Jersey, has generated more indifference than curiosity -- until now. That is because Hasidic communities have been outgrowing their enclaves and pushing to establish outposts in new towns, leading to pitched battles all over the New York region. Hasidic residents and leaders say that bigotry is at the root of the battles -- many of which have ended up in court, which often have ruled in the religious community's favor. Their critics deny bigotry, and say it's a matter of sudden changes to towns that end up adversely affecting the quality of life. A familiar pattern \"[Our critics] are insane. ... Our education system doesn't have a metal detector you have to go through, we have zero tolerance on drugs.\" Critics of the Hasidic groups say development in many towns has followed a familiar pattern: The group moves into a community, then begins to overwhelm local government and social services with explosive population growth. That\u2019s accompanied by rapid construction of low-cost, densely packed housing units -- typically townhouses -- though even these, eventually, can\u2019t contain the growth. Hasidic leaders or developers with ties to them then buy up nearby homes, gain control of the local school board, ultimately gut public school budgets and divert funds to private Jewish schools. There have been echoes of this pattern in places including\u00a0Bloomingburg, a once-rural upstate New York town, and Toms River, N.J., to name but a few examples. All this, while Hasidic households with very modest incomes collect millions in federal benefits, often because of large family sizes. \u201cThey know how to game the system,\u201d said Samuel C. Heilman, a sociology professor at Queens College of the City University of New York.\u00a0 \u201cThey know the ins and outs, or they get professionals and find out how to apply for things like Section 8\" housing subsidies. \"Their leadership is intertwined with the political system in order to get favorable entry.\u201d \"It's usually done legally,\" said Heilman, author of the book \u201cWho Will Lead Us?: The Story of Five Hasidic Dynasties in America,\u201d in reference to how Hasidic Jews so expertly navigate the system. The depiction of their use of government programs as \"gaming\" the system exasperates many Hasidim. Rabbi Avi Shafran, the director of public public affairs for Agudath Israel of America, an umbrella organization for Hasidic and other ultra-Orthodox groups, told Fox News that characterizations such as \"gaming\" are pejorative ways to describe a talent for perceiving opportunities that, for these communities, can yield government services. \"That\u2019s not \u2018gaming the system,\u2019\" Shafran said, \"it\u2019s utilizing the social services net as it is intended to be used.\u201d The residents of Monroe, N.Y., another town north of Manhattan where the suburbs meet rural upstate, refer to tensions between themselves and Hasidic residents by just an innocuous pair of initials: \u201cK.J.\u201d That\u2019s the acronym for Kiryas Joel, a village within Monroe that is home to one of the most concentrated communities of the Hasidic sect called Satmar. The nearly all-Hasidic village population grew so much over the last few years\u00a0 \u2013 by about 6 percent each year, with the community's average age at about\u00a0 13 -- it sought to annex hundreds of acres outside its borders to build hundreds of new units to place its residents. A decades-long battle between Monroe and K.J. ended in a referendum vote in November allowing the Hasidic village to secede, with a settlement giving it more than 200 annexed acres. \u201cWe moved here 19 years ago for more space, a perceived quality of life,\u201d \u00a0said John Allegro, a Monroe resident. \"It became an untenable situation.\u201c Watch:\u00a0Community in Conflict: Hasidic Jews and Backlash As for the Hasidim, \u201cthey have a desire and need to stay together, the women traditionally don\u2019t drive, the men have to pray together in groups of 10,\u201d said Allegro, who was part of a group of residents who brokered an agreement with K.J. officials over annexed lands. \u201cThe fact is, this packet of high-density housing in the middle of a rural and suburban community, it doesn\u2019t fit, it\u2019s a different aspiration from the way that people outside their community want to live.\u201d Isaac Abraham, advocate for Hasidic communities (Benjamin Nazario) Monroe residents saw bloc votes from Kiryas Joel and Hasidic Jews in annexed lands in town help deliver victories to candidates who represented the religious community\u2019s interests, which were diametrically opposed to their own. \u201cThey\u2019ll do what rabbis tell them to do,\u201d Heilman said. \u201cThey will because they\u2019ll get assistance.\u201d At a hearing on secession last fall in a packed auditorium in Monroe, Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus described the power struggle with Hasidic residents as \u201ca political Chernobyl that\u2019s spilling over into other towns.\u201d Recently, under pressure from his Hasidic constituents, a single state senator, Simcha Felder, held up passage of New York\u2019s $168 billion budget until he was promised the state wouldn\u2019t interfere with the educational approach of yeshivas -- despite laws requiring all students to receive an education equivalent to that of public schools. Naftuli Moster, who grew up in a Hasidic home and is one of 17 children, said that for the sake of votes, too many political leaders have turned a blind eye to the education standards at yeshivas. \"Some of the most knowledgeable and vocal opponents of the eruv are our [non-Hasidic] Jewish residents. ... No one feels they should be forced to live within the symbolic enclosure of another religious group, no matter what the religion.\" Moster calls it a near-crime that breeds high poverty levels -- particularly when combined with the large families typical in the community and the lack of academic preparation to support them. \"I find it astonishing,\" said Moster, who founded a nonprofit, Young Advocates for Fair Education, to improve ultra-Orthodox schools. \"One of the things we address is the impact on the taxpayer. A lot of people don't realize that non-public schools, even though they are called private and even if they are religious, get millions of dollars in government funding.\" \u201cThe Orthodox leaders help them get as much as possible from government programs, but what they should be doing is helping them to become self-sufficient.\" Shafran praised Felder. \u201cSimcha Felder, laudably, did what he felt he should for his constituents,\" the rabbi said. \"That\u2019s what representatives are supposed to do.\" Claims of prejudice Hasidic Jews and their supporters balk at any notions of a backlash, and accuse critics of anti-Semitic views. \"If these little towns want to putz around with racism, no problem. We have and we shall overcome them. ... They'll be running for cover, because the lawsuits will be coming.\" \u201cThese are none other than racist low-life bastards,\u201d is how Isaac Abraham, a leader in the Satmar sect in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, bluntly described the community\u2019s critics. \u201cI have no other words for them.\u201d Abraham argues that whatever the government allows in benefits, Hasidic families are \u201cdoing it legitimately.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\" said Abraham, a son of Holocaust survivors who was born in Austria and moved to Williamsburg when he was 2. \"We [hear the] claim that illegal immigrants work and they pay taxes. But they\u2019re still costing the government money and they\u2019re illegal. Here we have [Hasidic Jews] who are legal, pay taxes, were born here, so what\u2019s the problem? So you\u2019re helping him live here so he can pay your taxes.\u201d Others say that Hasidic Jews are simply tapping into a system, flaws and all, that has been used to good effect by other special interests. \"Every group looks for political clout,\" Heilman said. \"Lobbying is as American as apple pie. It's inherently corrupt, it's for special interest, not for the good of the larger society.\" Shafran countered that it is right and noble to push forward in a community's best interests. \u201cAdvocating for the needs of one\u2019s community is not corruption,\" the rabbi said. \"It is precisely what ethnic, religious and neighborhood groups are expected and encouraged to do in a democratic system.\u201d Many Hasidim say they would like to have more secular subjects, and note that girls in the community have more hours of non-religious English-language instruction and get a more well-rounded education. But many other Hasidim take offense at portrayals of their schooling as deficient. Some members of the East Ramapo Central School District Board of Education (AP) \"New York State law says that private schools must provide a substantially equivalent education to public schools,\" said Rabbi Joseph Kolakowski, whose children attend Hasidic yeshivas in Kiryas Joel and Bloomingburg, N.Y. \"My argument is that the study of Jewish religious texts are not only equivalent, but superior.\" \"The Talmud contains high-level aspects of history, science, culture, language arts, mathematics, etc.,\" Kolakowski said, \"as well as ethics, morals and critical thinking skills that are too often ignored in public schools.\u00a0 It isn't just sitting around all day singing hymns.\" To Kolakowski and many other Hasidim, the community is singled out unfairly. \"The Hasidic community is the canary in the coal mine of [the issue of] religious freedom in America,\" he said. \"There've been a lot of attacks on religious freedom against Orthodox Jews, Christians and Muslims. America was built on religious freedom.\" The larger picture Critics say it\u2019s a matter of looking at the bigger picture \u2013 that the efforts by Hasidic leaders on behalf of their communities too often come at the expense of other residents who live in the same area. Brooklyn Legal Services has complained that in this borough, Hasidic residents inundate government agencies with applications for such things as Section 8 housing the minute they become available, preventing other needy families from having access to such subsidized rentals, critics say. \u201cThey\u2019re masters of the application process,\u201d said Martin S. Needelman, the executive director of Brooklyn Legal Services. \u201cThe part that is amazing is the amount of preparation [that goes into] applications. They clear people\u2019s credit\u201d and make sure to address anything that could raise a red flag. Critics also accuse Hasidim of masking their income. Needelman said that much of the community operates in a cash economy, enabling some people to claim that their income is much less than it actually is. At the same time, he notes that a staggering number live at the poverty level, despite public assistance benefits, because of their large households. \u201cYour salary might be $40,000 or $45,000 a year, but if you have 12 children, that makes them very poor,\u201d Needelman said. Last year alone, clashes erupted in New York towns such as Monroe, East Ramapo and Bloomingburg, and in New Jersey towns including Mahwah, Jackson, Upper Saddle River and Montvale. Reasons for the friction vary: There is, for instance, the growing political power that Hasidim have gained at what others say is at the expense of the larger community. There\u2019s also the appearance of eruvs \u2013 a religious boundary sometimes fashioned out of wire affixed to utility poles -- Hasidim set up so that they where activities -- such as pushing a baby stroller or carrying canes and walkers -- may be carried out on the Sabbath, when they are not allowed to drive. \u201cAn eruv was erected on our utility poles clandestinely in the middle of the night and without the towns\u2019 permission in order to extend the size of their existing religious enclosure,\u201d said Erik Friis, a businessman who lives in Upper Saddle River, N.J., where council members recently settled with an Orthodox group that filed suit when the town demanded the removal of the religious perimeter. (Under the settlement, reports said, the group can expand its eruv through town, but it was to be rerouted as close to the New York State line as possible, and use less-obtrusive black piping, not white.) The Bergen Rockland Eruv Association argued in court documents that it secured permission from utility companies and that assertions that it acted covertly are inaccurate. \u201cWe have nobody in our three towns who wants or requires an eruv,\u201d Friis said. \u201cWhen somebody comes from another state and starts installing things that have a certain religious significance around hundreds of telephone poles without the borough\u2019s approval, and some of it was done at night, people get extremely upset. We have no forewarning of this, nor the ability to weigh in.\u201d Friis and other town opponents of the eruv argued that officials of the town, which has no Hasidic community, had capitulated to the eruv group, which asserted in a lawsuit that Upper Saddle River sought to undermine its religious freedom. \u201cSome of the most knowledgeable and vocal opponents of the eruv are our Jewish residents\u201d who aren't Hasidic, said Friis, who founded the group Citizens for a Better Upper Saddle River. \u201cA common complaint is that no one feels they should be forced to live within the symbolic enclosure of another religious group, no matter what the religion.\u201d Yehudah L. Buchweitz, who served as pro bono counsel to the Bergen Rockland Eruv Association, told Fox News the law was on the side of the Hasidic community. \u201cThe recent lawsuits in New Jersey ... ensure that families are able to enjoy the same religious freedom as so many others throughout Bergen and Rockland counties and beyond,\" Buchweitz said. \"The ... settlements preserve and protect the people\u2019s right to an eruv, which has been repeatedly endorsed by state and federal courts in every case to have considered the issue.\" \"There is an eruv in 23 of the largest 25 cities in the United States,\" he asserted. \"In almost every instance, the eruv is constructed without controversy and is viewed positively by the community as a symbol of diversity.\u201d Beware 'the next East Ramapo' Residents of many towns where Hasidic Jews have moved in say the group tends to take control of local politics and undermine the quality of life for those outside its religious enclave. The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in November against the East Ramapo, N.Y., school district and the State Department of Education alleging that the election system \u2013 controlled by Hasidic Jews \u2013 denies \u201cminority citizens an equal opportunity to have a voice in the future of their community\u2019s public schools.\u201d The district, once a high-performing one, has suffered, many residents say, since Hasidic Jews became a majority of the nine-member school board in 2005, cutting funds for public schools and diverting them to their private schools. The district cut 445 positions and reduced full-day kindergarten as well as sports and arts programs. The cuts, the NYCLU asserts, have resulted in four out of five public school children in grades three through eight lacking proficiency in math and English. The late Rabbi Mordechai Hager, who was leader of one of the largest Hasidic sects in the United States, was said to have been unhappy about Orthodox Jews who did not use public schools dominating the East Ramapo school board. The New York Times said the rabbi, whose Hasidic village, Kaser, is part of the East Ramapo school district, \"viewed the situation as unnecessarily provocative.\" \u201cHe did not believe in public confrontation with the secular world,\" Yosef Rapaport, a media consultant for Agudath Israel of America, told The Times. East Ramapo school officials didn't return calls and emails from Fox News. In towns that have fought Hasidic Jewish political power, the saying that they don\u2019t want to be \u201cthe next East Ramapo\u201d has become a familiar mantra. Some East Ramapo families, saying they're exasperated and feel powerless, have moved or plan to do so. Yolanda Maya reluctantly moved to Suffern from Spring Valley two years ago after what she said was a dip in educational quality at East Ramapo schools, particularly for special-needs students. \u201cI was there since my daughter was born,\u201d Maya said. \u201cMy daughter had only one good year; that was kindergarten. They cut programs she needed, like the integrated classes \u2013 they have special-needs children with other children in the same class. And kids with special needs really benefit from art and music programs, and they cut them.\u201d Maya said her daughter, who has learning disabilities, is gradually improving because of the resources in her new district, but that she remains scarred by the deficient education and support in East Ramapo. \u201cMy daughter used to have a healthy self-esteem,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the school system made her feel not smart, worthless.\u201d Steven White, who was educated in the district and sent his two sons there, recalls when the schools were among the best in the state. The district, he recalled, had cutting-edge programs and groomed students to qualify for the nation\u2019s best colleges. His youngest son graduated in 2012, right when the district was hit hard by deep cuts in staffing and programs. \u201cWe had a school board that was under the control of people who didn\u2019t use public schools for their own children, and who themselves had not gone to public schools,\u201d White said. Though his kids are out of the school system, White has become involved in campaigns to put people who want to strengthen public education on the school board, and he frequently went to Board of Education public meetings to voice concerns. Other former East Ramapo students, now adults, formed a group to try to bring back quality education. White said he often encountered indifference and silence when he asked questions or raised a concern. \u201cWe were treated with derision by the school board,\u201d White said. \u201cThe school budgets were always voted down; they vote in blocs. You can boil it down to the fact that they don\u2019t value public education.\" \u201cThe idea of public education is to make sure that all children are prepared for tomorrow, and we all benefit from that. The kid you educate might be the doctor that saves your life one day, or the one who creates the next great app.\u201d Isaac Abraham, an advocate for the Hasidic community, said that others should accept that the group is growing and will look out for its own best interests. He also takes exception to the idea that Hasids must explain why they live as they do. \u201cThey\u2019re not seeing what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cIf we got to their schools, from town to town, I\u2019ll give you a low number, 10 percent are on drugs, 5 percent are in the system, already as criminals. Our education system doesn\u2019t have a metal detector you have to go through, we have zero tolerance on drugs.\" With this in mind, he said, the less Hasidic kids know about the outside world, the better. \"If these little towns want to putz around with racism, no problem,\" Abraham said. \"We have and we shall overcome them. ... They'll be running for cover, because the lawsuits will be coming.\" This article has been edited since its publication earlier this week to incorporate new information and quotations.",

MARK LEVIN, HOST: Hello, America. I'm Mark Levin. This is \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" Welcome. PATRICK MICHAELS, SENIOR FELLOW IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AT THE CATO INSTITUTE: Nice to see you. LEVIN: It's a great honor to see you, Patrick Michaels, doctor. Expert on all things climate and environment, as far as I'm concerned. A little bit of your background. You're the Director of the Center for Study of Science at the Cato Institute. You hold an AB and SM, you hold those degrees in Biology, Sciences and Plant Ecology from the University of Chicago - pretty good school. PhD in Ecological Climatology from the University of Wisconsin in Madison, 1979. You're past President of the American Association of State Climatologists. You were Program Chairman for the Committee on Applied Climatology at the American Meteorological Society. Say that fast five times. MICHAELS: Yes. LEVIN: You were a Research Professor of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia for 30 years, and I'm giving an extensive background that you have. I'm giving that to the public so they that you know you really know what you're talking about. You're a contributing author and a reviewer of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. All right, let's get started. Climate change, global warming, global cooling - we've heard it all. What's going on out there? MICHAELS: Well, surface temperature of the planet is warmer than it was a hundred years ago about 9/10th of a degree Celsius. LEVIN: Nine-tenth degree of a degree Celsius. MICHAELS: That's all. LEVIN: Is that a lot? MICHAELS: No. It's not a lot. There are two periods of warning, one in the early 20th Century that could not have been caused by human beings because we hadn't put enough CO2 in the air, and one in the later part of the 20th Century that either slows down or ends depending upon whose data you use somewhere in the late 1990s, only to resume with the big El Nino that covered the news the last couple of years. So that means that probably about half, maybe half of that nine-tenths of the degree might be caused by greenhouse gases because when the planet warmed beginning in 1976, the temperature of the stratosphere started to drop and that's the prediction of greenhouse theory that's not intuitive. The great philosopher of science Karl Popper said, if you can meet a difficult prediction with your theory, you can continue to entertain your theory. So the theory is right, but the application of it is wrong. It is nowhere near as warm as it's supposed to be. The computer models are making systematic, dramatic errors over the entire tropics which is 40 percent of the earth, and it's where all our moisture comes from or almost all of it. LEVIN: Let me stop you there. Who does these computer models? MICHAELS: Governments. There are 32 families of computer models that are used by the United Nations, each government sponsored. And all of them are predicting far, far too much warming. The disparity between what's been predicted to happen, which looks like and what is happening continues to grow. LEVIN: We know that for a fact? MICHAELS: Yes, because you could just look at the weather balloon temperatures. You can look at the satellite temperatures. You can look at something called the reanalysis data. They all behave in concert. So they're showing the same thing, and the same thing is a lot different than this thing. However, we need to call the special counsel. LEVIN: A special counsel? MICHAELS: Yes, because one model works and you know what it is? It's the Russian model. LEVIN: So let me get this straight. So all the government models are like this? MICHAELS: Yes. LEVIN: The Russian model like this. MICHAELS: Yes, the Russian model has the least warming in it. LEVIN: And the Russian model has the least warming and the Russia model, pretty much follows reality that's been tested over a few decades. MICHAELS: Yes, correct. If we were rational about this, think about the daily weather forecast. You watch the Weather Channel, they go, \"Oh, this model says that, that model says that. We think this one is working the best, so we're going to rely on that.\" Well, for climate forecast, we should be using the Russian model, but we're not. We use this big spate of all the other models that have this warming in them that's not occurring. LEVIN: Why are all of these other government models, 31 of them, wrong? And why do they all go in the same direction, up? MICHAELS: Because, they are what are is called parameterized. They're all parameterized, can I translate parameterized into English? Fudged. They don't get the right answer, don't know the right answer for a certain phenomena, so we essentially put in code steps that give us what we think it should be. And the systematic error that was made was the models were tuned, yes, I said, tuned. Tuned to simulate the warming of the early 20th Century. It began in 1910, ended in 1945, about 0.45 degrees Celsius. Mark, that could not have been caused by carbon dioxide. LEVIN: Because there wasn't enough. MICHAELS: That we had to put enough in that the background carbon dioxide concentration is 280 parts per million. When the first warming started, it was 298 parts per million. If the atmosphere is that sensitive to an 18ppm change in CO2, we wouldn't be talking about this right now and we'd be sweating bullets. LEVIN: So what you're saying is man-made carbon dioxide earlier, in the last century could not have produced ... MICHAELS: The early 20th Century. LEVIN: The early 20th Century could not have produced this heat. So what did? Do we know? MICHAELS: No. And you know, the three most important words in life may not be \"I love you,\" It might be, \"I don't know.\" I don't think anybody really knows what kicked off that warming. There's lots of theories. One is that it was the final escape from a cold period, a multicentury period known as the Little Ice Age. That's a plausibility, but why did it happen then? But we just don't really have a good explanation for that, but because we forced the computer models to say, \"Aha, human influence, CO2 and other stuff.\" We made the models too sensitive, and so that's why when you get to the late 20th Century, all of a sudden they're warming up like crazy and the reality is down here. It was guaranteed to happen. This was revealed in \"Science\" magazine in late 2016, and there was a paper that was published by a French climate modeler called \"The Art and Science of Climate Model Tuning,\" and in it, he speaks of parameterizing -- we could say fudging -- the models to give, his words, an anticipated acceptable range of results. So it's the scientist, not the science that's determining how much it's going to warm. A lot of people don't know this, but it happens to be true, and you know, we could speculate as to why that paper was published right before the 2016 election? I wouldn't want to impute causation, but gee, if ... LEVIN: But I want to ask you about causation. MICHAELS: Sure. LEVIN: You have you 31 governments. MICHAELS: The 31 different models. LEVIN: All right, 31 different models. They are multiple governments. MICHAELS: Right. LEVIN: They're fudging the numbers? MICHAELS: Not fudging them, they are parameterizing. LEVIN: Okay, well, you used the word fudging. Does our EPA do that? Does NASA do that? Who does that for us? MICHAELS: Aha, good question, Mark, because the EPA was told by the Supreme Court in 2007 that if it found the carbon dioxide endangered human health and welfare, that it had the power to regulate it under the Clean Air Act. LEVIN: This is the Massachusetts. MICHAELS: That's the Mass EPA. Well, they produced an endangerment finding, 2009, and the endangerment finding for its prospective climate is 100 percent, I didn't say 90 percent, I said 100 percent based on those models. So if you can demonstrate that those models systematically are not working, you can take down the endangerment finding, and that would be the basis for all those policies that came out of the Obama administration. LEVIN: Which would mean you don't get to regulate ... MICHAELS: Absolutely. LEVIN: ... carbon dioxide. MICHAELS: Absolutely, the endangerment finding is the heart of the matter. And to give you an idea how gung-ho the Obama administration was on this issue. If you listen to his first inaugural speech, January 20, 2009. The second substantive paragraph of the speech is about global warming, after health care. Ninety days after he finished that speech, his EPA produced a preliminary finding of endangerment from carbon dioxide. They were working on this before he was President, bureaucrats can't work that fast, and then the final finding was made in December for the climate conference in Copenhagen that was supposed to produce another global warming. LEVIN: So you're telling us that we have a massive bit of public policy that has enormous effect on society that's built on - I'll use my words, phony models. MICHAELS: It's built on a house of cards. The models really don't work. And if I could really be arcane, I could explain the mechanism as to why they don't work. LEVIN: As long as I understand it. MICHAELS: The models systematically predict that as you go up in the atmosphere in the tropics which are 40% of the earth that the temperature should rise dramatically as you go further up in the atmosphere. So when you get to the level of the jet stream, the computer models are predicting seven times. I didn't say seven-tenths of a degree, I said seven times more warming than is being observed. But why is that important? Why am I boring you with that? Because the vertical distribution of temperature that determines upward motion, which means, it determines precipitation, and guess what? Almost all the atmospheric moisture that we have around us today in the humid Washington, DC, that comes from the tropics. So if you get that vertical motion wrong, down there, you get all the subsequent variables wrong. It's a fantastic systematic error, and again, that along with the difference between the surface temperatures or rather the lower atmospheric temperatures and what's being observed, that's sufficient to kill the endangerment finding. LEVIN: Okay, so to the average pedestrian like me, if you get that wrong, what does it mean? You get all the weather models wrong? MICHAELS: You get the subsequent weather wrong. That's why, if you look at all these families of models, they predict radically different changes in precipitation from model to model. Well, probably because they got the precipitation initialization out of tropics wrong. Precipitation is important. I offer you Wilmington, North Carolina as an example of precipitation. It's important coming from the tropics, get that wrong and you get that wrong. LEVIN: Is weather getting worse? MICHAELS: No. I love that question because what you really want to look at and Roger Pielke, Jr., at the University of Colorado does this. Yes, there's more damage from weather because there's more stuff and people and property in the way of weather. So what you really want to look at are weather damages as a percent of GDP. When you look at it that way, there's nothing whatsoever. I'm sure hurricanes are getting worse. I heard that on every legacy network during Florence and Harvey and all that stuff. Well, fact of the matter is, there's a guy by the name of Ryan Maui who is just a hot shot young tropical meteorologist. He is also an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and he tracks the energy in these tropical cyclones. Since we got global records that began in 1970, and you would think there would be some relationship between that integrated energy and global warming after all, it's only logical. Vice President Gore says that must be the case. It's not. There's no relationship whatsoever between the accumulated cyclone energy and the surface temperature of the earth. It's just not there Now, what - wait a minute, why does our government say this? They said it in their last report called \"Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States.\" They said, \"oh, there's been a significant increase in hurricane power in the Atlantic Ocean from like 1970 to 2009,\" or something like that, 1980 to 2009. Wait a minute. Why did you stop in 2009? It's a 2014 report. Because if you take the data after 2009, the increase goes away and back to where it was. Why did you start in the mid 1970s, because we have records that are really good back in 1920 and if you look at 1920 to 1950, you see an increase that is exactly the same as the one that occurred ... LEVIN: So the information they're providing us ... MICHAELS: It's skewed. LEVIN: It's skewed. MICHAELS: It's skewed. They're cherry picking. LEVIN: And here, we rely on the climatologists, meteorologists, and they become hyper political and I want to get back to that ... MICHAELS:L Absolutely. LEVIN: ... as soon as we return. Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, you can watch Levin TV almost every week night by going to crtv.com/mark, crtv.com/mark and sign up there or give us a call at 844-LEVIN TV, 844- LEVIN TV. We'll be right back. Dr. Patrick Michaels. The politicization of science. Let me read you something from Ayn Rand, \"Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution,\" a book of hers she wrote, which I found rather compelling. She said, \"Instead of their old promises, that collectivism would create universal abundance and their denunciations of capitalism for creating poverty. They are now denouncing capitalism for creating abundance. Instead of promising conflict, comfort and security for everyone, they are denouncing people for being comfortable and secure. The demand to restrict technology is the demand to restrict man's mind. It is nature, that is reality that makes both these goals impossible to achieve. Technology can be destroyed and the mind can be paralyzed, but neither can be restricted. Whether and whatever such restrictions are attempted, it is the mind, not the state, that withers away.\" You agree with that? MICHAELS: Yes, I do. Now, we should ask the question, how did it happen? How did we use the authority of government to direct essentially technology, energy, et cetera? How did government become so intrusive in the science process? And to do that, we have to know history. It goes back to none other than Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, at the end of World War II, saw that the Manhattan Project was going to be successful, probably. And he wrote to the director of the office that ran the project and said, \"Hey, we need to keep all these scientists working for the government. They'll do great things and everybody will have a greater life,\" and that produced a document called \"Science: The Endless Frontier,\" by Vannevar Bush which laid the blueprint for the Federal takeover of Science, prior to World War II. There was very, very little Federal money in Science except in the land grant schools, and scientific progress was perfectly fine. Economic growth, we were the envy of the world. If science is involved in developing economies, and I believe it is, we were doing really, really well. Now, when the government takes it over, the government gets what it wants and the government can give out money to basically only study the global warming via climate models. Did not take a look at climate history and to see what that really tells us, and then the government can have the policies that it wants. Because, do you expect, do you really expect scientists who have been paid for decades to study the effects of warming and to create models that by the way have too much warming, do you expect them to testify in front of Congress when asked do we need more research? They would say no, it's really a non-problem? They'd get thrown out of their jobs if they did that. And so it becomes self-perpetuating. Now global warming is a cosm, it's not a microcosm. It's a pretty big cosm -- cosmos -- in this constellation, but there are other issues that the government just abuses science onto take people's stuff, if you don't mind, and that governments distort in service of a political end. I mean, think about the dietary advice that we've been getting from the government for 20 or 30 years, turns out to be wrong. Might be associated with the epidemic of obesity and diabetes. These - when the government gets together and makes a plan and does not deviate from it, people get hurt, and that is what's happening, and Ayn Rand was right. Part of the plan was to get us off our energy stream, to get us off of oil and onto so- called renewables, renewables that don't provide nearly enough energy, and it's intermittent so that they take down the technology. What Ayn Rand was talking about is what actually happened. As a result of Roosevelt and Vannevar Bush, we created the State Science Institute. And if you remember in \"Atlas Shrugged,\" it was the State Science Institute that destroyed the innovation of the society. LEVIN: So I have an interesting paradox here, which is that you have an institution of government or several of them, which claim to be the final say in science by rejecting science, by attacking aspects of science, by climate change deniers. MICHAELS: By shading it. LEVIN: By shading it, so you actually lose knowledge, you lose science, correct? MICHAELS: Yes, that's a problem. If you say, well, they're just studying the greenhouse effect and the greenhouse effect is real and it will create some warming, so all these things, all these pronouncements that we get on diet, on whether we should exploit the world's largest copper deposit in Alaska, what the government says will have a small kernel of truth in it, and then it will be built into an artifice the size of Mount Everest from that small kernel, and that's the problem. LEVIN: I don't mean to simplify this, but who are these people? Are they ubiquitous? Are there ten of them? MICHAELS: When you buy off the academy, you can get what you paid for, and you know, when we went into the federalization of science, the academy said, \"Okay, we'll apply for your money and we're going to tack on 50% for every research application that we're going to call overhead, and that money, we, the universities, will use as we choose, and so a lot of it that the engineering and science departments generate all this revenue, probably goes to keep the dramatic language of the department to flow which does not have enough student traffic.\" So now, the academy roots for anything that is big government that it feels it can tie onto to maintain this relationship. The roots of political correctness, there are many, manifold and varied. But one of them certainly was the enslavement of the academy. LEVIN: This is a very important point, because you're not the first one I've talked to who has mentioned this and there are different fields. So the academy -- the universities and colleges -- more and more less in terms of pure science, less in terms of pure knowledge, less in terms of pure debate and so forth, more and more directional, more and more ideological. That's your point? MICHAELS: Yes, it is, and it's not just in climate change. In fact, I am just completing a book manuscript that looks more than climate change, it looks at diet, it looks at drug policy, the opioid war and all these good things. It's called \"Scientocracy,\" and I think that's what we have developed in this country. And you know, there are things we can do about it, but this has to be a public will, and the public is so scientifically misinformed that it becomes a very, very heavy lift, doesn't it. LEVIN: One fact, it becomes very political, doesn't it? In other words if you don't believe in climate change and you can't even explain it, you don't know what it means, you don't know where it comes from, you don't know why it exists, but you know as a political matter, you better believe in it or you're a denier like a holocaust denier. MICHAELS: Right. LEVIN: We'll be right back. LAUREN GREEN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Lauren Green. New images show the last time \"Washington Post\" columnist Jamal Khashoggi was seen alive. Pictures from Turkish state television show him entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month. The Saudis have now admitted he is dead saying he was killed in a brawl inside the consulate. Turkish media also reporting that Khashoggi's fiancee is now under police protection. The report however did not elaborate why. An investigation is under way after a floor collapsed during a party at a clubhouse near Clemson University in South Carolina. The floor caved as people were dancing injuring some 30 people as they fell into the basement below. Some were treated in hospitals but none of the victims received life-threatening injuries. I'm Lauren Green, now back to \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" LEVIN: Dr. Michaels, everybody says this global warming, it's a terrible thing. The oceans are going to rise, we just talked about this. The hurricanes are going to be more intense and so forth, and you're saying not really. Well, we never talk about this, are there benefits from some increased heat on the planet? MICHAELS: Yes, the whole philosophy here is straight out of Voltaire. You know, Pangloss and the best of all possible worlds, we don't live in the best of all possible climates. And our atmosphere is not in the best of all possible composition. So what's happened as it's warmed this half a degree in the late 20th Century and the CO2 has gone up and up in the atmosphere, well, what we've done is we've created a greener and greener planet and the greening of the planet earth is profound. There's a very recent paper that just came out a couple of months ago, showing tremendous increases in how much green matter there is on the planet. LEVIN: Vegetation. MICHAELS: Vegetation. The largest increases by the way are in the tropical rainforest. It's growing like topsy. LEVIN: Is that why we never hear about it anymore? MICHAELS: I don't know why we don't hear about it anymore, but it sure is growing, and in grassland, which is lot of it is used for agriculture either ... LEVIN: Prairies. MICHAELS: Prairies that cows either go on or we harvest it for hay, the data for 17 years of satellite data show the grassland, green mass, if you will, is growing at 5% per year. That's huge. Another paper, \"Nature\" magazine by Ziaxen Ju (ph) two years ago looked at the planetary greening and said what are the causes? He did something called a factor analysis. Seventy percent of it was a simple direct effect of putting more carbon dioxide in the air because it's plant food. And one of the other big causes of the planetary greening was climate change, the warming of the planet. Yes, we never hear about this, but it's real. LEVIN: So even though it's warming just a little bit, it has an enormous positive impact on the planet. MICHAELS: Because the main reason for that is because the way the greenhouse changes work is they warm the coldest temperatures preferentially to warming the warmer ones, so the growing season, which ends with the first frost in autumn and begins with the last frost in the spring, the growing seasons get longer and longer and longer, the greenhouse effect also affects nighttime temperatures more than it affects daytime temperatures, that's when the cold temperatures are. So you have a longer time for the planet to green up and then you have longer growing seasons and you have the direct fertilization of carbon dioxide which is even more important than the climate change itself, and you're winding up with a much greener planet. I've looked at these numbers. I can tell you that the amount of agricultural productivity that is now being induced in the planet by CO2 particularly in these grassland areas is going to provide a lot of our food for our future. LEVIN: You know, it gets a little confusing frankly, the politics and the logic of all this, that is, you would think if a tiny little bit of increase in heat and it comes and goes, right? I mean, that's the way the nature works, that's how the planet functions, would be so beneficial, that we wouldn't be trying to regulate the hell out of it, we would pretty much just leave it alone. MICHAELS: Well, you would think, but unfortunately, like we talked about early in the program, if we parameterize the models to produce large amounts of heat in the 21st Century, then we're going to say it's all bad and we're going to try to, if you will, de-technologize. LEVIN: When did all this start? When did all of this propaganda, the fake stuff ... MICHAELS: When it all started? I'll tell you when it started. It started in the late 1970s when a group of folks that I know decided that they wanted nuclear power, and they decided that Carter, who sold himself as a nuclear engineer, he was actually a technician on a submarine, that Carter was favorable to this, so that if they pushed the issue of global warming as a catastrophe, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, that could lead to the nuclearization of the country. That's when it started, and it spun out of control because the green allies who wanted us, the fossil fuel thing gone, they didn't want nuclear power. They're dramatically opposed to nuclear power. So they pushed solar energy and windmills. Now we get an unreliable grid and expensive electricity. It actually has a history. It happened. It was an international movement that started out in Sweden with Bert Bolin who was the first head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and it was a very conscious plan to impose this not just on our society but the world. LEVIN: What is this de-growth, de-industrialization movement? Is it sort of part of this massive progressive movement or even worse, socialism or Marxism or anything of that sort. I've studied, I've written about it, I've read about it, it's really kind of got born in Europe and was exported to the United States? MICHAELS: That is true, and the problem with it is that it enjoys broad support as long as you demonize the producers of energy. We should celebrate the producers of energy. It is energy that drives the technology that has doubled our life expectancy in the last 100 years. We should be celebrating this. And if you take this away, you're going to take that away too. LEVIN: Don't forget, folks, almost every week night, you can you join me on Levin TV, Levin TV, go to crtv.com/mark, crtv.com/mark or give us a call at 844-LEVIN-TV. 844-LEVIN-TV. We'll be right back. At the top of the show, we went through your biography a little bit, and you worked for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change at the UN. I don't know a lot about it, know a little about it, written a little about it, but it was sort notoriously corrupt intellectually as I understood it, tell us about that. MICHAELS: Well, the IPCC as it's called is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The United Nations is trying to tell you something there, it wants the governments of the world to have a unified view, and therefore a unified policy on climate change. That's what it was there for. Now, I was asked to write a small portion of second report. I've reviewed the other ones and people said, \"Why did you work for IPCC?\" Well, fact of the matter is that all garden parties need a skunk. And there were a few skunks there. The skunks eventually kind of dropped out because they tend to get so disgusted with it. But we got our two cents in and then, as you know, it's simply kind of run away with the issue, and all these documents that are produced like the IPCC documents, the US national assessment on climate change, they're summaries of scientific literature. Now, the problem is the scientific literature, itself, has to be biased, because we are working, we are funding the hypothesis that climate change is this horrible thing. It has all of these horrible effects and you don't get your grant renewed unless you publish and so that literature that you summarize is biased in a given direction. That's how we get on policy did. Did some people sit in a room and say, wow, this is how we'll do this? I don't know. But it might have happened. LEVIN: The UN is notoriously anti-capitalism and high sovereignty, national sovereignty and so forth. Naomi Wolf once said, a leftist activist, obviously, that really, it's the environment, climate change, all these issues, through which we're going to change the capitalist society. MICHAELS: Correct. LEVIN: Is that what's taking place? MICHAELS: They're trying. They certainly had a block in the road that occurred, a bump in the road that occurred a couple of years ago. LEVIN: What happened? MICHAELS: Well, we got a President that wasn't going for it, and he promised to get out of the Paris Accord on Climate Change, that's an agreement that was hatched in December of 2015, in which the nations of the world submit what are called voluntary plans to reduce their emissions. So, for example, we volunteered to reduce our emissions at pretty substantial percentage. The Indians volunteered to increase their emissions, the Chinese volunteered to increase their emissions until 2030 whereupon they might level off. So the president looked at that and he says, this is a bad deal. What I just told you, doesn't that sound like a bad deal? LEVIN: Yes . MICHAELS: And he got out of it. Meanwhile, what country on earth reduced its emissions the most? Of all the nations on earth? The US of A. LEVIN: So this would have formalized an agreement where we're compelled to lower and the Chinese and the Indians could increase? MICHAELS: Yes. Now, the thing - but nobody is compelled. There's no enforcement mechanism in the Paris Accord. So when our negotiator, John Kerry came back and was on the Sunday TV shows, he said, well how are you going to enforce this? What are you going to do countries that don't do what they said they were going to do? He said, \"We'll shame them.\" Honest to God, I guess we have a shame bomb now and that's going to do something. Of course, emissions are going up. LEVIN: Why have we lowered our? MICHAELS: We have lowered ours largely because of good old capitalism and technology, discovering that we were not running out of natural gas, that if we just break rocks underneath our feet, we can extract the natural gas from shale. LEVIN: Fracking. MICHAELS: Fracking, that's right. And so we're substituting natural gas which is cheaper for coal for electrical generation, and that produces about half as much CO2 per unit electricity as a coal plant does, and so our emissions are going down, and I see a lot of big companies are experimenting with natural gas for large scale transportation. You can do to on a railroad because the size of the engine doesn't matter. It might be able to do it in trucks, so the emissions, it's more efficient, the emissions go down and then 30 or 40 years from now, because there are so many pressures to be efficient, I don't know what technology we will have, but I'll bet it will be more efficient. The old advertising slogans, the future belongs to the efficient, well, welcome to the United States. LEVIN: We'll be right back. Dr. Patrick Michaels, why does the media do such a lousy job in reporting basic information like you're explaining to us right now? MICHAELS: Well, the end of the world sells, look at the ratings for the Weather Channel every time there is even a modest hurricane, and if you are predicting and projecting global weather and climate Armageddon, people are going to tune in, and even if it doesn't happen, the way it's supposed to, well, you don't have to report that, do you? You don't have to report that the climate models are predicting way too much tropical warming and all that good stuff. No, you can just keep on going as you will. There's a niche, though, I've often thought of this. Wouldn't there be a market for a good weather channel that just had pictures of the beach and bright sunny days with advertisers Anheuser-Busch and Viagra, it would work, I'm sure. LEVIN: There's an opening right there. MICHAELS: Yes. LEVIN: But it's a great disservice, I see this across the board in a lot of cultural, social, scientific issues, where the free press doesn't provide information. Doesn't provide facts. It provides ideologically pushed policies. And this is particularly troublesome to me in this area because there's a lot of correcting that needs to be done, so it's politicized. It becomes an ideological movement. We talk about people want to raise objections to it. You. You've come under a barrage of assaults as I've seen. MICHAELS: It's not very pretty. LEVIN: Not very pretty, simply because you say wait a minute, I have different information that shows something else. What's it like? MICHAELS: It's not fun, but it must be enough fun that I continue to keep on doing it. The problem is that a lot of the journalistic profession, a lot of people go into it because they're idealistic, they want to change the world, and my God, here's an issue that affects the energy structure of our society, which really affects our society and I can be involved in this? So they form pressure groups or internal lobbying groups like the Society of Environmental Journalists. LEVIN: I didn't know there was one? MICHAELS: Oh, yeah, they're very powerful within the profession, and enforces a speech line. There are certain things you don't say, there are certain things you say. And they have annual conferences where the lights of issues like climate change come and give them lectures about the end of the world. So it's a self-feeding process and it's an institution. LEVIN: Is the EPA a good agency or a bad agency? When you hear about it, you say, well, clean air, clean water, saves the polar bears, but do they fear, over regulate and make progress that much more difficult? MICHAELS: The polar bears are saving themselves. They're growing in numbers. The EPA was the outgrowth of the early environmental movement in the United States. It was created by Richard Nixon, and by the way, the air in some of our air sheds was crap. LEVIN: By the way, we're going to finish with this when we come back. We'll be right back. The EPA started under Nixon, what are your thoughts about? MICHAELS: We had a lot of work to do when it started out. We had really serious air quality problems in the country and the EPA did a great job with that. It tried - it succeeded in controlling sulfur and nitrogen oxides that came out of power plants, acid rain and all that good stuff. But unfortunately, like most bureaucracies, one of the easy low hanging fruit are the things you get and then you start to get more arcane, but your bureaucracy is embedded and then the agency takes on a life of its own and that's what has happened. Can it be fixed? Yes, it could be. We could take a look at the endangerment finding from carbon dioxide and see how scientifically well supported or non-supported it is. I think that would go a long way. And then, we would have a much more sensible policy. We would not be shooting ourselves in the energy foot like we are and we would continue to maintain our society at higher level. LEVIN: True enough. Problem is when you have people who are embedded in these agencies who are not willing to do as you say or ideologically driven, or are there for decades and have, as you say, their agenda - and they are going to drive their agenda, this becomes a huge problem. Let me tell you, it's been a great pleasure. MICHAELS: Yes, it was great fun. LEVIN: All right, thanks very much.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to \"Hannity.\" All right. The American left, the mainstream media, they will stop at nothing to malign the presidency of Donald J. Trump. Night after night, these attacks on the president and everybody who supports him, they are vicious, they're absurd, and at this point, it's psychotic. And right here on \"Hannity\" we've been onto this game all along. We've been calling out o for years. And what you've witnessed in the last 48 hours is the latest example of the left's anti-Trump echo chamber, propaganda, all in an attempt to hurt his presidency, delegitimize the election, and really undermine the vote of the American people. Now, in moments, we're going to expose all the political hacks who pretend to be so fair and unbiased, the so-called \"journalists\". We'll also show you also the media's best friends in the Democratic Party, they are playing politics with the safety and security of our country at the southern border. And the midterm elections are now fast approaching. The left, they have no plan to improve America. And, by the way, they are in full gear trying to discredit your vote, your agenda, your beliefs, and your economy. All right. Stay tuned, buckle up, it's time for tonight's very important breaking news opening monologue. (MUSIC) HANNITY: All right. Tonight, we're going to start with a \"Hannity\" history lesson. Way back in 2015, when Donald Trump, remember, descended from the escalator at Trump Tower, he announced his candidacy for the presidency of the United States. These so-called \"elites\" in this country -- they were laughing in his face. They said it couldn't happen, please, please run. And, of course, Trump went on to prove them all wrong. And despite the media's best efforts to trash then-candidate Trump, laugh at his agenda, he energized the American people. He won the Republican primary, went on to resoundingly defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election. This wasn't their plan. This was not supposed to happen. And on the election night, you may remember, 2016, your corrupt mainstream media, America's holier-than-thou so-called \"journalists\" -- they had a collective depression and meltdown all on television. You might remember. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC, NOV. 9, 2016: America is crying tonight. I'm not sure how much of America, but a very, very significant portion. I mean, literally crying. This is a sadness. It is a mourning moment for those people, and it is a moment filled with fear, filled with fear. RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC, NOV. 9, 2018: Our country is about to face some serious crises. And so, buckle up. Your country needs you. MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC NEWS, NOV. 8, 2016: Pretty extraordinary thing to say. If you have a son in the Marine Corps and you don't trust the commander-in-chief. People in the military defend the constitution. VAN JONES, CNN, NOV. 8, 2016: This was a white-lash. This was a white-lash against a changing country. It was a white-lash against a black president, in part. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: All right. From that point on, it has totally gotten worse. They are hell-bent on discrediting this presidency, your vote. The media turned into nothing but an anti-Trump nonstop echo chamber. And for them, every issue of the day is a full-blown crisis. The smoking gun, a national embarrassment, they literally parrot each other in their talking points until the rhetoric reaches a fever pitch. Remember this freak out over the president's use of the word -- hole? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) DON LEMON, CNN: What was your reaction of the president calling African nations (EXPLETIVE DELETED) holes? FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN: It's not clear what he meant by (EXPLETIVE DELETED) hole countries. LEMON: Are you shocked or surprised by this? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not surprised. In one way, I'm proud. I am a proud (EXPLETIVE DELETED)-holer. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, we are not all created equal. At least not if you are born in, as the president put it, a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) hole country. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: The word house instead of hole. As in (EXPLETIVE DELETED) countries, not (EXPLETIVE DELETED) countries. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I guess he is a (EXPLETIVE DELETED)-holer. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: Fake news CNN, now known as a ssh-hole network, they have been so obsessed, we could've played that montage for a full hour or longer. And, of course, the media's echo chamber didn't stop there. They have been obsessed from day one, the day he came down the escalator, the so-called \"news gatherers\", widely speculating about and obsessing about the president's mental health. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) BRIAN STELTER, CNN: President Trump's fitness for office is the top story in the country. Reporters and some lawmakers are openly talking about the president's mental stability, his health, his competency. JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: One of the people closest to Donald Trump in the campaign saying he's got early stage of dementia. He repeats the same stories over and over again. His father had it, and it's getting worse, and not a single person who works for him doesn't know he has early signs of dementia. KATY TUR, NBC: Can you assess the president's mental fitness for office? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The president appeared to slur his words while giving an address. Did you look into what the cause of that might've been at all? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you ruling out things like early onset Alzheimer's? Are you looking at dementia-like symptoms? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On what basis would you, and this is just a philosophical question, advise the Cabinet, if the president is unable to discharge his duties? (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: They move from crisis to crisis, hysteria, hysteria, hysteria. Then they move on to the next one. Then it became Stormy, Stormy, Stormy, all the time. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) APRIL RYAN, CNN: This could be the last nail in the coffin. Stormy Daniels is causing stormy weather. JAKE TAPPER, CNN: Porn star Stormy Daniels claims President Trump broke the law, had her bullied. LEMON: Does Stormy Daniels have the president's number? It sure seems that way. TAPPER: President Trump might have met his match with Stormy Daniels. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How is Stormy weathering this? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stormy speaks! WOLF BLITZER, CNN: We are hearing quite a bit from Stormy Daniels. LEMON: Stormy, in her own words, isn't going anywhere. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Stormy Daniels has a good lawyer. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Porn star Stormy Daniels was telling the truth. LEMON: Stormy Daniels is on a tear. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: Every second, every day, hysteria, crisis, crisis, hysteria. Just another way to trash the president and discredit we, smelly Walmart people that cling to our gods, guns, bibles, religion and, you know, we are all irredeemable deplorables. And, of course, their favorite topic, when all else fails, let's go back to Russia, Russia, Russia. Almost two years of this nonsense. It's like a moth drawn to a flame, they cannot help themselves. The past 48 hours is one more example. Take a look. All right. And always, the media bolsters this rhetoric by trotting out pro-Obama, pro-Hillary Clinton, former deep state officials to thrash Trump, all in an attempt to legitimize their hyperbole. That includes the disgraced fired FBI director, James Comey. Remember, he doesn't watch this show, or even really know who I am, he said that on his book tour. Well, we all know Jim Comey is a liar. He said this in an interview with ABC7 in New York's Bill Ritter. And then, by the way, he attacked me and Tucker just yesterday. But I thought he never watched. And yesterday he tweeted, quote: This Republican Congress has proven incapable of fulfilling the founders design that ambition must counteract ambition. Well, all who believe in this country's values must vote for Democrats this fall. Policy differences don't matter right now. History has its eyes on us. Yes, Jim, we've been watching you. In other words, Republicans won't turn their backs on the leader of their party, President Trump, so it's time to vote all of them out because Jim Comey doesn't want the investigation to continue. We're going to have a full montage of all these high-ranking former deep state officials trashing Trump later in the show. But why would he ever trust political hacks in the intel community that abuse their power? It's first important to call out what is a blatant double standard. Despite what you see and hear from this bubble media echo chamber, President Trump and his peace through strength Russia policy has been so incredibly tougher than that of Obama, who they worshiped and adored in the media. In an interview today, once again, the president reaffirming America's commitment to combat Russia's hostile actions. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFF GLOR, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: You say you agree with U.S. intelligence agents that Russia meddled in the election in 2016. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I've said that before, Jeff. I've said that numerous times before. And I would say that that is true, yes. GLOR: But you haven't condemned Putin, specifically. Do you hold him personally responsible? TRUMP: Well, I would, because he is in charge of the country, just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country. So, certainly, as the leader of a country, you have to hold him responsible, yes. GLOR: What would you say to him? TRUMP: Very strong on the fact that we can't have meddling, we can't have any of that. Now, look, we are also living in a grown-up world, really a strong statement -- you know, President Obama supposedly made a strong statement, nobody heard it. What they did here is the statement that he made to Putin's very close friend, and that statement was not acceptable. Didn't get very much play relatively speaking, but that said, it was not acceptable. But I let him know we can't have this. We are not going to have it, and that's the way it's going to be. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Yes, the president is right. Vladimir Putin is a hostile actor. Russia is a hostile regime. What you saw, by the way, is something he has said over and over again, although your media is acting like this is the first time. It's not the first time that he talks about their interference, and their meddling. As a matter fact, he has said it over and over again. It's true, and facts matter. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, but I think we also got hacked by other countries and other people. And I can say that, you know, when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary, that was probably China. We have much hacking going on. Well, I think it was Russia and I think it could've been other people and other countries. It could've been a lot of people interfering. I think it was Russia, but I think it was probably other people and/or countries. It was Russia, and I think it was probably others, also. The Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever. But, certainly, there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: You mean he said it all before? They never reported that. All right. Look at his actions, by the way. Look at his policies, in this particular case, in dealing with Russia. Just look at it. After taking office, President Trump authorized the lethal arms deal with Ukraine in order to deter Russia's aggressive actions in the region. Why didn't Obama do that? That's a move against the wishes of Vladimir. And compare that to Obama in 2009, he actually killed a plan that would have armed our Eastern European allies with missile defense systems. Could've prevented all of that. A move praised by Putin as correct and brave. No hysteria over Obama's relationship with Putin, I'll have more flexibility in my next term. First month in office, President Trump extended broad economic sanctions against Putin, against Russia. More recently, he issued new stinging sanctions against multiple Putin-linked Russian oligarchs and companies. Compare that to Obama's first year in office where they embarrassingly, you know, tried to reset Russian relationships with a big present and everything. It didn't work out. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: I wanted to present you with a little gift, which represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying, that is, we want to reset our relationship. So, we will do it together. (LAUGHTER) SERGEI LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Thank you very much. CLINTON: You are very welcome. We worked hard to get the right Russia word. Did we get it? LAVROV: You got it wrong. CLINTON: I got it wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: It looks like a nuclear firing button. Where was the media five- alarm fire over that embarrassing love fest that never worked out, by the way? And don't forget when Obama did literally nothing to counteract Putin's involvement in Syria. It was Donald Trump who launched air strikes against the Assad regime, authorized the counteract on Russian soldiers on the ground in Syria resulting in hundreds of Russian casualties. Obama drew a redline, then they crossed over it, and he did nothing. The media is hysterical over the president's, well, so-called friendly relationship with Putin. Compared to Obama's? OK. On last night's program, the great one, Mark Levin, put all this hysteria in great perspective. It's worth repeating. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK LEVIN, RADIO HOST: In 1945, at the Yalta Conference, Franklin Roosevelt sold out half of Europe to Stalin. He repeatedly praised Stalin. In 1961, JFK met with Khrushchev. JFK told a friend of his that he was rolled over, that he came across weak, that it was pretty disastrous, his meeting with Khrushchev. In 1975, Gerald Ford in Helsinki with Brezhnev, 35 other countries, recognized the territorial sovereignty of the Soviet Union, which included the captive nations of Eastern Europe. In 1979, Jimmy Carter placed a big, wet kiss on Brezhnev's cheek in Vienna. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: So, like we have been saying for months, since Donald Trump came down the escalator, since he said he is running for president, what we're seeing from the left and their allies in the media is nothing more than a huge, massive, blatant political tactic. Now, this is especially true as we now gear up for the 2018 midterms. I'm telling you, the Democratic Party -- they have no plan, no solutions to improve the country, to help the people of this country. Instead, their agenda is purely political. They just want their power back. They want their crumbs back, the tax cuts. They want to impeach Donald Trump, but don't say it. They want to keep Obamacare, keep your doctor, plan and pay less, that didn't work out. They don't want Judge Kavanaugh to be confirmed to the Supreme Court, and, of course, they want open borders. But their political tactics are all too blatant. No solutions. Recently, House Democrats even authorizing a bill to abolish ICE. They want to show how in favor of open borders they really are. Even top House Democrat, Keith Ellison, even claiming today that our borders are \"an injustice.\" really? And the Democrat's new rising star in New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, even vowed to occupy ICE offices and borders everywhere. I'm not making this up. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: I believe the moral character of the United States is at stake. So, for me, it wasn't a question of whether I should go down there. We have to have a rapid response, I think every day that we go on, especially a day when something that heinous happens, we have to occupy all of it. We need to occupy every airport, we need to occupy every border, we need to occupy every ICE office until those kids are back with their parents, period. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And meanwhile, earlier, so during a House resolution determining congressional support for ICE, well, 133 Democrats went all-in Obama and just voted present. As you can see, Democrats are happy to play politics with your border security. They don't want their actions written down on paper as official record. They know they are wrong, they know it's politically at odds with the American people, but they want to play politics because this is all about them getting their power back at all costs. Now, without a doubt, 2018 is now the single most important midterm election in our lifetime. Democrats, the media, their allies in the deep state, they are going to get more hysterical, all in their continuing efforts to delegitimize the president, and your agenda, and your vote, and your support for the president. We know this game, it's too familiar, their tactics. We all know the truth. The United States is seeing the best GDP growth we've seen since before Obama. We now have historically low unemployment rates all across the board, 14 state records with women in the workforce, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans. Literally, the U.S. pulled out of the horrible Iranian deal that Obama got us in because of his weakness. Yes, he is the only president to promise Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel and keep it. He is leading with peace through strength all over the world. The left wants to go back to what? The old days of weakness? Appeasement? Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps? Eight million more in poverty. Really? We want to go back to doubling the debt. We want to go back to economic -- the only president to ever hit 3 percent GDP in his life? Are you kidding me? We now went from the lowest labor participation in history to the highest. I mean, with each passing day, this country is improving on all fronts. We know that the agenda is succeeding, with or without the support of these elites in the media. These corrupt, biased, abusively biased, hysterical reporters that are agenda-driven. This isn't news anymore. It's fake news. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor, investigative Sara Carter, the author of \"Why We Fight,\" Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. You know, add to that, Sara, this is their playbook. They have their five agenda items, and to get there, they are going to do what they always do with the support of the media. Republicans are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic. They want dirty air and water. They want children to die. And they want to throw grandma over the cliff. So, it's all the same thing. Nothing is going to improve the lives of the American people. Here is my question, does the shrill, so-called \"fake news,\" not so-called, it is fake news, so-called news, does it -- does it win the day? Do they have an ability to sway the American people with these stories that they gin up the way they do? SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I certainly think they expect the American public. They affect our discourse when they write these type of stories, when they produce these types of pieces that we know are false narratives, based on, you know, what the establishment wants out there. Sean, all you have to do is look at how James Comey, former FBI Director James Comey, Brennan, put Hayden in there, these are establishment RINOs as well as people on the left that are working contrary to the American people and the American agenda. Look at what Comey said today. He came out and said, well, if you don't vote Democrat, I mean, if you are an American, you've got to vote Democrat. What kind of person says this? The FBI director should be ashamed of himself. He should be ashamed that he ran the bureau culturally into the ground. That agents have suffered because of the way he handled things. Director Brennan did the same thing, calling President Trump treasonous. I mean, it's just false and on its face. But instead, Brennan is bordering sedition. So, these are problems -- HANNITY: These are true -- because I have sources telling me that Brennan was actually spreading the phony dossier. CARTER: I have been in contact and I wanted to let you know, I've been in contact with Brennan's people. I have spoken with them today. I was told that Brennan is standing by his word that he did not know anything about the content of the dossier until December, 2016. Now, he did hear about the dossier, according to people that I've spoken with, and I find it hard to believe that although reporters all over Washington, D.C. knew about this dossier, that the CIA director knew nothing about it. HANNITY: Yes, the CIA didn't. Not so sure. CARTER: So I have to stick with what I've been told. But that's -- HANNITY: I think we are going to find the CIA director that is so radical and political now, Dr. Gorka, that he was radical and political during the campaign, as well. That becomes a big problem for him, doesn't it? DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: I think Sara's point, Sean, is incredibly important. Never, never in the history of the FBI has a director been fired for cause, and then within a year, he is making public statements about who Americans should vote for in the next election. Never before, ever, since the CIA was created after World War II have we had a former CIA director make seditious statements in calling the president a traitor publicly. This is absolutely outrageous. These people should -- HANNITY: I think he is feeling the heat. Oh, I think he's up to his eyeballs in this deep state garbage. I think the media has been played by him and his radical views, voting communist, never left him. (CROSSTALK) GORKA: Yes, I mean, think of it, 1976, 19 -- you vote for the communist party in 1976? That's just 14 years after the Cuban missile crisis. That's the height of the Cold War. HANNITY: All right. Last word, Sara. Yes, Sara, last word. CARTER: Well, Sean, this is why it's so important that the oversight committees be allowed to continue conducting their investigation, that the Department of Justice turn over the documentation that was requested so that the American people actually know what happened here. This is extraordinarily dangerous to the republic and to our country and to the foundation our country was built on. We've got to know the truth. GORKA: The most important question, why did Crossfire Hurricane start? That's the most important question. Who started it? HANNITY: All right, guys. Good question. When we come back, Congressman Steve Scalise has very strong feelings. Also, Gregg Jarrett. And a lot more breaking news straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. On Monday, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise took to Twitter to defend President Trump. And Congressman Scalise wrote, President Donald Trump went into this meeting with Putin from a position of American strength to combat Russian aggression. But it's important to remember how Russia was allowed to get to this point. He then gave a timeline of all of Obama administration's failures with Russia, starting with a reset. He joins us now, the House majority whip, Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise. Why don't you just go through this, because I didn't want to put it in my HANNITY history lesson because I thought you did a good job, but I did show Hillary with that silly reset button of hers. REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA., HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: And don't forget the cackle. Sean, great to be back with you. Look, there were so many different things that Barack Obama did when he was president. You know, he mocked Mitt Romney in that 2012 debate saying, you know, the '80s want their foreign policy back when Romney said Russia is a big threat. The redline was probably one of those glaring points where he truly did go backwards in terms of strength, when he literally put that redline and said, Syria, you know, you've got to do these things, don't gas your own people, and, of course, after Syria gassed their own people, he sat back and let it go. When the Ukraine -- I mean, you're talking about good friends of ours, allies of America were being invaded, President Obama sat by and did nothing. And Ukrainians, by the way, were asking the Obama administration, not for boots on the ground, but just for weapons to defend themselves. And he turned his back on them. President Trump, by the way, in contrast, gave the Ukrainian missiles, gave them the ability to stand up to Russia. President Trump has stood up to Russia on a number of fronts. Obviously, that was one, expelling diplomats, President Trump increased sanctions, he worked with us in Congress to increase sanctions against Russia. So, there's a big contrast between President Obama just ignoring -- HANNITY: Well, it's just like the president said it many times, yes, Russia did it. Yes, they meddled. Yes, they interfered. It's sort of like, the left, if you're not backing up the Brinks truck and trying to bribe some kind of despot or dictator, if you're not making meaningless lines in the sand that you never have any intention of backing up, if you show weakness and if you appease, they like that. Donald Trump didn't give a dime. SCALISE: Keep in mind, Sean -- yes, keep in mind the meddling, the actual meddling in the election happened under President Obama's watch. HANNITY: Exactly. SCALISE: He was president. There is evidence that he knew something that was going on, he just didn't do anything because they thought Hillary was going to win. So, you look at what President Trump has done, he's acknowledged there was meddling. We, by the way, and Chairman Nunes and his committee have done a great job, you pointed out, but Devin Nunes and his committee showed there was meddling, but there was no collusion between either campaign, and the meddling didn't have anything to do to change the outcome of the election. We should still pursue it, and we are, but the meddling itself actually happened under Barack Obama's watch. HANNITY: All right. Congressman, glad we have a few strong Republicans there who are willing to actually tell truth and give a proper history. Thank you for being one of them. Here now for more reaction, the author of, yes, it's out Monday, \"The Russian Hoax: Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\" It comes out Monday, Fox News Legal Analyst, Gregg Jarrett. You know, one of the things that we're watching is a lot of these people that are most critical, the Comey's, the Brennan's, and the, you know, all of these people, Clappers that are now paid, you know, in their case it all happened under their watch, didn't it? GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: It did. Absolutely. And you know, this notion that President Trump has been soft on Putin and Russia is belied by the facts. He has increased debilitating sanctions against Russia, and Putin fivefold in the short 18 months since he's taken office, far more than Obama did in eight years. He has targeted their energy industry, their defense industry, his inner circle, Putin's inner circle, frozen assets, close down diplomatic properties, and expelled numerous Russian diplomats. He is applying pressure-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: But Gregg-- JARRETT -- at the right time against a military and strategic adversary, and at the same time, he sees the bigger picture. He's extending an olive branch to try to diffuse long-term tensions with an adversary that has nuclear weapons aimed at us. HANNITY: Clear Hillary Clinton, she committed felonies instead of Donald Trump, frame Donald Trump. That whole Russian phony dossier she paid for, foreign national, funneled money. Literally, the bulk of the FISA applications to spy on the Trump campaign. That's all Russian liars. JARRETT: Yes. HANNITY: That's all that she paid for. Why is -- how is it possible the media can feign such outrage here, and ignore the biggest abuse of power in an attempt to literally impact a presidential election, clearly against the will of the American people? JARRETT: Because the media were constant apologists for Hillary Clinton, and they hate Donald Trump. They are visceral scorn, an unabashed hatred is apparent for all to see every day. The great irony, as you point out, is that it was Hillary Clinton who was colluding with foreign nationals and paying money in a political campaign which is a crime, yet she is not investigated. Trump didn't do that, and yet, he is the subject of a dilating investigation to try to destroy his presidency. HANNITY: All right. The book is out Monday, Amazon.com, Hannity.com. Gregg Jarrett, great work. This will be the defining book on the whole issue. It will blow rightly lays it all out for the American people. Highly researched, footnoted. All right. Still to come, the great Joe DiGenova and Monica Crowley. And House intelligence committee chairman, Devin Nunes says the Democrats, the DOJ is delaying hoping the Democrats win, and then they won't have to tell us the truth. We will get to that straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. President Trump's reluctance to trust the quote, \"intel community\" becomes easier to understand when you do consider the bosses of our intel agencies. Not his intel, the ones before him. They've been out to destroy him since day one, and since they left, since before he got elected, and after he got elected. Watch what we mean. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER UNITED STATES DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: He is aiding and abetting our arch adversary, and has failed, in my mind, to live up to his constitutional obligations and responsibilities. JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER UNITED STATES CIA DIRECTOR: What Mr. Trump did yesterday was to betray the men and women of the FBI, the CIA, NSA, and others. And to betray the American public. And that's why I use the terms that this is nothing short of treasonous because it is a betrayal of the nation. He is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When do we see a shadow government come out and say, we cannot side with the government whether it's the cabinet or the Senate. I think that's the biggest question. LEON PANETTA, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: This president basically coddled Mr. Putin. And it was clear that he was intimidated by that situation. Whether the Russians have something on this president or not, no one really knows. But, the way he behaves, there is a clear signal that the Russians have something on him. MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA & NSA DIRECTOR: That's the scene where families were separated. Now look, I know we're not Nazi Germany, all right? But there is a commonality there, and a fear on my part. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: If that's not enough to make the point, remember when Senator Chuckie Schumer actually said, don't ever mess with the intel community. Like never mess with them. MADDOW: Taking these shots this antagonism-- SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: Yes. MADDOW: -- this taunting to the intelligence community. SCHUMER: Let me tell you. If you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday from getting back at you. So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he is being really dumb to do this. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. Here with reaction, former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe DiGenova, conservative columnist, Monica Crowley. You know, I told you, Joe, a while back, when you say bad cops, these were bad cops, because 99 percent of cops are good cops that do a lot of good, and that goes for the CIA and the intel community. Now I look at a guy like Brennan, it happened on his watch, I think he probably knew all about the dossier. His involvement in this is going to be very interesting. Do we really want to live in a country where the Senate leader on the Democratic side says you better not ever say anything bad about the intel community? Because they'll -- they'll get you. JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, COLUMBIA: Sean, I want to talk about two people. We only have so much time. John Brennan and Leon Panetta. John Brennan is a traitor, and I'll tell you why. He is the real traitor. What he did and what he has had recently about the president of the United States is despicable. He is personally responsible for the leaking of unmasked information, he was responsible for the sharing of false information to U.S. intelligence sources to get FISA warrants. He is personally responsible for the sharing of false information with American intelligence agencies, and he, I challenge him to a debate at the national press club for one hour, two hours, three hours about his role in the entire pre-election. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: How about on this show for now, one hour one on one? DIGENOVA: And about Leon Panetta. Leon Panetta he should be ashamed of himself after what he did in Benghazi when he kissed Hillary Clinton's fanny, refused to allow forces to come to the rescue of people and now he says, he says that he thinks the Russians may have something on the president to compromise him? Shame on Leon Panetta, may he rot in hell. HANNITY: Wow. Monica? MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: From what I'm hearing, Sean, we are still in the early days of the investigation into the internal domestic internal targeting of Donald Trump and his associates and the campaign. These are the early days, Sean. And what we may find out is that the root of all evil may have gone through James Comey, may have gone through James Clapper, may have gone through John Brennan, may have gone all the way up to Barack Obama, or all of the above. We don't know yet. But what we do know is that they were trying to inoculate these agencies like the FBI, the NSA, the CIA by comments like Chuck Schumer's saying, they're sacrosanct. You cannot -- you can't go after them. Well, we are not supposed to be able to go after them because they are supposed to be above politics and this kind of corruption-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: All right. Let me go back to Joe. CROWLEY: -- and we now know they weren't. HANNITY: Joe, this conspiracy -- you are right. How dare they-- (CROSSTALK) DIGENOVA: You bet. HANNITY: -- we just laid out all the evidence, how much tougher Trump has been on Russia than Obama. DIGENOVA: Right. Not even close. And you know what? Well, you know what? There's another guy, Michael Hayden. The guy who never put his big boy pants on ever when he was DCI. You talk about a guy who kowtowed to Congress, couldn't handle the pressure, he looked for any political port in a storm. But when it comes to the worst, it's Brennan. When you go back and you look at everything that happened in 2016 and 2017, especially during the transition between the election and the inauguration, at the center of this conspiracy is John Brennan. John Brennan is a thug. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: But wait, let me ask you this. DIGENOVA: He is a liar, and he is a traitor. HANNITY: If they -- if they advance a phony conspiracy theory about-- DIGENOVA: You bet. HANNITY: -- about the president of the United States that has been tougher on Putin than Obama ever was. DIGENOVA: You bet. HANNITY: The damage, no, this is important that he has something on Trump, you are really onto something that's very profound. The damage that they are doing to this country by doing so, and they irresponsibly throw out reckless conspiracies-- DIGENOVA: Exactly. (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: And you know what, Sean? DIGENOVA: Exactly, Sean. CROWLEY: I mean, I think those are their preemptive strikes. But I think there is something else going on. When you look at the documents delays, and all of the legal stonewalling, DOJ intelligence agencies, number one, they are trying to hide incriminating evidence. Right? Number two, they think they may very well win in November. Democrats might control the House, and therefore, they can permanently eliminate any evidence of their wrongdoing. And three, it may very well be that they are trying to run out the statute of limitations on the Clintons, on FBI wrongdoings, may be of wrongdoing on behalf of the intelligence agencies. DIGENOVA: You bet. CROWLEY: They are trying to run out the clock so we won't be able to go after them and prosecute them. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Absolutely. Devin Nunes-- (CROSSTALK) DIGENOVA: And you know who is going to help them do it? Rod Rosenstein. He is an evil man accompanied by an attorney general who is totally incompetent and asleep at the wheel. HANNITY: Wow. Powerful. Let's think about this. CIA agents, Schumer saying don't mess with them. They get you six days on Sunday. DIGENOVA: You bet. HANNITY: This is not the United States trying to influence the presidential election, favoring somebody who committed felonies, keeping her in the game, then turning their sites on the other candidate, then using a phony Russian dossier, none of this is right. And if we don't fix it, we are beyond Venezuela, this is now propaganda that would rival Pravda-- (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: Most dangerous scandal in U.S. history, Sean. HANNITY: -- and the former Soviet Union. All right, guys. CROWLEY: Most dangerous. HANNITY: We'll have you both back. Important, important discussions we're having. When we come back, the House intel committee chairman, Devin Nunes says, yes, they are trying to run out the clock and hope the Democrats get elected. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. The House intel committee chairman, Devin Nunes, he blasted the Justice Department yesterday during an interview, claiming that some within the DOJ, they're hoping the Republicans will actually lose the House on the midterm elections. He also said that if there was evidence of the Russians were colluding with the Trump campaign in 2016, Congress would've been briefed on it at the time, which they were not. Now remember, it was Chairman Nunes back in 2014 he sounded the alarm about Russia's malicious intent to cause chaos around the world and yes, in our very own elections. Here now is the House intel committee chair, Devin Nunes. So with all this talk about meddling and interference it happened at least in '08, it happened in 2012, you warned the Obama administration very publicly in 2014, and now we're supposed to act surprised that it all happened, although, you know, it was under Barack Obama's watch, not Donald Trump. REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF.: Yes, Sean. Look, I think I warned them not just in 2014, but very specifically in 2016 where I called it the largest intelligence errors since 9/11, our failure to understand Putin's plans and intentions. And remember, by that time, we have seen the Russians actively involved in many elections around the globe. They were actively trying to interfere in elections in Eastern Europe, and some of the former Soviet states. So this was nothing new at all, and what I am most upset about in this whole situation of many things, but when you go back to that time period is how they were able to ignore the warnings that we were sending from the House intelligence committee. And then lo and behold, after they lost the election, they first tried to blame fake news and when that didn't work, they switched into this whole concept of Russia. HANNITY: So this is a big point, too, is that if there was any collusion, certainly you would've known about it at the time. And if anything had come up between now and then, you would have seen that as you have seen almost everything. So the question is, why is the witch hunt going on? And how do you look at the Mueller indictments then of these 12 Russians that are the equivalent of our CIA operatives, they are never coming to America, there's never going to be a trial, Mueller, you know, indicted these bot companies thinking they would never respond, now he is asking the judge in that case if they could literally not turn over any documents, in other words, that there won't be any disclosure that doesn't accurate. (CROSSTALK) NUNES: And remember, and remember, so it's not just about the warnings that I gave into 2014, '15, and '16. It is also a fact that a year and a half ago, the House intelligence committee had more than what's in the Mueller indictment of the 12 Russian officers. OK? So we had more information than that. Now we put it in our report in March, it was in our report that was made public in April, it's heavily redacted, remember, by the Department of Justice and FBI. But we had all this information. And so, you know, the thing that I brought up, is I just find the timing of this to be very hard to believe. Right? HANNITY: yes. NUNES: You might give them the benefit of the doubt, but why does this always happen? Every time something happens on one side where we find out a new revelation about what appears to be real problems in the FBI and DOJ with this investigation, then all of a sudden, they drop an indictment. It happens time and time again. And this one is really bad. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: So this is what I want to ask you, do you think they are trying to literally, as you said, you believe the FBI and DOJ they're are obstructing in terms of doing what is their -- what your authority constitutionally is oversight, and they have been obstructing the entire way. And now there is talk about actually impeaching Rod Rosenstein, and there is talk about holding these people in contempt. And you say they're really doing this hoping that Dems take over Congress and that it all ends then? NUNES: It's the oldest trick in the book. So, many of the bureaucracies here in Washington know how to way out Congress. They know to try to plan meetings on a Friday when they know there are no votes, or on a Monday when there's not votes. They vote -- you know that's the times they want to get things. They wait, they know that Congress is going to l adjourn next week. And so, the more that they delay for no reason, we are waiting on many documents, as you know, we are getting very slow snail paste cooperation that is clearly designed to wait until next week when Congress adjourns. Now I have news for them. They are still going to have to come in and give the depositions, they may think they are not going to, but they are going to be coming in and to get depositions throughout the summer. And that is part of the 42 names that I sent to Chairman Gowdy and Chairman Goodlatte so I have every expectation that there will be many opportunities for these 42 individuals to come to Congress, even though they have tried to wait us out. I think they would love to see Republicans lose. And I say that, and I don't want -- I hate to say that, but I have to believe that the Department of Justice and FBI, the people at leadership, they are banking on a loss by the Republicans in the fall. Which is why people have to understand how important it is going to be to get out and vote in this election to ensure that members of Congress will return that are actively involved to ensure -- because of the Democrats get control, they are going to drop all of this investigation. They are not going to do anything on this investigation. HANNITY: Sure. They will cover up the whole -- the biggest, this is about literally trying to steal a presidential election. Those top it all. I hope you do hold them in contempt, and if it means impeachment, then that must be done. Otherwise, no congressional subpoena will ever have any teeth to it, ever. It will be the end of it. Mr. Chairman, thank you for being with us. When we come back, our video of the day you do not want to miss, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Following President Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin, conspiracy TV MSNBC, they sent a reporter to Wisconsin to interview Trump supporters about their thoughts on the meeting and the liberal outrage. I don't think this is what they expected though. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a lot of backlash going on now especially when he said well, I said I did and I didn't. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of people weren't happy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. But I'm totally in support of him. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And why? And why are you still supporting? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because he's an entrepreneur. He's a businessman, working-class person's presidents. He is trying to make this country great again. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you support the president? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you continue to support him despite this week? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not one bit worried about the rest of the world. They are not worried about us. So, you know, I'm not worried one bit about what the rest of the world thinks. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: You know what? They have one playbook. The left. Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic. They want dirty air, water killed granny, kill the kids. And Trump is horrible. He's more horrible than yesterday and the day before. They've overreached. All right. We'll always be fair and balanced. We're not the destroy-Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. It's time. Ingraham taking over. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" October 11, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Buckle up, because in 26 days, we have midterm elections, and the country's fate, not to put pressure on you, it's all in your hands. \u00a0And I have been telling you for months, the single most important midterm election in our lifetime. Democrats, the destroy Trump media, they have no shame. They're not backing down. Eric Holder is trying to walk back his \"kick 'em while they're down\" comments. We're going to explain that. We have a major moment today at the White House. Phenomenal. Kanye West meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office. And not surprisingly, the left is in a meltdown mode over it. You will not believe -- well, yes, I guess you should, because it's predictable -- one of the despicable comments that were made about Kanye. We've got the tape. Also, our first lady, Melania Trump, breaks her silence on being the target of bullying. And we've got the evidence to back her up. And Democrats sinking to a new law and they're trying to win, their attempts to win in November. Exclusively, Project Veritas, tonight, has exposed an explosive undercover video, we will show it to you. We got a lot to get to. All right. It's time for tonight's breaking news -- we're glad you're with us -- opening monologue. (MUSIC) HANNITY: All right. So, earlier today, President Trump met with rapper Kanye West in the Oval Office today. They spoke about really important topics -- prison reform, job creation, safe communities in America. Kanye did not hold back his praise for the president. Here's what he said. \u00a0Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KANYE WEST, MUSICIAN: I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. You know, they try to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends. But this hat gives me, it gives me power in a way. It was something about, when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. \u00a0You made a Superman, that's my favorite super hero, you made a Superman cape for me also as a guy who looks up to you, looks up to Americans, industry guys. Nonpolitical, no (EXPLEITVE DELETED), but the beep on it, however you do it, five-second delay, and just go ahead and get it done. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Great lesson in life -- you cannot live your life and be courageous if you care so much about what people think. Interesting comment about wearing the \"Make America Great Again\" hat. And, yes, we need prison reform. People like that woman, Mrs. Johnson, who was on this program, for one offense, her whole life. And the president gave her a pardon. We need jobs, yes. We're making more jobs in America. We need more -- as many as possible. \u00a0We need every neighborhood in the country safe for every American. And when Kanye was being open and honest and looking for solutions and giving his opinions, when was the left doing? Attacking him. What's wrong with what he's saying? What about jobs, what about safe neighborhoods? And, of course, we see the predictable, vile, bludgeoning that we see, now sadly almost on a daily basis. The media has been relentless, even before Kanye even met with the president. Some members of the abusively biased media brought up his struggles with mental illness. Really? This is sick. And used disgusting language to describe him. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Black folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft. Now, all of a sudden, Kanye, because he puts on a MAGA hat and he's an attention whore like the president, he's all of a sudden, now, the model spokesperson? He's the token Negro of the Trump administration? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was an embarrassment. Kanye's mother is rolling over in her grave. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think you had there a man who's clearly not okay, and a president who's willing to exploit that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, it's a combination of stream of consciousness, I felt like I was sitting in on a psychiatric visit, and a commercial for Donald Trump. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On the question of mental health, on the question of exploiting him, I felt very exploitive to me, there was something very fragile about -- and sad about Kanye pull out his phone and franticly typing in his code, it was four zeros, pulling up a weird picture of a car. \u00a0I mean, just expand on that, seems like an important point, I haven't heard anyone else on television make it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: These people are just -- they totally disgust me. It's absolutely despicable. What Kanye West, and millions of other Americans are now realizing, you know what, the Democrats had eight years, they gave us a failed agenda, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s. More debt than all presidents before him combined with Obama. Really? The first president never to hit 3 percent GDP growth. Look at what's happening. The Trump agenda is creating a future for the forgotten men and women in this country that Democrats claim that they love so much. That's a future for every American. That's a future for our kids. Ask yourself this, why is the left so threatened by a meeting talking about prison reform, and about jobs, and a better economy, and about violence in some neighborhoods and some parts of the country? Is it because the Democratic Party is exposed for having failed all these years? All of the hysteria surrounding Kanye's pro-Trump comments, is an admission that President Trump is making progress, executing on an agenda, lower taxes, less burdensome regulation, lower unemployment, economic prosperity? \u00a0Fourteen states record low unemployment, Hispanic unemployment record low. \u00a0Record low unemployment for African-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace? And, of course, we have more kids, more youth jobs available than we have had in 50 years. Well, Kanye is experiencing is what African-American conservatives sadly have experienced for years -- mock, demonized, ridiculed, punished by the leftist machine for daring to think on their own and questioned big government policies that have crippled people in this country and have failed miserably. Now, the modern Democratic Party is devoid of any ideas or solutions, this tired scheme of redistribution, a proven total failure. And anyone who dares to try and work with President Trump to craft real solutions that really will help people and create safer neighborhoods, is vilified. We see it today. Just look at the number of Democratic leaders encouraging mob violence against their political opponents. Just yesterday, what do we show you, video of Obama's attorney general, the top cop in the country, for whatever, eight years, less than that. Six years. Eric Holder, they go low, ditch civility, kick Republicans when they're on the ground, kick 'em. \u00a0Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: Michelle Obama, I love her. She and my wife are really tight, which really scared me and Barack. But Michelle always says when they go low we go high. No, no. When they go low, we kick 'em. (APPLAUSE) That's what -- that's what this new Democratic Party is about. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: That's the real Eric Holder. But after the backlash, now he's trying to walk back his comments, which is phony and contrived, sends out a tweet, OK, stop the fake outrage, I am obviously not advocating violence. \u00a0When in fact I was A.G., crime was at a historic low. I'm saying Republicans are undermining our democracy. Democrats need to be tough, proud and stand for the values we believe in. No, we didn't put words in Eric Holder's mouth. He said kick 'em. He made those comments. So, Eric Holder can sit and spin anyway he wants, you saw the smile on his face, a crowd that supported him. We're not stupid. We know you meant it. He meant exactly what he said. \u00a0And he should have just said, yes, that's how I feel, sorry. Words like that have consequences. Now, earlier today during an interview on \"Fox & Friends\", the president had this to say about Eric Holder's pathetic comments. Take a look. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They have to be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous what Holder says. I mean, Holder was held in contempt by Congress. Holder went after Christians. He went after our great evangelicals. He went after the Tea Party people, you know that. They just settled, the IRS just settled that case. Holder is -- he's got some problems, and I don't see him running. If he did run, I think he'd get gobbled up before he gets to the election itself. \u00a0I think the primaries would gobble him up. (END AUDIO CLIP) HANNITY: Eric Holder is not alone. Other Democratic leaders -- they've been cheering on these types tactics. This is all -- well, on tape. Take a look yourself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about. That's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that's when civility can start again. REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, and you turn back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere. SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: Please, don't just come here today and then go home. Go to the Hill today. Get up and please, get up in the face of some Congress people. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: With comments like that, is it any wonder we see on a regular basis, we see Republican lawmakers, public figures, women run out of restaurants, heckled at airports, heckled in front of their wives. Look what happened to a truck in Washington State that had a pro-Trump bumper sticker on it. The owner of the car, Johnny McKay, he says he decided to take an Uber home from a local bar. And when he came back, this is what he saw, the language of the left, the people that want to be in power in 26 days, reaching new lows on an hourly basis. These sequences could be scary. First lady Melania Trump during an interview with ABC News had this to say about how she has been treated and she's right. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY: I would say I'm the most bullied person on the world. INTERVIEWER: You think you are the most bullied person in the world? MELANIA TRUMP: One of them, if you really see what people saying about me. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: The first lady is right. She's been the focus of constant media bullying, harassment, since the day she and her husband descended from the escalators down at Trump Tower. They have been unrelenting. There are a few examples to prove her point. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT TRUMP: I want to really thank the first lady, Melania, who has done an incredible job. She works so hard on this event. And so I want to thank you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, yes. Not a chance she did one thing to set that up. She didn't dye eggs. The only thing she's been working on is an escape tunnel. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was struck by Melania's statement. (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do not go -- don't do it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can't do that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Now we know. That's why we're telling you don't do it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No White House Easter celebration would be complete without story time from our first lady. MELANIA TRUMP: Be clever and curious, just like a cat, ask lots of questions about this and that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: About this and that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today is Melania's birthday. Happy birthday, Melania. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That wasn't necessary. That's so mean. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president was there to meet the freed men, along with Melania, who is hoping to be freed next. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Yes, Jimmy Kimmel, the pervert walking around with cucumbers in his pants showing people. Really, we need Mr. Pervert judging other people? And it didn't stop there. After Melania Trump had a kidney procedure -- well, then the media couldn't understand why she was staying out of the spotlight. Maybe she was healing? Some speculated she must have had plastic surgery. One Rolling Stone writer questioning if she was concealing abuse. \u00a0They're also ridiculing her clothing choices. I want to say this is going to stop, but we know it won't. We're going to have more example of the left's new lows in minutes. But, first, also tonight, we have a disturbing new undercover video, very revealing, Project Veritas, in the tape, what do they do, they caught people working for Tennessee Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, calling the voters of Tennessee, quote, ignorant. The people on the tape also saying that he lied when he said that he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh if he were in the Senate. Oh, shocking. We haven't independently confirmed the undercover video, but I think words speak for itself. We'll let you decide. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He wasn't really, right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Vote for Kavanaugh? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think so. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was so confused, because I just can't believe that he would actually vote yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He wouldn't, but he said he would. I don't know if that makes it worse or better. No, it makes it better, but still -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But what's -- like I don't understand what's the game by saying yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Moderate Republicans. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is it because it's like the voters? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. That's it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, he'll lose voters if -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, straight up. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are the people of Tennessee ignorant? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: They're ignorant, the people of Tennessee. He's not going to vote yes. That's all -- we're just doing that for show. We're lying to everyone that we want to vote for us. And asked for a comment, Tennessee Victory 2018, the coordinated campaign of the Tennessee Democratic Party, they said, oh, Project Veritas posed as a fake volunteer, and, quote, used secret video recording equipment to capture uninformed speculative comments made last weekend by college students. Those are the people that work on the campaign and youth organizers. Another stunning video, also released tonight that, could have a huge impact on the election. A video from 2011, what does it show? Arizona Democratic Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema calling Arizonians, the people she wants to vote for her, crazy. Wow, there is a great campaign ad. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KYRSTEN SINEMAN, ARIZONA DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATE: I want to talk to you about the things that I think you can do to stop your state from becoming Arizona. It reminds me, I was born and raised in Arizona, in Tucson, near the border. When we grew up, I remember in first grade, we learned a song about Arizona, because Arizona is a state of the five Cs. \u00a0So, cattle, copper, citrus, cotton, and climate. And these were the five things that our state historically made money out of. If I may add a sixth C, it's called crazy. (LAUGHTER) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: The only crazy part would be if the people of Arizona fell for that act and that lie. We reached out for comment, we haven't heard back. Her campaign spokesman gave a statement to the \"Associated Press\", she was frustrated -- no one in the state legislature was standing up to out of state special interests, we're going to take away healthcare from children and tuition and more expense, and that's a crock of you know what also. And then there's more disturbing news about Sinema. Just yesterday, foxnews.com reported that she, quote, promised events at Arizona State University, get this, featuring a lawyer convicted for aiding an Islamist terror organization. And its leader, the lawyer in question, represented someone who was sentenced to life in prison in the 1990s for plotting to blow up the U.N. and FBI building and more, in Arizona. Republican Martha McSally, the Republican, anything a tight race. She happens to be an American hero that has served her country. I hope the people of Arizona are paying attention tonight. And the people of Tennessee are paying attention. By the way, the people in Nevada, I hope you are paying attention. Dean Heller has just a slight lead in some of the polls. That is an important seat. Marsha Blackburn, friend of show, squaring off against the phony that we exposed tonight, she is in a tight race in Tennessee. And, of course, Blackburn with a slight edge. Now, let's take a look at the House of Representatives. Now, we've been telling you 10 congressional districts tonight, these are the districts that will decide the balance of power in Washington, D.C. Do you want Nancy Pelosi as your speaker? Pay attention. Now, we're going to show 10 more House districts that voters need to keep an eye on. This will define the election results in 26 days. Arkansas, second district, where Republican incumbent French Hill in a serious battle with Democratic challenger Clarke Tucker. Next in Iowa, their first district, Republican incumbent, Rob Blum's seat, this a Freedom Caucus member, at risk of being overtaken by Democrats, is one of the Democrats' best opportunities to snag a seat. If you're in that district, you need to vote. Now, let's stay in Iowa where the third district is absolutely in play. \u00a0GOP incumbent David Young has a tough fight, Trump won there by four points in 2016. Kansas, a few races to watch in Kansas, district two, Republican Steve Watkins, is taking on a Democrat, Paul Davis. Kentucky's third district, Republican incumbent Kevin Yoder. He's been challenged by Democrat Sharice Davids in a district that Hillary took by one point. That's going to be a tight race. Now you go to the Kentucky sixth district, where another incumbent, Republican Andy Barr in a tight race, against Amy McGrath. Let's go back to Nevada for a few critical races out there. Their third district, Republican Danny Tarkanian, yes, that Tarkanian, the son of, faces an uphill battle against Democrat Susie Lee. And then there's Nevada fourth, where the Republican candidate Hardy is taking on the Democrat Horsford. Wisconsin's first district, another open seat contest, Republican Brian Steele is facing Democrat Randy Bryce. This is a race to replace Speaker Paul Ryan. We need that seat to stay Republican. By the way, might want to stay and vote for Scott Walker who has done an amazing job for the people of Wisconsin, he's in the fight of his life in 26 days. In West Virginia 3, GOP candidate Carol Miller up against Democrat Richard Ojeda. And we're just 26 days out. Once again, you have the chance to shock the world like you did two years ago. You've got to go vote. Joining with us reaction, former Clinton pollster, adviser, Mark Penn. The author of the New York Times best seller \"Jesus is Risen\", David Limbaugh, and David has done some legal work for me in the past. By the way, and you have also, I've never been a great Christian that you are, your books have made me a better person. Let me put it that way, and very informative. DAVID LIMBAUGH, AUTHOR, \"JESUS IS RISEN\": Thank you. HANNITY: We know their agenda is, David. We see that people are openly lying. I don't see an agenda from the Democrats at all. What are they going to do to make the country better, to help the people of the country? LIMBAUGH: They utterly have no agenda. So, they pit Americans against other Americans, black against white, women against men, rich against poor. \u00a0That's why they're so outraged about Kanye, because he is finally coming out and straying from the Democrat plantation. And only Democrats -- only blacks who support the liberal cause can read. \u00a0We are to assume, think about what these people on MSNBC were saying, that Kanye can't read because he supports conservatives. So, that means, blacks who support policies that will help them, don't read. It's just amazing. They have no substantive policies that will work. HANNITY: Mark, I know you worked for the Clintons but you're also a pollster. The bottom line for me as an American, I want every American to have the American dream. Nice house, safe neighborhood, decent car, take their kids to Disney, go out to eat once every week or every other week, not have to worry, save a little for their retirement. We can -- that is achievable. But under Barack Obama, we went way backwards. Donald Trump's policies are working. Do you think this is an opportunity for Republicans to now bring in to the fold demographic groups that maybe have not voted Republican in the past? MARK PENN, FORMER CLINTON POLLSTER AND ADVISER: Well, look, as pollster, Donald Trump sits at about 45 percent approval. That's below the 50 percent that a president really needs despite the good economy. So there have been a lot of issues, a lot of terms, a lot of positions -- HANNITY: But he's only a bit higher than Barack Obama at the same time of his presidency. PENN: That is true, that actually he stabilized his polling. But he hasn't -- he hasn't gotten above 50. And, look, Democrats believe in the American dream too. HANNITY: What are they offering this election? What are they running on except hate Trump, open borders, keep Obamacare and take the crumbs back? PENN: There's a lot of Democrats running on healthcare. There's a belief that the Republicans didn't fix health cares. HANNITY: ObamaCare health care. PENN: And that it's sitting out there. And Obamacare has had a resurgence from what it was. So, look, while there are a couple of people saying some really bad things, and look I don't like what Hillary said or what Holder said because I think that Michelle Obama is right, Democrats have to stay high. When they don't stay high, they basically give ammunition for you -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: -- said get into people's faces. He once said, I'm going to send Mr. Burgess to Fox News and take on Sean Hannity and tear him up. He did say that, too. PENN: Well, in fact, when he was president, he was, in fact, moved over to the center, reached out to the other side, find the place -- (CROSSTALK) PENN: I think Democrats would do a lot better if they did that today. HANNITY: But we have 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million in poverty. He never reached 3 percent GDP growth. Record low unemployment for every demographic, David Limbaugh. LIMBAUGH: Yes, Obama did not reach out. He said get in the back seat of the car. We don't want you to do a lot of talking. He was the most divisive. HANNITY: You have to sit in the back, he said, yes. LIMBAUGH: So, yes, well, the Democrats do not, with all due respect to Mark, I do respect a lot, I don't think the Democratic Party does stand for the American Dream. They stand for the fundamental transformation of the American dream, the American founding principles, for actually for socialism, which historically has impoverished and enslaved people and led to totalitarianism, which is why the left is totalitarian in its tendencies, more and more. HANNITY: It doesn't just work. Obama, Obamacare, millions lost their plans, their doctors, paying double, in some cases triple by the time it was over. But I still, Mark, I know you're sincere, I do believe that. When we come back, more reaction on the left, defending this incivility. \u00a0More on Eric Holder trying to backtrack, on just kick 'em. Pam Bondi, she was run out of a restaurant. Sebastian Gorka, Dan Bongino, all coming up. Busy news night. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Here with reaction to all the breaking news tonight, the author of \"Why We Fight\", just out this week, defeating America's enemies with no apologies, Fox News national security strategist Sebastian Gorka. Also out this week, they're competing for the \"New York Times\" top spot with Tucker Carlson, the author of \"Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump\", former Secret Service agent, NRA TV contributor, Dan Bongino. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who herself was a victim of the mob. And, by the way, fake news CNN says you can't say it's a mob. You, Secretary Nielsen, Sarah Sanders, Ted Cruz, this is a mob that is being incited by people like Maxine waters. Follow them into department stores and restaurants. If any conservative did to a Democratic woman who was done to you, Pam, there would be fire and fury to use a phrase. PAM BONDI, R-FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: There certainly would, Sean. And it's the classic definition of a mob. If you look up what a mob is in the dictionary, it's inciting violence. And that's what they're doing. I was booed again the other night, someone saw me, and yelled my name like they had won the lottery, basically the lottery of getting to be mean to a human being. And you know that's what the world is turning into. HANNITY: But they're doing it to wives, and they're doing it to women, the very people that say that they have a monopoly, compassion, and that conservatives don't. BONDI: Exactly. HANNITY: Yes, I'm sorry you had to go through that. BONDI: Oh, I'm not going to be a victim. HANNITY: This is now what they're saying to do. We're seeing it daily. \u00a0And it is a mob. And Democrats are inciting this with their words in many ways. DAN BONGINO, \"SPYGATE\" AUTHOR: You know, they are, Sean, but I think this is happening for a reason. I think in this Trump era where now Trump just refuses to back down, to this political pressure, through the media, the liberal swamp, and these activist groups, it's enraged them. Sean, the left, for as much as I disagree with them ideologically, they're usually tactically smarter than this. Trump has them moving in scattered, they just don't know what to do any more because they're not used to a real political fight. Republicans -- elected Republicans would have backed down by now and Trump refuses to do it. HANNITY: We're looking at Ted Cruz and he's with his wife Heidi, and literally, he has to escort his wife and act as protection, Dr. Gorka, to get her out of the restaurant because they can't even let people sit for five seconds and at peace. SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Think about the metric in America today, that you risk bodily harm if you put on a red MAGA hat in many parts of the United States. That's actually an act of courage. The left walks around in t-shirts, with Che Guevarra, a mass murderer on their chest. We don't do anything to them. This is why the midterms are crucial, Sean. Do you want the mob to run America? Do you want people who will intimidate you if you do not toe their line? That's what the next 26 days are about. HANNITY: And Pam, when Kanye said today that it's freeing, really it's a sign of courage, I'm not going to let anybody tell me how to think and I'm going to wear my make America great again hat, he could have pulled back a little bit on the cursing in the Oval Office, but we'll put that aside for a second. Most people have cursed in their lives. But you know, it's sad that we have the best, the lowest unemployment, for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian-Americans. And somebody say good job. Let's do more of this. BONDI: And Kanye is a businessman, Sean. And he's a capitalist and he understands that. He's saying let's make more products in the United States. He gets it. He knows all of the good that the president has done for the country. And Kanye West is brave. He's his own man, he's not scared to speak his mind and wear his make America great again hat. None of us are going to be victims, frankly. Ted Cruz was out there protecting his wife. And you know, everyone is going to continue to do what's right. Despite what the former chief legal officer of our entire country said to kick peep when they're down. It's despicable. I know Eric Holder, he should really be ashamed. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: I don't know, I'm sure I don't agree on everything, I disagree will almost stop and frisk because it worked in New York and lives were saved. But Dan Bongino, I agree on prison reform, I agree on safer cities, and I agree on make products in America and create more jobs for Americans. I'm all in. BONGINO: Sean, I have been vocal about this. I wish a lot of the establishment type Republicans who are selling this moment short would take a time-out and think about this. Where have we fell short over the years. Cultural capital. Democrats have built up a bank account of cultural capital through Hollywood and celebrities, and finally we have people with cultural capital saying hey, these Republicans aren't crazy, let's see what they have to say. It's a big deal. HANNITY: Dr. Gorka, by the way, you cleaned up really well. (CROSSTALK) GORKA: I have shaved from (Inaudible) on your show, Sean. HANNITY: We'll give you the last word. GORKA: Look, it's very, very simple. They have no policies, they have no argument, all they have is intimidation. And we will not let them get away with it. HANNITY: All right, thank you all. Thanks for taking a break from that event. Pam, we're sorry what you went through. When we come back, we're going to have more on Kanye's meeting with the president today. Kristin Fisher has a full report. Candace Owens is with us as she is with Kanye in our nation's capital. And a phenomenal candidate running for Senate, in Michigan, you're going to love this guy, John James, also coming up, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Joining us with the latest on the meeting between President Trump and Kanye West, Fox News correspondent in Washington tonight, Kristin Fisher. Kristin? KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: You know, Sean, it isn't easy to upstage President Trump. But Kanye West stole the show today in the Oval Office. The meeting was supposed to be about prison reform and it kind of was. But Kanye turned it into a 10-minute-long stream of consciousness about jobs, race, guns, and why he loves his MAGA hat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KANYE WEST, RAPPER: They try to scare me, to not wear this hat. My own friends. But this hat, it gives me, it gives me power in a way. It was something about, when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: Superman. He also took on his critics back home in Hollywood. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WEST: What I need Saturday Night Live to improve on, and what I need the liberals to improve on, if he don't look good, we don't look good. This is our president, he has to be the freshest to fly his, to fly his planes, the best factories, and we have to make our core be empowered. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: So you can see the entire White House press pool was crammed into the Oval Office to capture this spectacle. And at one point Kanye was asked the question about gun violence. And the Second Amendment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WEST: The problem is illegal guns. Illegal guns is the problem. Not legal guns. We have the right to bear arms. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: And he also has the right to show the world the pass code to his iPhone, which he did inadvertently. It was 000000. Sean, please tell me that you have a better pass code than Kanye. HANNITY: Well, I have a better pass code, it changes every other day, I don't even have the same phone one week to the next. FISHER: Well, that's good. Very secure. HANNITY: For those that don't know, Kristin Fisher's parents were both astronauts. And I got to meet her dad. That is the coolest thing in the world. (CROSSTALK) FISHER: Are you going to bring this up every night? HANNITY: Well that-- FISHER: It is -- it is one of the coolest things. And that big Russian Soyuz emergency landing today was just, I have to say, incredible to watch. What those astronauts and cosmonauts and the entire NASA team was able to do. HANNITY: So anybody that gets in a rocket and wants to go up in space has a lot of courage. And I just admire all of them. So I had a chance to meet your dad. FISHER: I will relay the message, I'm sure they're watching. HANNITY: My best to both of them. All right. Joining us now with reaction, the GOP U.S. Senate candidate from Michigan, John James is with us. And Turning Point USA communications director, our friend, Candace Owens. Candace was with Kanye in D.C. earlier today. You actually facilitated a phone call with me and Kanye. And it wasn't -- we actually face timed. What I really liked about it, is all he wants is answers. All he wants is solutions. All he wants is opportunities and that's what impresses me. I agree with prison reform, I agree with more jobs, I want more made in America, I want a better economy and I want safe neighborhoods. What is there to disagree with here? CANDACE OWENS, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TURNING POINT USA: The fact that he likes our president. The fact that he's bringing foreign optimistic message. Let's be clear. The left has become the party of hate and division. Kanye is talking about love and unity and support for our president who is doing a tremendous job. He's talking about the real numbers that are in, OK. A 400 percent increase in black growth in jobs and starting black businesses. A 400 percent increase. Black unemployment at an all-time low. President Obama brought an all-time high for welfare for black community. We had President Clinton before him, a Democrat president brought an all- time high for black incarceration. Why is the problem here? Why isn't the black community standing with our president right now? HANNITY: Did he say he was a billionaire? OWENS: Yes, actually Fox News reported that how (Inaudible) became a billionaire. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: You know, how awesome, and he's talking about jobs that are paying 50, 60, 70,000 a year. You know what, there are people that would love those jobs. Let's get them here. John James, I had the opportunity to interview you on my radio show. I honestly, I can say this, on radio 30 years, he just took my breath away. Because of your passion. I hope the people of Michigan are getting to know you. I know it's a tough state to run for Senate. I hope the people of Michigan are hearing what I think is a great message to make Michigan great again. JOHN JAMES, R-SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, MICHIGAN: Look, people in the State of Michigan are very astute. This is a state that not only Donald Trump win but so did Bernie Sanders. People in the State of Michigan are sick and tired of being sick and tired. And when you look at the fact that 98 percent of black people vote in one party that's the reason we don't have a seat at both tables. I'm an independent thinker who prioritizes God and country in that order. And I will always serve the people of the State of Michigan as well as I serve the United States of America when I deployed to operation Iraqi Freedom. HANNITY: John, I went through Detroit the last time I was there and I saw one of America's great cities. And it was devastating. It was, I mean, they're selling homes for a dollar, knocking down entire neighborhoods to consolidate because of all the jobs, the manufacturing jobs that moved out. Now jobs are moving in to areas like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio and Pennsylvania. I think we can revitalize a city like Detroit. Am I dreaming here or rooted in reality? JAMES: No, look, you're exactly on track. We know that we can revitalize Detroit. But the thing is, until these economic opportunity improvements come to the people in the neighborhoods, our forgotten neighborhoods and our forgotten farms, the areas that have been neglected and failed by Democrat policies, decades in the past, we have marched from Selma to Detroit. We have rioted from Baltimore to Watts. And nothing has changed in 50 years. We need to make sure that we don't just-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: But first, the neighborhoods should be safe. Chicago isn't safe. I want -- I'd love for the president to partner with Kanye and come up with answers for the people of Chicago. It is a shooting zone. And it's been happening for years. And nobody is fixing it. JAMES: We need more solution, we need more leadership and less partisanship. HANNITY: Yes. JAMES: You can learn a little bit more about my candidacy on Johnjamesforsenate.com, but I have the experience leading on the battleground and the board room and bringing my leadership experience to solve and make our neighborhoods better, bringing everybody up and making our community safer. HANNITY: Candace, why are people, that are African-Americans and conservative brutalized by the left? OWENS: Because they don't want us to be free. Listen, make no mistake the left depends on the black vote. They have to earn more than 85 percent of the black vote to sustain their party. This is why they sew division, this is why they need the themes of racism to stay alive. But guess what, Sean, the black community is waking up. And that's why Kanye West terrifies them because he's not scared in the same way that I'm not scared. And we are seeing more black conservatives waking up and speaking out against Democrat Party. HANNITY: I have a Hannity crystal ball. And what I see in my future are amazing futures for both of you, with strong leadership and just dynamic personalities. I wish you both Godspeed in your mission as you move forward. And I mean that. Thank you both. When we come back, Congressman Mark Meadows says Rod Rosenstein needs to go under oath, owes we, the people, answers. He'll join us with Sara Carter, John Solomon breaking news on the deep state, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: In an interview with Fox & Friends earlier today, President Trump said he gets along with Rod Rosenstein, gave credit to Mark Meadows and others for exposing what is happening with the Russia witch hunt. Take a look. (BEGIN VOICE CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I actually get along well with Rod. We have a witch hunt going on, which is disgraceful. And I have to tell you, I'll take these Republican guys with Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan and Gaetz and Gibbs and all of them, I hate to mention a few names because there's so many of them. I want to give every one of them credit. These are tough, smart guys. They know there was no collusion. It turned out with Russia. There was collusion but it was with Hillary Clinton, the DNC. These Republican folks, I think, they're becoming folk heroes. These are great, great people. And they want to get to the bottom of it. (END VOICE CLIP) HANNITY: I agree with that, the Freedom Caucus, they stand by their promises, they fight. Congressman Mark Meadows joins us right now. Fox News investigative reporter, Sara Carter, The Hill's, John Solomon. Congressman, we now have Rod Rosenstein, let's see, he recommended firing Comey, he signed the last FISA warrant, the third renewal application, and this is a guy that appointed Mueller. Now we have three people saying that he seriously was talking about wearing a wire to invoke the 25th Amendment. McCabe said it, well, actually four. McCabe said it, Lisa Page said it, let me think of the other ones, one other person said it. REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: Jim Baker? HANNITY: Jim Baker. That's it. MEADOWS: Yes. I tell you, the reporters that you have on, I'm with two great reporters that have done tremendous work on this front. But I think probably the biggest part is the president, is exactly right. There is no collusion. He knows it. I know it. Even the Democrats know it. And it's about time that Bob Mueller, he must finish the investigation. It's time to call it quits. What we're starting to find out are the wheels are coming off. Glen Simpson, Fusion GPS Glen Simpson refused to come before Congress, I talk to Chairman Gowdy this evening, the only option we have now is to hold him in contempt of Congress. HANNITY: Why isn't that happening? Where are the 302s that the president was going to release? Where are the FISA warrants that he was going to release? MEADOWS: Well, we've got to get those out. Transparency is good medicine, Sean, as you know I've been advocating for that, the president has been advocating. But he wants to be cautious. And I applaud that. You know, he's getting accused left and right of interfering in this investigation and yet, why I-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Interfering? MEADOWS: Yes. HANNITY: They're obstructing congressional investigation, that's your constitutional role which, to your credit you're doing. Sara Carter? SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER: I couldn't agree more with you, Sean, on this. I mean, look, we have Rod Rosenstein, obviously a lot of information has come out, in the last few weeks. We know that James Baker, the former general counsel of the FBI came forward and said, look, we took seriously what he said. He wanted to invoke the 25. We now know that there were two-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Wear a wire. CARTER: That's right. And secretly record the president of the United States. Beyond that we also know that there were two other people, apparently speaking with Rod Rosenstein. I give the president credit for this, Sean. The president is a great chess player. I think he's making his move now. I think that the president came out, he's been talking to Rod Rosenstein, we don't know what happened on that flight, we don't know exactly what they spoke about during those 30 minutes. But the president is looking and watching. And I absolutely believe there were other people inside this administration that were with Rod Rosenstein on this. HANNITY: Wow. CARTER: It's going on come out. I don't think it's going to come out next week. But I think eventually the president will make that public if he's smart. And then he'll get rid of Rod Rosenstein, he'll get rid of Jeff Sessions, he'll put other people in place. This is what I'm hearing behind the scenes. HANNITY: He needs to. CARTER: This is I believe will happen. HANNITY: All right. So Lisa Page, John Solomon, says for nine months they had no evidence of Russia collusion. JOHN SOLOMON, VICE PRESIDENT, THE HILL: That's right. HANNITY: Just before the appointment of Rod Rosenstein, to Mueller. And then of course, even Peter Strzok said there's no there there. Now I think with their media leak strategy that we have been able to unveil and report, along with the insurance policy comment, they leaked the information to different news sources, it all goes back to the Clinton phony Russian dossier, they leak it all over the place to create an atmosphere that, there's must so much happened, this really happened when just the opposite is true. The only Russian interference came from Hillary paying for Russian lies that were disseminated to the American people and used as a fraud on a FISA warrant court four times. SOLOMON: Yes. Listen, there is a lot of Harry Houdini going on in May of 2017 at the Justice Department. They knew they didn't have a case, and instead they tried to create the aura in the public media that there was a case and it was obstructed by the president. And I think when we look back in the history we're going to see a lot. I was thinking today because of the work of Congressman Meadows, Congressman Jordan, those who have been digging, we now know, I think two years ago of this month Glen Simpson and Christopher Steele were out peddling their story to the media trying to get it out before the election currently showing their political covers. Two years later, Glenn Simpson can't even come anymore and testify to Congress because he has to invoke his right against self- incrimination. How far has this investigation turned-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Wow, good point. SOLOMON: -- from collusion a Russia to collusion with the Democratic Party and the FBI. And it's because of people like Congressman Meadows and Congressman Jordan that back the trend-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: And you and Sara and Greg and others, you guys deserve credit. So what did I call this year? The year of the boomerang. Quickly question all of you. Will we get the declassified unredacted materials? Mark Meadows? MEADOWS: Yes, I think we will get them. Hopefully some sooner than later. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Before the election. MEADOWS: Before the election. Hopefully small group of them before the election. And we need to have them. HANNITY: Sara? CARTER: Yes, absolutely, we need the dossier, we also need the gang of eight packet which will expose the exculpatory evidence-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: And the 302s. CARTER: And the 302s. HANNITY: John, will we get them? Real quick. SOLOMON: Absolutely. No doubt about it. HANNITY: Before the election? SOLOMON: I think some of it is going to be, a lot of it will be after the election I fear. HANNITY: All right. Thank you all for what you're doing. Kid Rock at the White House today had a perfect response to a reporter, straight next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Kid Rock he was also at the White House today where he had a few words for reporters who has a pretty dumb questions for him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should Trump fire Jeff Sessions? KID ROCK, SINGER-SONGWRITER: He should fire you. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Just perfect. That's like the way the press deserves to be treated because they're fake news. All right. We will always be fair and balanced. We're not the destroy-Trump media. As of tomorrow night, 25 days till Election Day. Let not your heart be troubled. There she is, Laura Ingraham is next.

This is a rush transcript from \"Watters' World,\" July 28, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Welcome to \"Watters' World.\" I'm Jesse Watters. The truth about socialism, that's the subject of tonight's \"Watters' Words.\" There was a big blow up on \"The View\" this week, Meghan McCain and Joy Behar in a shout fest over socialism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\": Think about it for a second, Medicare, Social Security, garbage collection, the post office, the library. (CROSSTALK) MEGHAN MCCAIN, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\": I agree with you. I agree with you because we have -- which makes my head explode because by the way, I hope Democrats do run a Democratic socialist. BEHAR: You hope that we win? (CROSSTALK) MCCAIN: Because I think you're going to lose spectacularly and then I will look forward to election night when I finally get to celebrate and say, \"I told you so.\" He ended up running radical. (CROSSTALK) MCCAIN: On your platform, I think you should start paying the amount of taxes that every socialist in this country thinks you need to be -- because if you think the government is so good at spending money, look at the VA. BEHAR: No. (CROSSTALK) MCCAIN: That's dangerous. (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Passions are running high because the socialist rising star knocked off Pelosi's protege and is sucking up all the oxygen in the Democratic Party. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stumbled through weeks of gaffes since her primary win, and is being forced to defend her socialist brand. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, AMERICAN POLITICIAN: This socialist label is something that I think the media cares more about because I don't knock on a person's door and it's like, \"Hey, let me tell you about socialism.\" UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, that wouldn't. CORTEZ: That's not how I campaign. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. CORTEZ: If Fox News and if media wants to continue using this words, they're going to use the word, I think by me saying, \"Oh no, I'm not,\" this that and the other, it just becomes a distraction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Now, let's look at the facts about socialism, shall we? Venezuela -- a rich country blessed with bountiful natural resources is now a hell hole. Look what the experiment with socialism has wrought. Nearly 90 percent now live in poverty. Starvation -- the average person lost 24 pounds last year, and they are not trying to diet. Sick people are taking dog medicine. There is a massive toilet paper shortage and it's now the murder capital of the world behind El Salvador. If Democrat want to be bring socialism to America, it makes me wonder, do they want to destroy America? Now, they're going to say, \"Oh, no we mean Scandinavian countries, that's where socialism works.\" Democratic socialism, like Sweden. The Scandinavian socialism success story is a liberal fantasy. You know a country that's doing better than Sweden? Switzerland because it's a capitalist power house. Sweden isn't even really a truly socialist country anymore. Sweden was going off a cliff until about a decade ago when conservatives took over and implemented pro-capitalist reforms. Plus the Scandinavians nations are teeny and homogenous, they don't even compare to America. And by the way, did Scandinavia defeat the Nazis? Put a man on the moon? Create the iPhone? No, that was America. What are the major contributions to humankind from Scandinavia? Ikea. This Cortez individual says she wants free healthcare, free housing and free college. Free healthcare alone costs $30 trillion. You raise taxes on everyone in America and that won't even make a dent in paying that bill. And if socialists don't trust Trump, why give the Trump administration more power over your life? You want Trump in charge of your healthcare. You want Trump as your landlord. You want Trump running our colleges? I thought didn't like Trump University. The Federal government has a hard enough time taking care of our vets, securing the border and protecting us from hackers. The Obama administration couldn't even launch a website, and you want to give the government more responsibility? So when you hear people talk about socialism, just ask them, where has socialism ever worked? Here with reaction, the founder of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk and the host of CRTV's \"Michelle Malkin Investigates, \" Michelle Malkin. All right, Michelle, let's start with you. What do you think about this socialism experiment within the Democratic Party? MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\": Well, I think that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is everything that's wrong with overpriced liberal ivory towers plus extreme radical identity politics plus a slavering liberal media advocacy machine that is waiting for you the next savior. And Ocasio-Cortez really is like the logical fruit of the radical progressivism that we survived under Barack Obama. I mean, this is the man who said you didn't build that, who at some point you've earned enough money. And so of course now, we have this progeny, Ocasio-Cortez who is so economically and historically illiterate, Jesse, and thank you for giving that overview in your opening points there because you don't get that most liberal universities. I mean, she is so clueless. This is somebody who graduated with an economics degree from Boston University, she claims, who doesn't even know what the unemployment rate is. WATTERS: What a second, Michelle. Michelle. MALKIN: Let along -- right, let alone the history of the capitalist success around the world. WATTERS: Wait a second, I did not know that. Charlie, did you know that Ocasio-Cortez graduated with an economics degree? CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: She must have missed a couple of classes. Only in the university could you learn some of the nonsense that she is spewing. I find it funny, if socials professors really believed the nonsense that they profess, why don't they teach for free? Why do they sell the books back to the kids and why do they charge so much per credit hour? If they're such benevolent and wonderful communitarians and socialists, just do it for free. Get rid of the profit structure. Be a true example of that which in a Marxist society -- but of course, it's really interesting, those people that hate America, which I believe this is rooted in anti-Americanism. WATTERS: I do, too. KIRK: And what's so unique about America, we are the only country in the world, in the history of the world where even those who hate it refuse to leave. I always notice that the biggest proponents of socialism aren't those waiting in bread lines. WATTERS: You don't see a lot of people in Venezuela, Michelle, coming over to this country and advocating for socialist reforms, and just look at the news this week. You have 4.1 percent GDP growth. Record low unemployment. The EU trade deal starting to move forward. The remains of Korean War veterans are finally returning from North Korea. Things are going pretty well, and it seems like the socialist left wants to stop the progress. MALKIN: Yes, that's right. They can't stand it, and so I believe, so much of the radical left which is the mainstream of the Democrat Party doesn't only hate America. They hate the fact that we are founded on this principle of unleashing the great potential of hard working ambitious people. And under Obama, we had eight years of wealth shaming and success shaming, and it's only going to get worse under the Ocasio-Cortez regime which is again, taking over the mainstream of the Democratic Party. Here is what I want to say, which is very important because these people are peddling an ideology that is based on dependency and coercion. And these things are the most anti-progressive of values. They are regressive. There are not enough people in the media who want to tell the stories, and I have people all the time over the last 25 years who are like me -- who are children or grandchildren of immigrants who love this country because of the potentials that it promised them. It was not a guarantee. It was not an entitlement. It was simply the opportunity that which we enjoy. Look, I have been in this business for 25 years. I've started three web ventures. I am a proud unapologetic capitalist quote-unquote \"of color.\" And the only color that we care about really of course is green, not because we are greedy, but because we are trying to put find our table and other people's tables. I have been able to employ dozens of people, and every one of these businesses is based on voluntary associations of people mutually pursuing their self-interests. That is the beauty of American exceptionalism that people like Ocasio-Cortez have never ever experienced in their lives. These are people only who have signed the back of a paycheck, and not the front of a paycheck. WATTERS: That's right and I think Meghan McCain, Charlie made the point, if you want to pay your taxes, there's a little box there that you can say, \"Check,\" and you can voluntarily give more money to the government, but just picking up on something that Michelle just said, since Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 and 1981, worldwide poverty has gone from like 70 percent down to 10 percent, and incomes have risen almost over 100 percent worldwide. That's not because of the spread of socialism, that is the spread of free market capitalism. KIRK: Right, so free market capitalism has been the greatest wealth creating engine in the history of the world. Life expectancy in the year 1900 was a little over 40 years. Now, we are living late into our 80s. We have an abundance problem in the west. We throw away more food than we consume. We have an obesity epidemic, not a starvation epidemic. Now, mind you, it's very important, you can look at human migratory patterns as the best argument against Marxism. No one ever flees free market capitalism to go back to Marxism. They are leaving Havana for Miami, they're not leaving Miami for Havana. WATTERS: That's a great point. I mean, that's a great point. Michelle, when you hear people denigrate the American system like Cortez does, when we talked about importing socialism into America, do you really believe she thinks socialism can be successfully implemented in America and people can thrive? Or do you believe, and I am starting to have my doubts about this, do you believe they want to bring socialism here because they want to slow down America? MALKIN: Well, I think that they are -- as their ultimate goal, trying to bring down everything that made this country great in the first place. You can only do that if you are untethered from reality, and history and economic principles, how they actually work in real life, and that's why it's such a meme. I mean, it's an internet joke when you have these socialists and try to argue with them about the real world pragmatic impact. WATTERS: Let me just in there because you mentioned. MALKIN: Of socialism, and they say, \"Oh, it's not real yet. It's not real yet.\" WATTERS: Hold on, you mentioned a meme and I want to show you guys something that's gone viral over the internet. This woman, I think her name is Stuckey. She is a young conservative woman. She did a parody satire video where she interviewed Ocasio-Cortez and this thing is hilarious. It's gone viral. Let's take a look and then we can react. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALLIE STUCKEY, HOST, CRTV: Do you have any experience that qualifies you for this job? CORTEZ: I was growing up during the Clinton era, and then, basically when I was in middle school, 9/11 happened. STUCKEY: Do you have any knowledge whatsoever about how our political system works? CORTEZ: Hmm. STUCKEY: Why should voters vote for you? CORTEZ: You vote, it's democratic. STUCKEY: Well, this has been enlightening. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Charlie, that's obviously a fake interview, but the left is going nuts and they're calling it fake news and they are very sensitive. I mean, let's just at least be able to laugh at ourselves. KIRK: I love Allie. She did a great job there, and look, if you actually look at -- you look at Ocasio-Cortez's real interviews, it's not far off. She thinks the unemployment rate is dropping because people are taking two jobs. She thinks that Israel is illegally occupying Palestine. What was the other gem she said the other day? Oh, yes, socialism hasn't been tried despite it being tried over a hundred times in the last hundred years and over a hundred million people dead as a result of it, so. WATTERS: Well, that's why maybe people were confused on the left because they thought it was believable because it sounds like a regular interview. You missed on, there was another one that I want to play for you, Michelle, where she was out campaigning with Bernie Sanders and she said she wanted to do this. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CORTEZ: Hello, everybody. I'm so excited to be hopping on here, Senator Sanders' account and we're here in Kansas City to rally for Brent Welder. We're going to flip this seat red in November. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Flip the sit red, Michelle, and she can't even get the colors right. MALKIN: Go for it. Go for it, and I do want to give a shout out to Allie Stuckey. She is a colleague of mine at crtv.com and the insanity around the reaction to that shows you a couple of things, one is the double standards of course. They love those same techniques when to Stephen Colbert uses them every single week, and they can't stand the fact that conservatives, whether it's Charlie Kirk or me or you, Jesse, or Allie actually has fun bringing down these people and exposing them for how vacuous and moronic they really are. And so, what do you have here? The bottom line point here though is that just like with Barack Obama, they are propping up these empty vessels because it's all they have. It's moral bankruptcy. It is historic and economic bankruptcy and it's going to fail. Look, the Democratic Party slogan sounds like it's ripped off from Maduro or Chavez in Venezuela. For the people, right, we get it. We know. Crumbs for the people. That's what it's really about. WATTERS: Yes, which people? MS-13 people, Charlie? KIRK: Yes, the MS-13 beaus -- the people that they refuse to call animals. It seems that sympathy for ISIS and MS-13 are at all-time levels amongst the now Marxist left. I like to say the Republican Party, we are the party of Abraham Lincoln, they have become the party of Karl Marx. WATTERS: Oh, man. All right, well listen, Michelle, Charlie, we're just trying to educate people out there. I don't think a lot of people know about socialism. I don't even think Cortez knows about socialism. Maybe she is watching and she could take some notes. Guys, thank you, guys very much. KIRK: Thank you. WATTERS: Up next, Roseanne Barr and Nancy Pelosi. Wait until you hear what they had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE WOLF, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: I'm Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. It's popular nowadays to say ICE is bad, but there is no better representation of American values right now than ICE is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ICE is waging war for everything that's holy in this country. I guess, you could call it a holy war. ICE is guaranteeing my ticket to heaven. WOLF: Take it from me, no organization is better than ICE is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ICE is. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Comedian Michelle Wolf comparing ICE officers to ISIS terrorists. The left is amping up at attacks on the men and women who keep our borders safe and here's New York governor, Andrew Cuomo. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREW CUOMO, GOVERNOR, NEW YORK, DEMOCRAT: This administration is on a crusade against people who they do not consider original Americans. What they have done at the border is an example of it, what they have done in Puerto Rico, and they are on a jihad to deport as many people as they can who they believe are not in the United States legally. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Tom Homan, recently retired as acting ICE director under President Trump and he joins me now. So, Tom, what is your emotional reaction when you hear comedians and politicians denigrate the men and women who protect our country at the border? THOMAS HOMAN, RETIRED ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: That's the greatest insult to the men and women of the Border Patrol and ICE. Look, the comparison to terrorist organizations, does this comedian understand that ICE investigates terrorist organizations? We are the largest participant in the joint terrorism task force. We have presence in over 30 countries across the globe, what we call the visa security program. We have prevented nearly 8,000 people from getting a visa to come to this country that our intelligence show they will come to this country to do harm. So, for the men and women that serve this nation probably every day, that's an insult. She doesn't know the first thing about serving our nation. WATTERS: Yes, I mean, she is comparing the people that are protecting her from terrorists to terrorists. Completely insulting. I want to show you some video of the guest we had just before you, Charlie Kirk was down there riding around with an ICE agent at the border. And they were talking about some of these kids, the minors that they had briefly separated from their parents or so-called parents. And here is what he had to say. It's pretty interesting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These kids are like -- they are hard -core. They will take your lunch money when you're five. KIRK: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Immediately after we separated them, they established a hierarchy within the area that they were separated in. So there was one child -- a child. KIRK: Like eight years old? Nine years old? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was running the entire team there and telling other kids what they needed to do and taking their cookies -- it was weird. Taking their cookies and stuff like that. We had another separation where they were having sexual relationship through the chain link fence. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Now, this week, I believe finally, the Trump administration has reunited officially under a court order, the families -- so-called families-- the ones that actually were families, but I just want to get your take on some of these people down there. Yes, there were innocent children that were separated and that was very a hard thing to watch and experience. But some of these people weren't their parents. Other people were human smugglers, drug traffickers and some of these minors -- 16, 17, 15 -- some hard-core people. HOMAN: Of course, I am going to talk about Governor Cuomo real quick what ICE has done on the border about family separations. He needs to learn the difference between Border Patrol and ICE first of all. You want to (inaudible) an agency for something that another agency does. I support what the Border Patrol did. I believe in family separations because if you get arrested and get prosecuted for a crime just like any American family, you're going to get separated. But getting back to these kids, Operation Matador, an MS-13 operation that ICE did in New York on Long Island, New York last year, 40 percent of the MS-13 people we arrested entered this country as unaccompanied alien children. WATTERS: You're kidding me. HOMAN: No, no. So, some of these children I feel bad for them. I feel bad for the plight of some of these people, but when you violate laws in this country, you've got be held accountable. But understand, when we talk about separating the children, the vast majority of these children are between the ages of 15 and 17. These aren't toddlers we're talking about. WATTERS: And I just think that people that are watching this need to understand the realistic scenario down there at the border. It's not a bunch of kids with popsicles coming across in strollers. It's a very vicious and dangerous situation, and we're trying to be humanitarian, but at the same time, you're trying to protect the country. Now, Nancy Pelosi says the Democrats are the ones that are really protecting the borders. And guess what she'd called 9/11. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: When we had the 9/11 incident and the Commission was formed and made the recommendations, they made recommendations to protect America. But the Republicans would never take them up, and some of it was about our borders. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: I don't know what's more preposterous, her calling 9/11 an incident or her claiming the Democrats are stronger on border security. HOMAN: I was asked about this earlier this morning and my first response was, what color is the sky in her world? I've seen her make a lot of preposterous statements, but come on, I mean, does she support the border wall? WATTERS: No. HOMAN: And that's going to affect her replace-ability. Do they support shutting down the loopholes on immigration? Let's talk about why family separation. You know why families are separated? Because her and a lot of people that are with her, fail to fix the loopholes that cause these families to come to the border. So, I've said it a hundred times. I'll say it a hundred times more. There has been nobody that has done more for border security and public safety than President Trump and I've worked for six presidents. I respect them all, but nobody has done more than this administration and President Trump. That's just a stone cold fact from a guy that has done it for 34 years. WATTERS: All right, Tom. Well, thank you for your service, and President Trump needs a little help on Capitol Hill if he wants to get everything straightened out down there. I appreciate you coming in. HOMAN: I appreciate you, sir. WATTERS: All right, the so-called tolerant left out of control. Ready? A black gay Army veteran who has had enough of their bullying tactics has now come out as a Republican. He'll be here next. MARIANNE RAFFERTY, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Marianne Rafferty. Family members now confirming that three people missing in a northern California wildfire have died bringing the death toll to five since flames broke out on Monday. The fire has destroyed hundreds of homes and forced about 37,000 people to evacuate and experts warn conditions could worsen with high winds and more scorching heat in the forecast. And the Trump administration saying it has met the deadline to reunite all eligible children aged five to seventeen with their families at the border, but that there are about 700 children who do not qualify for reunification due to safety concerns like a parent's criminal history. The government is also saying that more than 400 parents have been deported and that officials said they would work with the courts to figure out a process for reunification. I'm Marianne Rafferty. Now back to \"Watters' World.\" WATTERS: Trump derangement syndrome among the liberals is out of control. This week, a vandal destroyed President Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a pickax. Two years after another vandal defaced it, and this comes just weeks after an innocent 16 year old boy was attacked in a restaurant for wearing his \"Make America Great Again\" hat. And a protester climbed the Statue of Liberty all in the name of illegal immigration. What's wrong with the so-called left? I thought they were supposed to be tolerant. My next guest is a black gay Army veteran who was a Democrat. He became so fed up with the outrageous bullying from liberals that he switched parties and became a Republican. Rob Smith joins me now. All right, so Rob, you grew up as a Democrat. ROB SMITH, ARMY VETERAN: Absolutely. WATTERS: What made you switch parties to become a Republican? SMITH: I think that for me, I got so sick of the lies. Specifically what they were telling black people. So, when you are a black person you get these messages from Democrats, it says that you are a victim. It says that you need us to succeed, you need us to achieve, you need this ever expanding welfare state to be able to make something of yourself. And for me, I got so tired of it and I got sick of that message that I needed them, and I got sick of that message of victimhood that they continue to push to black Americans over and over and over again for the last three decades of my life. WATTERS: Now, I believe the reason that the Democratic Party does that to people, that even are curious about leaving the Democratic Party, they need strong party discipline. They can't allow their base, whether it's Hispanics, whether its blacks, whether it's young women or young millennials, they can't allow them to think outside the box and even entertain becoming a Republican or even listen to Republican ideas because they need those votes come November. SMITH: They need those votes come November and also what they want to do is they want to keep people in line. I think democrats use identity politics to keep people in line, to keep black people in line, to keep Latinos in line. To keep gay people in line. I'm black and buy gay, and I have seen them use the same tactics for black people as they do for gay people. WATTERS: Was it harder for you to come out as a Republican or harder to come out as a gay American? SMITH: Well, here's the thing, I never lost -- I didn't lose friends when I came out as gay. I've lost friends since coming out as a Republican. People do not understand it, and these are the left that's supposed to be so tolerant and so inclusive, and these are the people that were the first to shun me when I came out as a conservative Republican. WATTERS: We have some messages, I guess on social media. This one guy says, \"Look at all the approval you are getting from white people. Is this why you do this for? Black people need to stop saying what white people want they want to hear and come together and deal with our issues as a people, not sell out to the people who caused them harm in the first place.\" When you read something like that, how does that make you feel? SMITH: It doesn't make me feel great. I mean, I have been called everything but child of God since I came out as a Republican. They call you sell out, they call you Uncle Tom, they call you all these things, but I think that the idea is why can't I have different ideas? Why can't I be free thinking? Why can't I have a victor mentality? Why do all of these things that I am thinking of that I think could benefit me and other people that look like me, it doesn't always have something to do with white people? It could just be that there are different ideas that I'm connecting to more. WATTERS: All right, speaking of different ideas. We are just going to play this because it's just kind of interesting to watch. Roseanne Barr was on Sean Hannity's show the other night. We all remember what Roseanne said and how she was fired and why she was fired. Well, this is the first TV interview that she did since that firing from ABC and here is what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROSEANNE BARR, AMERICAN ACTRESS: America is a place where I, a loud mouthed, old, gorgeous, Jewish woman comedian am allowed freedom of speech. They were saying it was racial when it's political. I wish I had worded it better, but I'm not going to let them tell me what I meant. I'm not a racist and the people who voted for Trump, they are not racist either, and Trump isn't a racist. Sorry. When things are going too far right, I'm going to go a low left, and when things are going too far left, I am going to go a little right. I like the middle opinion that balances two extremes. Most people in America I think, think like that. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Well, she never should have said what she said or tweeted about Valerie Jarett the way she did that was really, really bad, but what do you think about her explanation and her asking for forgiveness? SMITH: I completely accept it. Look, I am one of the few black people who did not think that she should have lost her job after those comments. WATTERS: Why not? SMITH: For me, because I don't think that they were racist. To me, when you look at Valley Jarrett, it's not too far outside of the realm of possibility for somebody to think that Valerie Jarrett is white. There are a lot of people that don't know she is very ambiguously ethnic. So, I didn't take that -- it's a very negative comment and it was a nasty comment. I don't know if it's necessarily racial. That's not how I took it, but then as Americans, do we give people an opportunity to apologize? Do we give people an opportunity to be contrite? But no, they didn't give her that opportunity. They wanted to shut her down and what I think the left does, what I think Democrats do is they use accusations of racism. They use those words to shut people down and get rid of those people, and by the way, the same people that wanted Roseanne fired are the same people that are rallying behind James Gunn. WATTERS: Right, the other guy that made all of those horrible pedophiles. SMITH: That made the horrible pedophile jokes on Twitter, so the same people that call for Roseanne to be fired are the same ones that are rallying behind James Gunn and saying that it wasn't correct that he got fired. WATTERS: All right, Rob, thank you very much. Appreciate it. SMITH: Thank you. WATTERS: The New York Times has posted its summer fun guide, but if you're a white guy, don't even bother. Wait until you hear what they said right back from the break. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you're drunk in Midtown doing cheap coke off of your laundry card, I have just the place for you. New York's hottest club is garish and fired by true events. This one with CBS which became a choice bank and then became a CBS again has a familiar yet, troubling feel, like when Larry King would play himself in a movie. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: The New York Times has come out with their list of the hottest events for the summer called, \"The Ultimate Guide to this Fabulous Summer\" including man-free zones, a leather weekend, a trans pageant, a bunch of witches meeting in the woods, and a Two Spirit gathering. But don't bother if you are a straight white man, you probably are not going to be welcome at several of these events. They actually say that. Liberal commentator Cathy Areu is here to fill me on what's been going on and what I've been missing out on -- I mean, I'm probably not welcome to some of these stuff, but what is witch camp? And why does the \"New York Times\" want you to go to witch camp? CATHY AREU, LIBERAL COMMENTATOR: I don't know if they want you to go, they are just letting you know about it. But you learn about witch craft and everything to do with potions and. WATTERS: Potions? AREU: Yes, yes, things that are a little bit anti-male and pro-woman and yes. WATTERS: Potions. Witches are anti-male. AREU: Well, this witch camp in particular I think is for women only. WATTERS: Are you going to be going to witch camp? AREU: No, I don't need to go. WATTERS: No? AREU: No. I'm fluent in watch. WATTERS: You ride around in your broomstick and cast spells. AREU: Yes, I am comfortable. Yes, I am comfortable with that, yes. WATTERS: Okay, and so, they is also a two-spirit gathering in Montana. What is a two spirit gathering? AREU: A two spirit -- I think it's with the Native Americans. That's a non-binary meeting in -- is that the one? WATTERS: I mean, is Elizabeth Warren going to be there? AREU: She could be, yes, because she is part Indian, so part Native American. WATTERS: Okay, so she says. Not Indian. AREU: Sorry -- I know, I know. WATTERS: Cathy, it's Native American. AREU: Native American. WATTERS: Try to clean it up. AREU: I'm sorry. WATTERS: All right, and they also have things men can't go and I think in Sweden, only sis gender men. What is sis gender? AREU: Sis gender is how you identify yourself, so it could be as a man, not as a man, so it's your choice. WATTERS: So, I could identify as a woman and go, but if I go as a man, I can't? AREU: Yes, pretty much. WATTERS: Okay, that's fascinating. All right, let's talk about something that's even more fascinating. In the University of Minnesota, they are considering new guidelines. If you mispronounce someone, so if you say \"he\" when that person identifies as a she, you can get in big trouble. AREU: Or the other way around. WATTERS: Or the other way around. AREU: Or Ze or Zoe. There are many. WATTERS: What is Ze and Zoe? AREU: Well, those are different pronouns, gender neutral pronouns. WATTERS: What does Zoe mean? AREU: Well, it could be what you want it to mean. I mean, that's the beauty of it. You can pick your own. WATTERS: What gender is Zoe? AREU: Well, it's the gender you want it to be. WATTERS: You can just make up the gender out of thin air? AREU: You could choose your own gender pronoun for yourself, yes. WATTERS: Well, how is the person addressing you supposed to know which pronoun to use? AREU: You would let that person know what gender you would want to be called and then you would have to respect that. So the university knows what its student population wants for a healthy learning environment and it's creating that community of respect and equality. WATTERS: And you support this? AREU: I think it's -- they know best. They know their students best. WATTERS: They do? AREU: Yes. So I support them supporting their students. WATTERS: Okay. AREU: Yes. WATTERS: Go Golden Goafers. Lastly, we have the war on straws, Cathy, so I guess, Santa Barbara City Council is saying straws are bad because they are plastic and if you run a restaurant and you hand out straws to your patrons and if you get caught doing that, handing out plastic straws, you can face fines and up to six months in jail for straws. AREU: For straws, yes. It's bad for the environment. So actually, it's bad for everyone. So this is helping everyone. It's for all of us. It's for all of our states. WATTERS: Okay, so they don't lock up criminal illegal aliens in California. AREU: Well, undocumented. WATTERS: They lock up straw distributors. AREU: People, you mean? No one is illegal. WATTERS: When you come across the border illegally, that makes you illegal. AREU: Well, a person can't be illegal. It can be undocumented, but never illegal. WATTERS: Well, I am calling them illegal because they are breaking the law. AREU: But I am sure -- so I am sure they are tackling their immigration issues and they are tackling their drug issues and they are tackling other issues, and they are taking care of all of us by taking care of the environment. WATTERS: Okay, well I don't know if they have their priorities straight over there in California. That's all I'm saying. AREU: They are helping all of us. How can those priorities be wrong? WATTERS: Okay, Cathy, thank you. Coming up. See this girl right here? Her boyfriend dumped her. Want to know why? He wanted to play more video games. That's right. He broke up with her because he wanted to play more video games. Diamond and Silk react, next. A Georgia state lawmaker being forced to resign his office following a very disturbing appearance on \"Borat's\" show, Sasha Baron Cohen, the show is called, \"Who is America.\" Watch what happens as Republican Jason Spencer meets with Cohen who he thought was an Israeli expert to film an anti- terrorism training video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SASHA BARON COHEN, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: Because of who you are, you could be the victim of kidnapping by ISIS. In America, there is one forbidden word. It is the \"N\" word. You have three seconds to attack the tension, go. JASON SPENCER, AMERICAN POLITICIAN: [Bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]. COHEN: You crazy -- the \"N\" word is looney, not this word. If your buttock touch them, it means they have become a. SPENCER: Homosexual. COHEN: We say in the Mossad, I mean, not in the Mossad, if you want to win, you show some skin. Go. SPENCER: Go, go. USA, USA. [Bleep]. COHEN: Okay, you show me your weapon, go. SPENCER: I'll touch you and make you a homosexual, you drop that gun right now. USA, USA. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Joining me now, Diamond and Silk. Ladies, you have got to have a better BS meter than that. I mean, come on. What was this guy thinking? DIAMOND, VIDEO BLOGGER: I can't believe he was so naive to fall for that. He is a lawmaker, so there should be some type of code of conduct where you don't drop it like it's hot, so people could see your derriere, nor do you use derogatory language, so I think that she should have stepped down because he doesn't have a sense of direction nor a sense of knowledge to know that certain things, you just don't do. But also, if he stepped down, other people should step down, too, like that one that keeps running around talking about, \"We've got to impeach 45.\" SILK, VIDEO BLOGGER: Impeach 45. DIAMOND: She should also step down, too. SILK: That's right. WATTERS: All right, ladies, did you hear me the other day, I forget what show it was on, I had a buddy who is out in California, and he ran into Maxine Waters at a $100.00 a head brunch at the Four Seasons, and she admitted to him that Donald Trump, because of the good economy was going to get re-elected in 2020. Can you believe that? DIAMOND: Oh, good for her. She knows it. SILK: Maybe she got a message from God. DIAMOND: Yes. WATTERS: She sure did. All right, next one, we have Elizabeth Warren as the President likes to call her, Pocahontas, and she made a pretty nasty accusation saying that the President is trying to turn races against each other. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIZABETH WARREN, US SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS, DEMOCRAT: Donald Trump identifies the real problem in America and that is a lot of folks are hurting. And then he takes a turn and says, and it's the fault of those people. People who don't look like you. People who don't sound like you. People who don't worship like you. People who are not the same color and who didn't speak the same language. Fill in the blanks. It is their fault. What he wants to do is pit working people against working people -- black working people against white working people. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: I mean, I don't see that. I do see this though, illegal immigration has a very negative impact on wages and it drives down wages for regular hard-working Americans blacks and whites, and legal Hispanics. I think that's what the President is talking about, not trying to incite a race war. DIAMOND: That's exactly what the President is talking about. But it's a shame that Pocahontas don't even realizes that what the President is doing is bringing our country together, following the law. Something that they are not used to doing. But remember now, she is a left-leaning liberal -- a Democrat. She don't have a message. They are a mess over there, so they will race bait in order to get a vote. That's what they always do. So we have to ignore them. We know what the president is doing and we are so happy that he's making this place greater than we have ever seen it before. SILK: And this is one of the tactics of these type of individuals. We call them the gate keepers, the dog whistlers. It's what they do. They try to instill some type of fear in people and push, push it off on somebody else, when actually, it's them that's doing all of the race baiting and being divisive. WATTERS: I don't think people are even buying it anymore. So moving on. There is a woman, I think her name is Yanet Garcia. She is a weather girl. One of the most of famous weather girls, I think in the entire world and everybody wants to date her. She is a very eligible bachelorette as they say, so she gets together with this guy. This guy's name is Douglas Martin. Douglas Martin is a video game player. He is a professional gamer. So, they are dating for a while and things are going great, and this guy Douglas dumps this woman here -- dumps, Yanet Garcia because he wants to dedicate more time to playing video games full time. Can you guys believe it? DIAMOND: Well, listen, any time a man wants to play a video game over you, that means he's just not that into you. SILK: That's right. DIAMOND: So, really, her rejection -- that rejection was probably for her protection, but what I can say is showing your goodies to everybody. Acting like you're just some bread on a shelf instead of a diamond behind a glass, that's probably why people keep dropping your you know what, so you might as well keep your goodies to yourself. You don't have to let the world see everything as a woman. SILK: That's right. For men, they like illusions instead of the real thing. DIAMOND: Right. WATTERS: Well, he likes \"Call of Duty,\" the video game. I think that's pretty clear. All right, Diamond and Silk, everybody. Check out the Chit- Chat Tour taking over the country. Up next, late night hosts turn on James Comey. Unbelievable. Watch this. Time now for \"Last Call.\" Late night turning on James Comey this week as the former FBI Director took to Twitter to urge Americans to vote for moderate Democrats, not socialists in the midterms. Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler had a little fun with that. SETH MEYERS, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: Really, James Comey? You want to weigh in on things when there is an election is coming up? You feel like that's gone well for you in the past? It's like Michael Jordan saying, \"I think I'm going to take another shot at baseball.\" I mean, really? AMY POEHLER, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: Really? James Comey? You're worried the Democrats are going to move too far to the left? Really? I don't know if you remember, but we were just about to have a nice boring moderate Democrat for president until you decided to open your mouth a week before the election, you big dumb scarecrow. MEYERS: Really? POEHLER: Really? And as far as I'm concerned, the Democrats can vote for a bong in the shape of Che Guevarra and you've got nothing to say about it. Really? MEYERS: Really? I'll take your political advice as soon as I'm done with my Jeffrey Dahmer cookbook and my Harvey Weinstein fitness tapes. POEHLER: The idea of you playing adviser to the Democratic Party is kind of like the iceberg trying to join the crew of the Titanic. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Congratulations, James Comey, everybody now hates you. All right, so we did a little poll and it was about my hair and here are the results. The winner? What haircut? 34 percent of you didn't even notice the difference. Come on, guys? Shorter on the sides, pushed back to the side, Come on. Anyway, that's all for us tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" is next, and remember, I'm Watters and this is my world.

This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" October 18, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And we are coming to you from South Florida, at the EIB southern command headquarters where for the full hour tonight, I'll sit down with radio legend, Rush Limbaugh, for wide-ranging interview on everything that is at stake in November. With just 19 days until the single most important midterm elections in our lifetime, the fate of the Senate, the House, all hangs in the balance. So, it is up to you to send a message to the Democratic Party that mob rule is not acceptable in the U.S. And tonight, we'll set the stage. We'll break down multiple key races, preview what will happen. God forbid, if Pelosi's speaker, Schumer is the Senate majority leader, and they take the reins of government. Now, my interview with Rush is coming up. You're not going to want to miss a second. First, it's time for a special Florida edition of our opening monologue. (MUSIC) HANNITY: Less than three weeks until the single most important midterm elections in our lifetime. Democrats, the destroy Trump media, continue their all-out smear campaign against the president and his supporters, and clearly, they're not backing down. Instead of calling for civility, civil discourse, Democratic leaders continue cheerleading for this dangerous mob- like behavior. When two people in Minnesota punched and attacked, we had representatives, Republicans, hit, over all of this. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about. REP. MAXINE WATER, D-CALIF.: If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get up and you create a crowd, and you pushback on them, and you tell them they are not welcome anymore, anywhere. SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: Please, don't just come here today and then go home, go to the Hill today. Get up and please get up in the face of some Congress people. ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: Michelle always says that, you know, when they go low, we go high. No, no. When they go low, we kick them. ELLEN DEGENERES, TV HOST: If you had to be stuck in an elevator with either President Trump, Mike Pence, or Jeff Sessions, who would it be? SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: Does one of us have to come out alive? (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: I've been very clear on this program, if this type of rhetoric continues, it is not going to end well. So, tonight, the political climate is at a fever pitch. We've seen violent protests in major cities all across the country, Portland, New York. We have seen women, violent assaults against them. Two local Republican candidates in Minnesota, a Democratic operative arrested in Nevada, for battery against a GOP campaign manager, that operative has now been fired. Senator Susan Collins and her staff repeatedly have been threatened, and a package was sent to Susan Collins' house, well, purportedly containing the chemical ricin. Other Republicans have been stalked, harassed, all over the country, run out of restaurants, chased down in airports, and much more. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PROTESTERS: We believe survivors! We believe survivors! We believe survivors! PROTESTERS: We call on you to end family separation! Abolish ICE! Abolish ICE! (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: This kind of a mob-like behavior has got to stop before somebody gets hurt, as Rand Paul has said, or worse. Violence, intimidation, unacceptable in this country. Our problems -- well, you have a chance to solve the problems at the ballot box in 19 days. That's why I'm down here in Florida, because Rush and I both believe we're in a political climate, unlike any other time in recent history, and guess what? There has never been a greater urgency to speak out collectively, to continue the agenda that has been working for two years, or reverse course. Fundamental principles we believe in, due process, presumption of innocence, that's at play. The economy is in play. Peace and prosperity, national security is in play. The country is at a tipping point in more ways than we can even begin. So, without further ado, we are in the studio of Rush Limbaugh. First, I want to congratulate you. Thirty years, talk radio, the king of talk radio, and going stronger than ever. RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: It's amazing, it really is. You know, I'm enjoying it as much as I ever have, if not more so. I get more thrills from it. I get more satisfaction from it, than I've ever had. If you would've told me 30 years ago, or even 40, when I was dreaming of all this, that by the time I reached 65, that it would be more competitive than ever, that I would be more involved -- I thought 65, well, you got nothing left to prove. You phone it in, you take it easy, go to the beach, do a couple hours a week, and that's it, like Johnny Carson did. I can't imagine not doing this. And I think largely because of -- as you just laid out, we are seriously at a tipping point. I don't know -- I worry -- I don't know how many people actually are aware of how close we are to losing our country as founded. There's always going to be in America but what is it going to be? And it really is at stake. I've been trying in I don't how many ways to explain to my audience why it is different now than it was 15 years ago, or 20. And I do it by trying to analyze who the left is. What they have become. I am naive in many ways. HANNITY: I might take a little objection to Rush being naive. You -- LIMBAUGH: Well, you tell me if this is naive. HANNITY: Yes. LIMBAUGH: I look at what happened during the Kavanaugh hearing. You just described ricin and the stuff to Susan Collins. We looked at the literal mob behavior that was inspired, bought and paid for, by the Democrat Party. \u00a0The media encourages it. In my naive world, that behavior would secure the biggest landslide defeat a political party has ever had. In a sane world, where decent people are the majority, that would be rejected out of hand. It wouldn't even be considered relevant. And the people of this country would want to get rid of that as quickly as they could. But yet, it may be close to 50 percent of the country. I don't think it is, and I hope not. But the fact that it continues to survive, I have evolved a bunch of theories to explain it. And I really think -- by the way, interrupt any time with questions. HANNITY: No, you are doing great. LIMBAUGH: I really think that all of this -- the vast majority of it, still, Sean, revolves around one of the age-old arguments that left versus right has had, that is role of government in our lives. Now, the people on the left, I read some of what Jim Garrity at \"National Review,\" about a month ago now, and it just struck me, because I think it is dead on. I'm going to paraphrase what he said. He said, what has happened, in his view -- I endorse this even more than he does. I think it is a bigger point than he made it. These people on the left that you've described, the mob behavior, is really a series of psychological disorders that have taken over politics. We have politicized psychological disorders to the pointing out that they have become the objective of the Democrat Party. Solving all of these disparate, separate psychological disorders, having the government do it, basically determine outcomes. And get even with oppressors, the founding majority of the country. That's what we are dealing with. If we don't define this properly, we are never going to be able to oppose it. If we consider the stuff legit, which it isn't, that kind of behavior is not legitimate. We do not want a country based on that kind -- we don't want people winning elections based on mobs and violence. Think if that happens. If they win the election based on this kind of behavior -- HANNITY: We'll get more of it. LIMBAUGH: Exactly right. HANNITY: But here's -- LIMBAUGH: What do decent people do? Decent people do not spend all day trying to figure out how to battle this. Decent people are living their lives. We've got perversion, indecency, corruption, up against what used to be called normalcy. HANNITY: You've got -- Hillary Clinton -- we can't be civil unless you give us power back. Eric Holder, well, they go low, we kick them. LIMBAUGH: Right. HANNITY: \u00a0Maxine waters, if you see them, create a crowd. You know, go tell them, follow them into department stores and grocery stores and gas stations. You are not wanted anywhere anymore. And we saw Pam Bondi, Secretary Nielsen, and we saw Sarah Sanders, Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi, Mitch McConnell, I think Rand is right. Somebody is going to get hurt here, in the end, because -- look, I blame the people for their actions, but there is certainly marching orders here. Confront, attack, get in their faces -- LIMBAUGH: All of it is marching orders. HANNITY: Yes. LIMBAUGH: All of it is bought and paid for. Look at this caravan. \u00a0Supposed -- where is it? Honduras, Guatemala, doesn't matter. Somebody is paying for this. Where are these people going to the bathroom? Who is feeding them? I mean, 2,000, 4,000 people, kids, and that's the magic. And they put the children in there. We must accept them. We can't send them away, it's so horrible. Trump is separating -- it is all designed and it's all designed to flood the zone during the election. We've got this, we've got worried about the Fed raising interest rates to try to jam down the economy, way over there, guess what just happened? \u00a0Robert Mueller is about ready to submit his report. Well, Justice Department rules and guidelines say they should not do it to impact the results of an election. But that didn't -- Comey did, didn't he? He was doing everything he could to help Hillary, people don't understand this, but that's what he'd been doing. So, these things are all planned and they're all getting focused leading up to the election. People ask me, what can I do? I want to do more than vote. Right now, that is the answer. HANNITY: Vote. LIMBAUGH: I mean, people -- I know people think their vote is not enough, but it is. Turnout is everything. And the left -- this is almost an identical scenario to 2016. They think, Sean, they really do -- and some of this is hope, but they think a lot of Americans that voted for Trump regret it. A lot of people can't out to show and apologize for their mistake of voting for Trump. \u00a0They can't wait to go out there and apologize to the Democrat Party. The fact of the matter is, since Barack Obama, the Democrat Party has been losing elections. Starting in 2010, midterm, state party, all the way up to 2016, the Democrat Party has lost 1,200 seats, national, state, local. \u00a0You have to count all the way down to the dog catcher, they have lost. \u00a0They have the least amount of electoral political power in Washington since the '20s. Where is this blue wave? Where's the evidence that people can't wait to vote Democrat? The evidence is they are doing the exact opposite. Trump is out there continuing to do the things he did that won him the election in 2016, all of these rallies. They have been unable to get rid of him. They have thrown everything at Trump that usually gets rid t of Republican opponents, and nothing has worked. And they're just frustrated as they can be, and I think they are so overplaying this, and they are going way beyond the bounds of anywhere near propriety. But they think most Americans want to be encouraged to do mob- like behavior, getting people's faces. I don't think we have lost the country to that extent that that wins elections. HANNITY: How big an impact -- Kavanaugh, to me, was a tipping point, because they were exposed. I think most people fundamentally believe in the rule of law, the Constitution, due process, presumption of innocence. \u00a0There was none of that. It was accusation, I believe it. LIMBAUGH: Look how close they were to getting away with that, though. HANNITY: Yes. LIMBAUGH: You and I watched this from a different perspective than I think a lot of people. Sadly, there are still a lot of people that only get their news from what we call the mainstream media. If Donald Trump -- President Trump had not, at that rally, exposed Christine -- HANNITY: No corroboration. LIMBAUGH: None! The four people she says where there, no, we weren't. \u00a0She didn't know what, where, when, why. So, Trump tells people this, and they get mad at Trump for mocking her. Trump didn't mock her. To mock her, he would have to impersonate her. \u00a0Which I can do, but I will not. HANNITY: You are showing great restraint. LIMBAUGH: Great restraint. He didn't mock her, he exposed her to a bunch of Americans who didn't know, because the mainstream media had not reported all of the holes in her story. So, Trump does, and in getting Trump, they end up reporting what Trump said. That was the tipping point, plus what Kavanaugh did to save himself. But you're right, presumption of innocence gone. They were close to killing that by intimidating Republican on that committee. But it didn't work again because I believe the president came in and saved the day. HANNITY: Look, I don't have a crystal ball. I always thought and believed in my heart the media is wrong, Trump can win. You can see it, you can feel it. I don't know who is going to run against Obama in '08. You saw the crowds, you saw the enthusiasm, in that case, I think it was a lot of hype and no change, typical left-wing policies. You predicted to me that it would fail, and it did fail. But something is different. President Trump -- you could see building momentum. And now, we got these midterms. I'm looking at let's -- Florida, they could pick up a Senate seat. I think you could pick one up in Missouri. I think you will hold Nevada. I think you will win in Arizona, North Dakota, Indiana, all potential pickups. Where I would worry about more is the House, I don't have a feel. LIMBAUGH: It is hard, so many seats there. So many variables, and vagaries when you get to it. But let's look at this in the macro way. Let's compare this -- you want to go to 2008 -- let's go back to 2016. I know you were, early on, very confident that Trump was going to win. I thought -- my staff here will tell me that two days -- when I first saw the first polling after Trump and Melania went down the escalator, I said, he is the nominee. It is going to happen, I felt it. You know why? Because I know the bond, I saw those rallies. I saw the bond that Trump had with his voters. The media didn't create that. He did. I did versions of that when my show started traveling around, 48 weekends a year for the first two years, trying to get my radio show established. And I saw similar a success track. And nobody can blow up that bond that Trump voters have, but Washington establishment, to this day, does not understand Donald Trump. They don't understand his voters, and they are not curious to find out why. They just resent it. And they are still operating under the same rules they operated under in 2016, and the parallels are identical here. They think in 2016, Hillary is going to win. Massive landslide, measuring the curtains, Hillary's planning all of these things. The deep state guys back then are confident nobody is going to ever know what they did, their jobs and careers will be safe. Strzok and all of these clowns, McCabe, safe. Then, Trump comes along and wins. They are shocked, they are stunned, they couldn't believe it. Same thing now, they think they have won the House a month ago. It's in the can. They are just waiting for the calendar and the days to go by, when all of their own point data shows the so-called generic ballot blue wave shrinking and shrinking. HANNITY: Dramatically. LIMBAUGH: Now you find less confidence in all of the reporting about the blue wave, so now we have the caravan, they tried Kavanaugh. Look at all of the October surprises. Feinstein tried one. Pocahontas ,Elizabeth Warren, how about this, folks. We used to be judged by the content of our character. Now it is the content of our DNA. Is that what the Democrat Party -- talk about bastardizing Martin Luther King. She bombs out. Feinstein bombs out. HANNITY: Right. LIMBAUGH: And so, all of these -- all four were attempted, were purposed, to blow Trump up, and he just keeps beating them back. And they don't know how to deal with it. They get more and more frustrated, more and more angry. That's what we're seeing. HANNITY: Some nights at the end of the show, we'll take a clip from, your Dittocam, and run it. Kind of the kicker to the show. My audience loves to see you, thanks for doing the show. They love having you, as do I. What if they win? What if the Democrats win? You love that question. LIMBAUGH: Well, the problem here is, I am on television, and I'm really trying to be persuasive, I don't want to dramatize it. I do not want to lie to people and I don't want to fill people with phony, manipulative, emotional things. But it might serve to answer that question to go back -- what if Hillary had won in 2016? Stop and think of that. There wouldn't be a roaring economy. There wouldn't have been any tax cuts, there would not have been rollback on regulations, no squaring of the deal with NATO. There wouldn't have been any read on trade deals. The Obama administration told the American people, get used to it, there is a new American economy, and it is flat line or in decline. America's past, we didn't really deserve that. America was founded by a white patriarchy set itself up for itself, people discriminated against, but those days are over. So, now, the days behind us, we didn't deserve those anyway. We don't deserve to be a superpower. We have a flat line economy. We were told -- Obama is out there in Indiana telling these people their jobs are never coming back. And some in the audience, \"Mr. Trump says\" and Obama says, what is he going to do, wave a magic wand? Look what happened, we got the jobs back. It can be done. They don't even want to make America great. They resent the whole idea of America becoming great. They resent the idea of America as a superpower, running the world for good. We're the good guys. They don't think so. (CROSSTAK) HANNITY: If -- and the investigation -- LIMBAUGH: If he hadn't won, Sean, I shudder to think, with Hillary Clinton in the White House and all of her cronies in all the cabinet positions, and the validation of all of these odd ball, weird, perverted, left-wing behaviors becoming more and more normalized, and politics and government role being to address their grievances -- we have become a country of nothing but a bunch of victims constantly angry, demanding that somebody do something about it, instead of all of us -- as we used to do -- using self- reliance and our own initiatives and our guts and handling life ourselves HANNITY: Stay there. We'll take a break. We're just getting started. LIMBAUGH: Not moving. HANNITY: We'll continue. More with Rush Limbaugh, with us for the full hour. We are at his southern command headquarters, EIB Network. Please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. As we continue, southern command, Rush Limbaugh EIB headquarters, this is it. This is where you do your show. LIMBAUGH: It really is. HANNITY: \u00a0Every day. LIMBAUGH: There is an ordinance in Palm Beach, you cannot work from your home -- and so, which is fine, it is the case, so we built this, and it is like a living room, home office. Can I do one thing personal? Every time I am on your show, people ask me what this is. I get emails, what is this? HANNITY: Right, your calculator implant. LIMBAUGH: Well, yes, it's a direct aligned to the West Wing is what it is. (LAUGHTER) LIMBAUGH: No, these are cochlear implants. I'm deaf, I am 100 percent deaf, and I can only hear bionically with these. Very quickly, the human ear has 35,000 hair cells each, they determine and the sensitivity of the human hearing. I don't have it. Mine are dead, they laid down and died. Autoimmune. So I have eight man-made, biological electrodes -- bionic electrodes that try to do what 35,000 hair cells do. And it's a miraculous thing. If this had happened -- if I lost my hearing 15 years before I did, it would have been the end of my career, because the tech had not been invented. It is really fortunate, and I look at it as something to be extremely grateful. HANNITY: I remember in the interim time -- not to get too distracted, we got a lot to talk about. I do radio, as you do. I do not know how it's possible. It's like most people in radio, DJs, talk shows, I am cranking that thing up. And dramatic hearing loss after 30 years. LIMBAUGH: I did three months totally deaf, I couldn't get surgery done because I had an infection. So, three months. So, you rely on how your voice feels. HANNITY: Right. LIMBAUGH: And you have to consciously tell yourself, don't -- when you can't hear, you speak up. HANNITY: Right. LIMBAUGH: You have to tell yourself -- I asked of them, asked the doctors, if I don't do this, can I speak normally for the rest of my life? They said no. If you can't hear yourself speak, you will end up sounding like someone who has not heard before, so that you have to do the implants. But that's what they are. They were really a career saver. HANNITY: Thank God, you are still here and going strong, 30th anniversary, which was a big deal. For those of us that followed behind you, it's a big deal because you did forge a path for all of us. And we all owe you a debt of gratitude. That's why, really, I wanted to be here. Explain the Trump phenomenon. \u00a0Maybe we have a more unique perspective because we both knew him way before he ever thought about running. LIMBAUGH: Right. I don't think it is hard to understand the Trump phenomenon at all. If you are not poison -- I use that as an exaggeration -- if you are not affected by inside the Beltway or Washington establishment thinking, understanding Trump is easy. It's elite versus real people. It's somebody that is fearless and willing to fight against the things that no Republican has been willing to fight against or defend. He's got an engaging personality. He doesn't offend people -- the left thinks he does because they act offended, but Trump just makes people laugh. They can't get over the fact that he is likable because they hate him. They despise him. I saw today - - are we allowed to mention competing cable networks? Because you dominate everything. They're just a bunch of -- (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: Little Brian Stelter over on CNN. HANNITY: Humpty-dumpty. LIMBAUGH: It's what you call him. HANNITY: That is what I call him. Humpty-dumpty. LIMBAUGH: He has actually been somewhat nice to me, there are exceptions to it. But complaining that the president is talking too much, the president is in the media too much. This is a guy demand free access -- because he is polluting the air. He is lying, he's distorting, and he's not giving us enough time to catch up with him and to correct him. That's just keep going. President Trump, he is dominating these people. He is frustrating them. \u00a0They've lost their monopoly. The Elizabeth Warren thing, the Pocahontas, proves they cannot shape public opinion anymore via narrative, and they are frustrated as they can be about that. HANNITY: He doesn't need them. LIMBAUGH: No. Part of the process -- part what is going on here, I believe, all of this -- I do call it abnormality. We are up against psychological disorder, abnormality, that is disguised as political issues. HANNITY: We talk about the media -- it has never been this abusively biased. LIMBAUGH: Well, it's not even biased. They're so far beyond biased. \u00a0These people are part of the agenda. I think they run it. I think they are the people that orchestrate it, run it, in fact, even give some marching orders to each other. The point is, Trump has just got them bamboozled. I think part and parcel of what they are doing is trying to demonstrate to themselves they still have the power to shape public opinion via narrative. And it's causing all of these people on the left to get more and more and more extreme. And I'm just relying on the fact that average, ordinary Americans, like you and I are, are as repulsed as you and I are by this behavior that they are engaging in, the demands they are making on decent, god-fearing, America- loving people. We are not the problem. And yet we are portrayed as the problem. We're the enemy to these people. It's really scary. What happens when we lose, go back and look -- if we lose 2016, if they get the House, well, I'm just going to tell you, whatever Trump wants to do is going to stop. It's going to be paralyzed. \u00a0It's going to be nothing but in every House committee that is relevant, inspections, investigations, subpoenas. They are going to go back and try to get Kavanaugh thrown out. It is going to be nothing but two years to get even with Trump for having the audacity to win. And the business of the nation is going to be brought to a screeching halt. In the meantime, they are going to try to get rid of the tax cuts. They're not going to succeed at any of this because the Senate is still going to be in the hands of Mitch McConnell, I especially him colonel. He moves so slow, but his speed he is really getting good. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: He had a good run for what he-- (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: And in the judicial. HANNITY: He did not on Gorsuch and on Kavanaugh, he's great. LIMBAUGH: But I still think Trump -- that's and whom I have come in terms of the politics of this, I still have implicit trust. I think Trump knows what he is doing. HANNITY: Here's my question. We've had all the success in two years. Obama, economically, the first president that never met 3 percent of GDP growth in history. LIMBAUGH: He didn't want to. This is the key. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: It didn't happen. LIMBAUGH: America doesn't deserve that. HANNITY: Yes. LIMBAUGH: America is so oppressive, so mean to minorities. America doesn't deserve super power status. This is why I wanted Obama to fail. In his view, in the Alinsky view, in the American left's view, America is flawed, America is the problem in the world. America doesn't deserve-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: The apologies. LIMBAUGH: Right. HANNITY: But economically 13 million more Americans on food stamps, eight million more in poverty. LIMBAUGH: That's good. That mean more people voting Democrat, more people depending on government. They want that, Sean. HANNITY: We have 14 states, record low unemployment. We had lowest unemployment since '69. LIMBAUGH: Right. HANNITY: A million more jobs than people on unemployment. LIMBAUGH: Right. HANNITY: Look at who is benefiting. African-American unemployment, lowest ever. Hispanic unemployment, Asian unemployment, women in the workplace unemployment, all of these success, you are saying, stops if they get the House. LIMBAUGH: That's -- let me ask you a simple question. Why? You just -- you heard him just go through these statistics. The facts of the economic advancement. We've got more jobs than there are job openings. HANNITY: A million. LIMBAUGH: We got a million more jobs than there are openings. That hasn't happened since 2017. Who was president then? It wasn't Obama. The things you just heard, Sean go through, the Democrats are angry at all of it. Why are they happy? Folks, we are in a roaring economy. More people than ever can get the job they want, they are getting raises. There are being bonus. We have people free to start their own businesses. The economy in every other aspect of life in America is on the upswing, and a political party and its voters are mad about it. Why? Why couldn't you be happy? The answer is very simple. If it happens as a result of individual aptitude and application instead of government making it happen, they are going to oppose it. This the greatest threat, economic activity, economic growth, self-sufficiency, self- reliance, people learning that the old rules of working hard and applying yourself pay off, biggest threat to the American left in the Democrat Party that there could be. HANNITY: Let me ask you this. LIMBAUGH: Why aren't they happy about this? I mean, everybody ought to be- - (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Because they lose their power. LIMBAUGH: Of course. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Here's what I want to ask. LIMBAUGH: A question answers itself. HANNITY: You have been a leader in the conservative movement in America-- (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: I don't know. HANNITY: No. LIMBAUGH: I don't know. HANNITY: Number one-- (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: The conservative-- HANNITY: -- there's audience sustained and bigger. LIMBAUGH: The conservative movement is led by never-Trumpers. HANNITY: Well, look, OK. LIMBAUGH: In their minds-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: If they had their way, where would we be? No here. Hillary. LIMBAUGH: Hillary -- Hillary would be president if they had their way. HANNITY: So here's my question. You knew well in fact, if you believe Goldwater was a wave, if you believe Reagan was a wave -- meaning the advancement of conservativism. If you believe Newton the contract was a wave-- LIMBAUGH: Right. HANNITY: -- where does Donald Trump -- I look at his policies. I've always been a conservative. I never change my views. I say it differently, new circumstances, but my fundamental core beliefs have never changed. Nor have yours. All of these people have said he is not a conservative. Where? Besides trade, and I don't even think trade -- he never planned a trade war. LIMBAUGH: He is implementing. HANNITY: Yes. LIMBAUGH: Look, I know these people, I got to know them in 30 years going to-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: William Buckley loves you. LIMBAUGH: Buckley, well, I will tell you a story about him in a minute where he would be. I thought you are going to ask me where he would be on Trump. But the answer to that is pretty simple. But they don't like Trump because of his manners. They -- Trump is implementing issues that these people have devoted their lives to seeing passed, and they oppose it and they are running away from it. It must never have been about the issues. It must be about the proper manners and making sure we don't offend our liberal friends in Washington so forth and all of that. So Trump does all of that. I can't abide this, this is so offensive to me, I can't do this. dunk. And so, meanwhile-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: You're right. LIMBAUGH: -- everything that's happening is making America great, exactly as conservatives said it would, and they don't want to be on the bus. HANNITY: He -- I say, and I say to people and I said, what? He governs as strong a conservative as we've seen in our lifetime. LIMBAUGH: Yes, he does. But I don't think the divide in America is left and right so much. We're still there. HANNITY: Conservative principles. LIMBAUGH: Conservative principles it just-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Judges, tax cuts, regulation, border security. LIMBAUGH: Right. HANNITY: Peace through strength. LIMBAUGH: It's what kind of a country that the traditions of the founding are, are we going to go Marxist leftist? I mean, that's what this is about. We don't have in common with them, Sean. I hear all these people who still say we need to cross the aisle so that we can cooperate so that show the government -- what do we have in common? What, name something we have in common with any of the people acting to destroy Kavanaugh? Where is the middle ground to compromise with them on Kavanaugh. They didn't even want to deny him -- allow him due process. HANNITY: Zero. And no corroboration. LIMBAUGH: They wanted to destroy his life. And his family, his career, his past, his future, and they tell us, they are the party of compassion. HANNITY: We've seen before, we've senn that Bork, Clarence Thomas. LIMBAUGH: You see it every day. HANNITY: In every election year. LIMBAUGH: We see it every say. HANNITY: And now every day. LIMBAUGH: Donald Trump -- I'm sure you have taken your hits. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: I want to ask you about this. LIMBAUGH: You've taken your hits-- HANNITY: Yes. LIMBAUGH: We see it's everybody -- that anybody that they determine is an effective messenger of anything they disagree with, they are going to target. HANNITY: We could do 10 hours except, you have to start getting paid. Rush is going to hate a question I'm going to ask him in a few minutes. He's going to hate me and never let me back in the studio. So we'll get back to that. Much more with Rush right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Welcome back to Hannity. We are coming to you live from EIB Southern Command, that means Rush Limbaugh is our guest for the full hour. I never thought in my lifetime, my mother was a prison guard. My dad was a family court probation -- Irish family, Rush. You know, a lot of NYPD cops. LIMBAUGH: Right. HANNITY: Two guys were deity, FBI in my family. I never thought FBI top officials, the people we give the powerful tools of intelligence to, would turn, not only on the American people. Lies at be told, FISA court frauds would be taken, it exonerates somebody that we know was guilty. But then use those tools and her bought and paid for Russian information to destroy the president that should have lost, according to Peter Strzok, 100 million to zero. LIMBAUGH: Right. HANNITY: Did you ever think you'd see that? LIMBAUGH: Well, honestly, no, I have the same attitude about law enforcement in general. HANNITY: yes, you do. LIMBAUGH: I've gotten to know some top-tier FBI people over the course of my life. Who, themselves now are appalled by this. The scope of this -- you have described this perfectly, the scope of this, when you stop and think of what happened here. That the top tier of the Obama Department of Justice -- do not leave him out of this. And everybody there, all of these people, Strzok, and Lisa Page, and McCabe, Bruce Ohr, Comey, this was a concerted effort to deny Donald Trump the presidency. They had to get Hillary exonerated, first. That is why they looked in a way in the e-mail scandal and the server. They had to get her elected. That would save their jobs, save their careers, and we wouldn't know any of this that we know had she been elected. They got scared when they saw that Trump was not going to be defeated in a landslide. The very process of using government intelligence agencies -- this is nothing for people to have seen this, how anyone can vote for Democrats after seeing what has happened here, the one person that really meddled with the Russians, the one person that really colluded, the one person that really rigged an election, none other than Madame Hillary. HANNITY: What an irony. LIMBAUGH: I mean, it's stunning here. And Trump hasn't done zilch, and Mueller has been looking. He got no limits on money or scope, he has been looking for two years. Zero. HANNITY: It doesn't exist. But it did -- imagine this. She, first, there was no bigger obstruction case. If Rush Limbaugh had subpoenaed your computers and your e-mails, and you deleted them, you acid wash your hard drive with bleach bit, yet have somebody that works here for you busted up your devices with hammers. I promise you, you would have gone to jail. LIMBAUGH: Easily. HANNITY: Easily. Slam-dunk case of obstruction. Exoneration written to me- - (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: But far less than the dealing with the FBI, right. But they had to exonerate her, Sean. I mean, she was the Democrat nominee. She was the one guaranteeing their positions and their careers by virtue of her winning. They had to exonerate her. They could not on July 5th with Comey or in late October, they could not convict her or even charge her with anything. They did not want to affect the outcome of an election, while they are in the midst of literally doing that very thing. But it's stunning, Hillary Clinton cheats, Hillary Clinton, Glenn Simpson, Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie, Michael Steele or Christopher Steele, the whole thing is designed, opposition research, they create this document, and it is turned over as legitimate intelligence to the FISA court. They may have been on it, too. I haven't seen a lot of anger coming out of them. HANNITY: Great point. LIMBAUGH: And it is used to destroy Donald Trump and his campaign, then his transition, then his presidency much like they tried to destroy Kavanaugh. It cannot -- it cannot triumph. It simply cannot be allowed to triumph. HANNITY: If it's allowed we have a dual justice system. LIMBAUGH: We already do. HANNITY: We already do. LIMBAUGH: We got a two-tier justice system. HANNITY: It's like we have a one-tier tax system where, you know, the top 20 percent pretty much pay lower bill. Let me ask you about this Khashoggi. You saw Tom Friedman today. LIMBAUGH: Yes. Well, he made, Friedman made a good point about this. HANNITY: Yes. LIMBAUGH: And I got to acknowledge good points when they are made. I think this is precarious time for the Trump administration because the left is trying to use this Khashoggi death, tie it to Trump. They are trying to get Trump blame for everything. HANNITY: If he cured cancer, Rush, they would still be mad at him. LIMBAUGH: For destroying the livelihood of how many people in the medical field. HANNITY: They would find a reason. LIMBAUGH: The thing about Mohammed bin Salman, the thing he was doing that had everybody really exciting, the important thing he was doing, was supposedly reforming militant Islam. He was getting rid of the Wahhabi influence, which is where terrorist Islam comes from. The Saudi royal family is Islam. They are in charge of Mecca, and they determine what Islam is going to be. If it's going to be terrorist Islam, Wahhabi Islam the royal family Makes it happen. Well, Bin Salman is tired of being dependent on petrol dollars. He wants all this investment from Hollywood to tech. He wants to build a new city and, in the process, he's got to reform it. It looks like he let women drive, he's going to get rid of violent militant Islam and deemphasized Wahhabi. And now that's all good. The death is probably one of the most important things the Saudi royal family can do for the world, is to deemphasized the militant aspects of Islam. Then this Khashoggi things comes along, and it looks like there isn't any real reform. You criticize the state and they kill you, so forth. It's a -- I hope Trump and his team do it right on this because there are lay in and weight. If he goes-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: It's a trap. LIMBAUGH: - if he goes too far in what they think is exonerating he Saudis for oil deals or business deals or arms deals that are important to America. HANNITY: Can I -- didn't the Clintons take $25 million from the Saudis for their foundation? LIMBAUGH: Absolutely, it is a deal -- it's a two-way street. HANNITY: Where was the Benghazi outrage? (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: Exactly. HANNITY: Except for conservatives. LIMBAUGH: I asked that the other day. HANNITY: Yes. LIMBAUGH: Where's all the concern for four dead Americans in Benghazi? But I just want to tell you one thing here, folks, trying to tell you that there is recorded evidence of the murder and the dismemberment and the dispatchment of the body, because it was recorded on his Apple watch. Khashoggi's apple watch. I'm here to tell you, that is not technological possibly -- technologically possible. There are three ways a watch can transmit data. LTE, which is cellular, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. Apple has not activated LTE in Turkey. That's the longest range. The only way this guy had it to transmit data from his watch to his phone would be Bluetooth. His car, his wife south -- fiance, really, I don't think it's possible from them to be a recording of what happened. HANNITY: We got to take a break. The question you're going to hate, number one and you-- (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: I've never hated a question. I've rescinded some because they're stupid but I've-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Great. He's already accused my question to be stupid. (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: No. Drive by it is, stupid question. I didn't want stupid. HANNITY: It might be. But I think an important one, and your predictions for 19 days. LIMBAUGH: OK. HANNITY: More with Rush Limbaugh as we continue. His Southern Command EIB headquarters, Rush for the full hour. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: As we continue with Rush Limbaugh. So, the first question you are going to hate, I was here last time. LIMBAUGH: Yes. HANNITY: I try never to bug you -- you don't like TV. You love this -- it is a golden mic, we'll get a shot of it behind you. Your radio audience is bigger, more massive today than it's ever been because of all the options and ways people can look. LIMBAUGH: It is amazing too. That's true. HANNITY: It's crazy, right? LIMBAUGH: Yes. HANNITY: So, my question is, I said, Rush, do one hour a month on TV. Just you, in the studio, do one hour every other week. Do one every quarter. You think I am a pain in the ass, you can say it. LIMBAUGH: No, no, I'm flattered. I'm flattered. I just -- I've been there, I've done-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: One hour a month. LIMBAUGH: One hour. But look at, there is already a controversy. Something I said earlier has already been wiped. You will-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: It's wiped clean. LIMBAUGH: -- you will never know, folks, because it was not deemed appropriate. It was not profanity, it was not offensive, but it has been wiped. HANNITY: I will never hear the end of this now ever. HANNITY: No, it's good. HANNITY: They are going to want to know. (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: Outtakes will show up somewhere. HANNITY: No, they won't. No, they won't. LIMBAUGH: Somebody at Fox would, Sean. HANNITY: I've got it. It's happening. Here is my next thing. LIMBAUGH: Yes. HANNITY: I look at 19 days, I'm thinking, my gut, heart, mind, soul, I want to win. I'm not sick of winning. I hope, I think we are going to pick up some big seats in the Senate. Hoping on the House. Two far questions. Predictions, and what do you say to people that so respect what you have to say about this election in 19 days? LIMBAUGH: I still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine outcomes in some races that we don't know. So it's still very hard to predict. Kavanaugh feedback reaction was 100 percent positive for Republicans, the Democrats really blew that. But 435 of these things -- I don't know. I just rely on hope -- which is again, naive, I don't have survey data. I don't trust it. It hasn't been right consistently enough for me. And the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump gone. I don't know how they can take that out of their work. I don't believe in pure objectivity, so I distrust. HANNITY: If I put you on the spot with predictions. LIMBAUGH: We hold the House and we increase the Senate. And because I think that's justice. I think that's justice. I think the Democrat Party deserves to lose in the single biggest electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: And you-- LIMBAUGH: -- because of the actions they've taken just in the last month. HANNITY: Prove enough. And you'll think about maybe an hour a quarter? LIMBAUGH: I've never stop thinking about it. I'll think about it. HANNITY: You'll think about it. LIMBAUGH: Can do it right here? HANNITY: Right here. LIMBAUGH: Right here. HANNITY: Great to see you, thank you so much. Rush Limbaugh. All right. We'll wrap things up from Russia's studio when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left this evening and I want to thank a lot of people, they have a great crew here -- Rush Limbaugh, his crew for giving us the time to do the full hour tonight. Don't forget set your DVR, don't miss an episode. We're always fair and balanced, we're not the destroy-Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. Stay tuned. Laura Ingraham takes it away. She's in the swamp, the sewer D.C. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.\n\u00a0Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

            "article_content": "Fox & Friends with Carly Shimkus. Google, owned by the same parent company as YouTube, is arguably the most influential social media company in the world, with a power to affect the public dialogue across the globe in ways unimaginable just a handful of years ago. The question is now being asked: Is Google flexing its muscles to do just that? Conservatives have pointed to mounting evidence that Google is waging war on them. They\u2019ll cite everything from YouTube banishing conservatives for espousing their beliefs, to Google partnering with left-wing organizations to disparage conservative thought itself. All along, Google has issued bizarre, barely understandable statements denying these charges. Now Google executives have been caught again \u2013 twice in the past two weeks. Actually, they have indicted themselves with explosive leaks of their own material. And it goes to the very top of the corporate food chain. Breitbart has released an explosive video of an hour-long post-election Google meeting featuring staff and top executives discussing their despair over the election of President Trump in 2016. There\u2019s a reason the video has a \u201cConfidential \u2013 Internal Use Only\u201d label on top. It\u2019s about the last thing that company wanted the public to see. The video features Google co-founder Sergey Brin opening the meeting by declaring: \u201cI think it\u2019s a very stressful time. It conflicts with many of our values \u2026 voting is not a rational act.\u201d In one fell swoop he both endorsed Hillary Clinton and disparaged the Trump voters who Clinton referred to as \u201cdeplorables.\u201d The video features Google Vice President for Global Affairs Kent Walker dismissing the election results as \u201ca hiccup\u201d interrupting the march of the left. Walker says: \u201cWhat are the next steps for us before the world comes into this environment of tribalism that\u2019s self-destructive (in) the long term? \u2026 History is on our side in a profound and important way \u2026 the moral arc of history is long but bends toward progress.\u201d The video features a visibly distraught Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat attempting to rally the troops. Porat says: \u201cWe have an obligation to fight for what is right. And that is one of the many things that makes this company so beautiful. \u2026 Our values are strong! We will fight to protect them, and we will use our great strength and resources that we have to continue to advance really important values.\u201d As executives on stage declare a commitment to a leftist ideology, you hear the staff in the audience cheer. As staffers declare their leftist militancy, you watch the executives applaud. Google has responded with yet another \u201cWhat? Us?\u201d denial. Among other preposterous statements, it says: \u201cNothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products.\u201d Recently Tucker Carlson of Fox News broke another Google story, this time an internal confidential memo from a Google executive to her superiors describing how the company tried to boost the Latino vote for Hillary Clinton. The executive calls this a \u201csilent donation\u201d to the cause. She expresses special gratitude for the \u201cshout out\u201d she received for her efforts from Google CEO Sundar Pichai \u2013 the same man who was a no-show after promising to testify before Congress to discuss the company\u2019s political agenda. The evidence against Google is overwhelming. Some more examples: So let\u2019s review Google\u2019s statements. What Google is saying publicly: \u201cNo personal bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products.\u201d What Google is saying privately: \u201cWe have an obligation to fight for what is right \u2026 to use our great strength and resources that we have \u2026 to advance our values.\u201d This must stop. Google is too strong, too secretive and too disingenuous. Google's CEO didn't show up for the last congressional hearing. It\u2019s time for congressional subpoenas.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Justice with Judge Jeanine,\" October 20, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JEANINE PIRRO, HOST: Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us, and thanks again for making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for keeping \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals\" on the New York Times bestsellers list for three months and counting. Have you gotten you copy yet? A very special show on deck for tonight. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway is here live. Katrina Pierson from the Trump reelection campaign, and later the host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" Tucker Carlson himself. Also on deck, an exclusive tour of Liberty University with the President of the groundbreaking college, Jerry Falwell, Jr. a tour you won't want to miss. But first my Opening Statement. The military needs to be deployed to our southern border immediately to stop the caravan of thousands of illegals pouring into our nation. Right now is a very dangerous time for Americans. Border control is essential to your safety and the safety of your family. The military, the National Guard, ICE, Border Patrol and DHS needs to block this caravan from entering our nation. Now, I'm not saying they are all criminals. What I am asking is, who are they? What I am saying is I want to vet them, screen them. I want to find out who among them is a criminal, who among them is a gang member like the notorious MS-13 gang members who arrogantly rode into our United States by invitation during the Obama years and they are in New York and elsewhere brutally and savagely murdering innocent American citizens. I want to know who is a pedophile? Who is a sex offender? Who thinks they are entitled to beat hair wives? I want to know who has an alcohol problem? Who has a drug problem? Who likes a drive drunk and who has no problem hauling drugs for the cartel? And if you can prove that you're not one of them or any other kind of criminal, I want to know what you have to offer us. What do you bring to this great nation? What are you going contribute? Why should we be proud to count you as an American other than adding to the democrats voting block and continuing the mob mentality that you already exhibited you are proficient at? Now, if you are not a criminal, I want you to get to the back of the line behind everyone else who waited for a visa, came here legally, hired a lawyer, learned American history and swore allegiance to this great nation, and only then am I interested in even talking to you about entering. I for one am sick and tired of the sense of entitlement that illegals have to enter this country and then immediately claim their constitutional rights as they carry the flags not of America, but the flags of their country, and God forbid we try to deport them to the country whose flag they so proudly wave. They have no claim on this country. They are not entitled to be here. They break our laws to come here. Now, this is not a left or right issue. This is a security issue. A safety issue. We simply cannot have people about whom we know nothing living next door to us, working next to us or driving next to us. Crossers claim they are running from violence in their home countries. I spent my career fighting on behalf of innocent helpless, silent victims of crimes, victimized by violence, criminals who should have been stopped long before the crime. You are telling me -- you're telling me because they are being victimized that every one of them is a victim and therefore entitled to come here as opposed to anywhere else on the planet? Go to the UN. Stay in Mexico. Now, they say their poverty is justification for illegal entry. I have got news for you, millions are suffering from poverty all over the world -- Haiti, Uganda, Zimbabwe, the Congo, third world countries -- so why is it just central Americans and Mexicans are the poverty stricken ones pouring into this country by the millions? Why? Why? Because they can. Because no one has told them they can't. Because no one has stopped them. They come because there is a big prize at the end -- education, medication, housing, food stamps -- all the things you pay for. So you want open borders. Look at what it's done to Europe. If the left, the mob, and the demon rats have their way, there would be rogue cities and rogue zones all over the US just like Europe with crime-ridden zones where law abiding citizens and law enforcement are afraid to enter, and for good reason. The left then, the Democrats in this country add an additional layer of protection so illegal criminals cannot be arrested in sanctuary cities and states where American citizens are thus put at risk. These people don't want a border wall. Have you ever asked yourself why? Do you think they have a philosophical or an ideological objection to the concept of a wall or protection? Of course not. All these bozos are protected by doors and fences and security. Yet they want our borders open. They want illegals to cross as a mob and act like a mob and unite around a state they have no right to be in and register and vote Democrat. Many bring poison, drugs that take the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. A primer, 90 percent of heroin use in this country comes through the southern border and Mexico thumbs its nose at us and says, \"Your people ask for it.\" I have got an idea. It's time to play hardball. The foreign aid to those countries -- Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - - some $464 million in foreign aid from us -- end it. Congress needs to stop the flow of our money to them and if they need it so badly, use to it take care of the poverty and the victimization in their country and I am sick and tired of people telling to us have a heart. We have a heart. We are the most generous country in the world. In 1986, Ronald Reagan gave all illegals amnesty, but amnesty does nothing but create an incentive for additional crossings by illegals so, here we are again. And for all of you who want to trash President Trump, I have got even more news for you. Presidents Bush and Obama sent the military to the border to the tune of $1.3 billion and it's time to do it again. So let me be clear, when you cross the border into these United States illegally, expect to be arrested. You do not have the right to come here. We did not invite you here. You cannot stay here and on your way out, you can tell the Democrats, George Soros and the angry mob that's coming here, you either come the right way like everyone else or be ready to face the military and a one-way ticket back to where you came from. That's my open. Don't forget my book, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" It's been now on the New York Times bestsellers list for three months and counting. And believe it, it's got to be killing them at the New York Times. And President Trump tackled the issue of immigration and the caravan in Guatemala while taking on the Democrats at a raucous rally in Nevada today. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The Democratic Party and it is openly inviting millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders and overwhelm our nation. The democrats want caravans. They like the caravans. A lot of people say, \"I wonder who started that caravan?\" And I want to thank Mexico. Mexico has been so incredible. Thank you, Mexico and the leaders of Mexico. Thank you. And you know why? Because now, Mexico respected the leadership of the United States. They have respect now. They now respect our leaders. Thank you, Mexico. Great. We appreciate it. We do. But what they want is -- by the way, the wall, the people are screaming, so we started the wall, it's moving along. I want to build it rapidly, I can do it in a year, we did $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion. We have another $1.6 billion, it sounds like a lot of money, when you're going for almost a thousand miles, it's not that much, but the wall is moving. I want to do it in one year. I want them to approve the wall. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: And joining me now with more on this developing story and some other topics making news, counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway. Kellyanne, thanks for being here today. You know, it's interesting, the President just then suggested that there might be more behind this and this sudden caravan right before the midterms. I must tell you, it seems to have happened all of a sudden. I mean, I haven't heard about a caravan since Obama invited them in 2014 and 2015. What do you think is the genesis of this sudden movement toward the US border? KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, Judge, whatever the genesis, it's so great that the cameras and klieg lights are on because I'm always a fan of just showing America what is really happening, not just what is being carried through some of the reports and cherry picked through some of the reports, but just shine the light, bring the cameras. And now people can see what it really means. Before they saw what they called the kid in cages which of course turned out many of them to be President Obama's kids in cages. But let them see what's happening and let them juxtapose that with a President who is saying in light of the modernized revolutionary trade deal, the USMCA -- Mexican-Canadian-American trade deal that we have better relationships with Mexico now. They respect this President and Commander-in-Chief and they are helping now. PIRRO: Kellyanne, if they respect this President and Commander-in-Chief, and I believe you, I believe the President, I should be comfortable believing that Mexico is going to stop them before they come to the United States. CONWAY: Well, they ought to do that because I'll tell you, if you look statistically, Jeanine, and I want everyone to know that until very recently, the predominant trafficker, the predominant person coming over the border was a single male -- one male person coming in from Mexico. Now 45 percent or so are family units coming in, unaccompanied minors or people who say they are a family coming in from Central America. This is a problem because we are encouraging people to smuggle children over and pretend they are a family unit. There is no way for us to know instantly at the border, and by the way, and I've talked to a number of Cabinet secretaries and other senior officials this week. Don't forget, our brave men and women at the border are doing the best that they can and they risk their lives every single day to be there and ask legitimate questions. If you want to come to one of the 26 ports of entry, if you want to stand in line and immigrate into the world's most generous country to immigrants, you can do that. We are talking about the sexual assaults are up now, the child smuggling is up, the drug smuggling is up. And all of these because we don't have -- we are a sovereign nation without physical borders and this President ... (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: Kellyanne, I want to talk about statistics as it relates to the heroin crossing the border. How our southern borders are used by the cartel as a point of entry, the poison that is killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, a thousand a week, minimum. CONWAY: That's right. There is no doubt. This president has had as a major focus stopping the drug supply and drug demand crisis that is ruining this nation; 72,000 Americans dead last year, 90 percent or so of all heroin in this country comes through the southern border. Obviously, the cocaine comes through the southern border and now, increasingly, the fentanyl that is manufactured in labs in China, we are told is also coming through the southern border because everybody knows it's an easy way to get in. And so, this is very problematic because this President -- and many people don't focus on this, he's constantly talking about the poison coming over the southern border that coming to your community. And this opioid and drug crisis is no longer somebody else's kid or somebody else's coworker, somebody else's community. It's touching every nook and cranny in this country. PIRRO: It's real now. Well, there is no question about that. I want to move to something that's in the news right now and that is the Khashoggi -- the President seems to have indicated that he believes that the explanation for Khashoggi's death given by the Saudis, but there seems to be evidence of his being tortured and chokehold, that it wasn't just a fight, it was a planned execution with bone saws et cetera. CONWAY: I have no information to verify any of that. I am going to stand by the comments that the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo and the President have made that these investigations are ongoing. The president has made clear that there seems no other explanation other than that the gentleman is dead and I can't get ahead of the completion of any other investigation. It's very disappointing to see a major network run a completely false report that our own Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo and our President said was completely false and fantastical that somehow, the Secretary of State heard an audio tape and/or read a transcript from said audiotape. They went with a false report and it's that kind of reporting that really hurts investigations and the conclusion of information, but I'm not going to get ahead of that. PIRRO: Okay, all right, and it's that kind of false reporting that Americans believe is going on, which is why they elected the outsider President. CONWAY: Well, I think it's why -- look, that's right. And that's also why the media has a 20 percent approval rating. Look, the President has said if in fact this happened, then there could be severe consequences. The Vice President reiterated that. PIRRO: Of course. Kellyanne Conway, thanks so much for being with us tonight. CONWAY: Thanks, Jeanine. PIRRO: All right, Katrina Pierson making a surprise appearance on \"Justice\" to take on Chris Hahn. That's ahead, and you don't want to miss it. And next, she's back. Hillary Clinton's name comes up in Federal court as new details emerge in a myriad of scandals, dating back to her time as Secretary of State. Here to talk about that as well as whether the Mueller investigation will be mercifully brought to an end is Tom Fitton from Judicial Watch. \"Justice\" rolls on in a moment. Welcome back. New details out of Federal court this week about the scandals that are still dogging Hillary Clinton. Here to talk about that as well as reports that the Mueller investigation may be close to an end date is the President of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton. All right, good evening, Tom. TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH: Good evening. PIRRO: You know, it's very interesting to read about this Federal judge. His name is Royce Lamberth and he was pretty outraged that the -- not just how they granted immunity to the Hillary people in that e-mail investigation, but for providing false statements on the Clinton e-mail case. Now, several -- two years ago I said all of these state department lawyers should be brought up on contempt or fraud before the court. What do you think should happen? FITTON: Well, at least they should be required to ask more questions and they should stop obstructing our request for information. You know, the Federal court judge already granted us discovery because he had been yanked. He thought there was bad faith in the way, obviously, the State Department had behaved in the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit about Benghazi, no less. And of course, they are hiding their Clinton e-mails from us. They didn't tell the court or Judicial Watch forthrightly about what was going on and that's why they court -- they came in not too long ago and said, \"Look, I had false statements given to me. I don't know about these false affidavits that were given to me. I am interested to know what the Justice Department knew what and when.\" And I'm surprised that Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton's top aid was given immunity when I found that she committed perjury and I couldn't believe her in another case about e-mails that Judicial Watch had pursued. So the State Department is fighting us on this, which is most troubling. PIRRO: Well, yes, and the State Department as well as the Department of Justice said at the beginning of the Trump administration that Hillary Clinton was a private citizen and therefore, her records shouldn't be available to the public as freedom of information. I mean, this deep state is so deep I don't even know where it stops or starts. But having said all of that, doesn't a judge have the right to hold these lawyers in contempt? FITTON: Well, you see, that's potentially the relief that may be granted over after we get some of the questions we still have pending with the State Department. We are asking for instance this judge to allow us to depose Hillary Clinton directly, ask her questions directly about her e- mail practices and he's considering it still. Cheryl Mills also and all other top aide. PIRRO: What's the likelihood that that's going to happen, Tom? FITTON: I think it's a significant likelihood. We've already questioned her under oath in written questions. We're fighting her in another court about getting more questions answered, so discovery for Hillary Clinton is a real possibility. PIRRO: All right, I want to move on to something else. You said that it's time to bring Mueller in to testify before Congress. You're talking about oversight, in their oversight capacity or the judiciary? Who? FITTON: Well, you could have the oversight committee, you could have the judiciary committees of both the Senate and the House. Question them about the administration of his investigation, the circumstances of his hiring. We have Rosenstein. PIRRO: So what's it going to take? Have you spoken to any Congress people about this, Tom? FITTON: Oh no, they don't want to do this. PIRRO: Why? FITTON: They don't want to do this. PIRRO: Why? FITTON: I have been struck by the fact that Mueller has been exempted from oversight. The only government official in the Trump administration who they don't want to talk to. Look at all the folks they want to bring in as witnesses -- McCabe, Strzok, Rosenstein -- but they don't want to talk to the guy who seems to be running the Justice Department on the Russia investigations, Bob Mueller. PIRRO: Right and looking the other way when he finds out that there is criminal activity on the left, it's outrageous. Well, maybe the deep state goes into Congress, too. Who knows. FITTON: That's right. It's well represented in Congress. There is a deep state caucus there, believe you and me. PIRRO: Sad commentary. Tom Fitton, thanks so much. FITTON: You're welcome. PIRRO: All right, still ahead tonight, I take you on an exclusive to Liberty University in Virginia for a tour given by none other than the ground breaking school's President, Jerry Falwell, Jr. And next, the marquee matchup for the night, Katrina Pierson, Chris Hahn -- the political panel -- chopping at the bit to debate the week in Washington. Don't go away. Back in a moment. ANITA VOGEL, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Anita Vogel. A police officer shot and killed in Georgia today and the suspects are still at large. Officer Antwan Tony of the Gwinnett County Police Department was shot around 3:00 p.m. He was responding to reports of a suspicious vehicle at a middle school near Snellville, Georgia. Tony, a two-year veteran of the force later died at the hospital. Witnesses say as many as four suspects fled the scene. And with no winner in last night's Mega Millions Lottery drawing, the jackpot grows to a record breaking $1.6 billion. This is the largest the massive jackpot in history just barely edging out the previous record set in January of 2016. The massive jackpot, bringing many first-time players to the lottery. The odds of winning are about one in 302 million. I'm Anita Vogel. Now let's take back to \"Justice With Judge Jeanine.\" PIRRO: As you can see, chaos at the Guatemala-Mexico border and immigration taking center stage in the national debate again just in time of the midterm elections, just one of the topics we talk about with the panel. Syndicated radio show host, Chris Hahn making a special appearance on \"Justice\" tonight, senior adviser to Trump 2020 reelection, Katrina Pierson. All right, guys, you are familiar with the mob of illegal immigrants, illegal aliens pushing through from Guatemala to Mexico against police enforcement and what we saw in those few seconds were virtually all men. Tell me, Chris, why these people should be allowed to enter in a mob of thousands into the United States. CHRIS HAHN, SYNDICATED RADIO SHOW HOST: Look, I am for controlled borders as are most of people on the left in this country. I think that the President had an opportunity last year when Schumer and Pelosi offered him DACA for the wall and then he was talked out of it by McConnell and Ryan because they wanted this exact issue for this exact moment. They are more concerned about the election than solving the actual problem. They would have gotten more border security, they would have gotten the wall. PIRRO: Okay, so your answer to these -- listen, Chris, your answer to this illegals crossing and violently crossing, resisting law enforcement, all men is because they are concerned about the Trump-Schumer -Mitch McConnell fight? HAHN: No, no, no. I am saying that the reason why ... PIRRO: So do they have the right to be here? HAHN: Of course not, unless they are seeking asylum legitimately or there is a reason for them to be here and everybody agrees with that. They need to come here legally and there needs to be a process. And there was goodwill by both the President, Leader Pelosi and Leader Schumer but Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan bluffed lost it. PIRRO: I don't want to talk politics. I don't want to talk politics tonight, Chris. I want to talk about this mob. HAHN: Okay. PIRRO: Go ahead, Katrina. KATRINA PIERSON, SENIOR ADVISER TO TRUMP 2020 REELECTION: Look, Judge, it was President Trump who nearly doubled the recipients he was willing to accept over Obama, but that's neither here nor there. This really isn't just any mob. This is a column on the march carrying their own flag. This is an invasion. And I have to applaud the Mexican government for at least appearing to want to help with this situation, but let's not pretend this is organic. We are talking about men, thousands of men, only scattered with women and children for protection who are actually marching across the border. This another leftist-funded operation, fully flagged with several innocent victims, photo ready outrage designed to pull on the heart strings of Americans, complete emotional attachment only to distract from the rational analysis behind this. This is no more organic than Dr. Ford coming out on the 25th hour to try and have the left capitalize on getting rid of due process for our country. (CROSSTALK) HAHN: Katrina ... PIRRO: Go ahead, Chris. Why don't you answer ... HAHN: Katrina, if you want to talk about -- if you want to go down to the conspiracy theory hole about this, there is no way that Democrats in this country would have organized this at this point and in the midterm election. This is perfectly pitched for the Republican base right now. This is exactly what you needed at this time to energize your base. PIRRO: So who organized ... PIERSON: So you are going to tell me, Chris that people who are oppressed ... HAHN: Well, no, what Katrina is suggesting that this is something that this is some conspiracy, I want to know what you know about the conspiracy, Katrina? PIERSON: ... and in poverty, they are in poverty, it costs $7,000.00 per head to bring these people, $7,000.00 per head to have these traffickers move this people throughout the southern hemisphere. HAHN: Yes. PIERSON: That is $35 million. HAHN: Well, Katrina, you're talking about a conspiracy ... PIERSON: How can impoverished people do this? HAHN: ... you are talking about a conspiracy from basically what you said was Democrats organized this in Guatemala. PIRRO: Somebody organized it. HAHN: You are so far lost on this ... (CROSSTALK) PIERSON: These American democrat leftists. PIRRO: All right, let me ask you this, Chris ... HAHN: Got it, got. PIRRO: ... should they be stopped by the military at the border and turned around? And that whole mob that unfortunately, the mob thing seems to be a favorite of the left. Shouldn't they be turned around immediately? I don't even -- look at them, they are all men. All men. They just decided at some point they want to come to the United States all of a sudden as opposed to last month, the month before and the month before? HAHN: I think all Americans believe in a secure border and I think there needs to be order at that border and I think the President was offered order at the border by Democrats and he rejected it because he wanted ... PIRRO: Don't make this about Donald Trump ... HAHN: Because the Republicans wanted this issue at this time. PIRRO: This is not about Donald Trump. He offered 1.8 million dreamers citizenship. HAHN: Well, I believe ... PIRRO: Cut the crap, Chris ... HAHN: ... in order at the border and I will tell you there has been less order at the border under this President than there was before ... PIRRO: Go ahead, Katrina, go ahead. PIERSON: All Americans clearly are not in support of secure borders because we have a Democratic Party in the United States that supports sanctuary cities. You can't have a secure border and sanctuary cities. That's kind of not how it works, Chris. We have to resolve the issue that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer ... (CROSSTALK) HAHN: There's no such thing as sanctuary cities ... PIERSON: ... and a perfect opportunity to resolve this ... PIRRO: What does mean, Chris? HAHN: What there is, is people -- what there is different times when people ask for documentation, what Katrina would have you do is for at least to ... PIRRO: Are you out of your mind, Chris? Don't you dare say on this channel that there is no such thing as sanctuary cities. Chris, stop talking. HAHN: ... if that's what you want, Katrina. PIRRO: You are not going to come here and spin lies. There are sanctuary cities, counties and states in the country ... HAHN: That's not a lie. PIRRO: ... where illegal criminals are provided more protection than American citizens. And don't you come on this show and say that that's not the case. HAHN: No, it's ... (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: That's it. Goodbye. PIERSON: Any American that runs into the law is asked for identification. These people, not so much. That is sanctuary, Chris. PIRRO: Thanks, guys. HAHN: Thank you. PIRRO: Bye. Jerry Falwell, Jr. and Tucker Carlson still on deck. Don't miss it. You know him as the host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" and this week, I sat down with Tucker to talk about his new book, my mother's favorite, \"Ship of Fools.\" Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) All right, Tucker Carlson, congratulations on the book. TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS: Thank you. PIRRO: I would buy it if only for the cover. You have Republicans and Democrats, some possibly lunatics, some people who should be in jail who aren't in jail, some people are headed for jail. Let me ask you this, do you expect any of these people in \"Ship of Fools\" to come on your show if you were to ask them? CARLSON: Well one of them has already refused, but no, I don't and actually, I know a lot of those people. I know almost all of them having been in DC my whole my life. It's not a personal attack. I mean, it's pretty easy to attack people personally. PIRRO: No, you called them fools, of course, it's a personal attack ... CARLSON: Well, I'm attacking their decisions and I'm attacking more than that ... PIRRO: Then you should put their decisions at their face ... CARLSON: No, but that's -- look, the whole interior of the book between the cover and the back cover is an explanation that it's not -- I know it's very fashionable to attack people's behavior in high school now, but I actually don't believe in that. I think you should assess people's adult decisions. PIRRO: Why are you covering up for what you did in high school? CARLSON: Yes, I am. I am, not that it remember any of it. I have no calendar, but let me just say, it's not that people make mistakes. I've made a million -- I worked at MSNBC, okay, so I've made mistakes. The question is, do you admit it and do you learn from it? And what I am so struck by, the reason Trump got elected is because the people made a series of terrible decisions about our economy, our foreign policy, our culture -- never admitted it and never learned. PIRRO: Okay, but I agree with you. Donald Trump is the President because Barack Obama was the guy before. CARLSON: Exactly. PIRRO: And people are fed up. They said, no more. But what I want to talk about is you say that we are headed towards, or at least the brink of a revolution. CARLSON: Yes. PIRRO: I agree with you. I think we're at the point where the liberals are proud and they consider it a badge of honor, when they obstruct, when they get in our faces, when they harass and you know, just harass us. CARLSON: I completely agree, but what's driving all of this volatility? It is not -- everybody wants to make everything a race question. Oh, it's this tribe against this tribe. I don't believe that. I think that our core problems are economic problems. The middle class was the majority for a hundred years; now it's the minority. People are getting poorer outside of the big cities and the big cities don't care. Young people are getting poorer, they can't get married, buy cars, buy houses. People know their kids will make less and be less successful and have less opportunity than they do. PIRRO: And whose fault is that and to whom should that -- the fact that that happened benefit? CARLSON: The people I write about are the answer to the question you just asked, a small group of people is way richer. and I live among them. I'm by the way richer than I was 10 years ago after the financial crash. PIRRO: Right. CARLSON: But the rest of the country is not. And if you are running the country, it's major institutions including its big banks and its big companies like Amazon, including its cultural institutions like NBC, you need to pay attention to what's happening to the people in your country. If you want to lead, you need to care about the people you are leading, and they don't. That's the truth. PIRRO: So in the end, which is the party that is going to help get us through this attempted socialism because you know they are winning around the country. They're getting elected. Bernie Sanders was an avowed socialist. He almost ran for President but for the rigged DNC and Hillary Clinton. CARLSON: He got 43 percent, he might have won. And a lot of people who voted for Bernie in the primaries voted for Trump because both of them were talking about not about race and gender and all of this boring college garbage, they're talking about core economic things, like -- by the way, what are wages doing? Our immigration policy hurts working class people, there's no debate about that and you never hear it. It's all about race. PIRRO: All right, and everybody loves you because you tell it straight. I love you. I watch your opening statements, what do you call them? I call them opens, what do you call them? CARLSON: Just the script. PIRRO: Just a script. Okay ... CARLSON: I'm very literal. PIRRO: Listen, what I love is, Kopechne. You talk about Mary Jo Kopechne and you say divers estimated she had survived for several hours in the Oldsmobile having an air pocket until she finally suffocated from lack of oxygen. But then, you go right to your point, which is, it doesn't matter. The feminist still loved Ted Kennedy. CARLSON: Well, that's the point. And by the way, I just want to be really clear, I believe in forgiveness. I'm the last person who does. If Ted Kennedy had said, \"You know I did that, it was cowardly. I was drunk. I didn't want to get arrested for it. I made a horrible decision and a woman died, and I'm sorry.\" I would be the first person to say, \"I believe in that.\" I'd be friends with Idi Amin if he repented. I don't believe in this no forgiveness thing that we're now all into. PIRRO: Yes, but here's the thing ... CARLSON: He never apologized. He lied about it. PIRRO: He didn't apologize and he got away with a homicide. It's called criminally negligent homicide. CARLSON: And he was a hero to the feminist. The man who killed a woman ... PIRRO: Right. CARLSON: And lied about it is a feminist hero. What does that tell you about their priorities? PIRRO: That's why I'm asking you. CARLSON: Women are not their priorities, obviously, why would you make a guy who killed a woman your hero? If you're a feminist. What does it mean? PIRRO: Okay, I have to go. It's the end of the segment. CARLSON: Well, it's so nice to see you. PIRRO: I want thank you for being on \"Justice.\" CARLSON: Thank you for having me. It was just. (END VIDEO TAPE) PIRRO: Next, a special treat, a firsthand look at Liberty University and a guided tour from its President, Jerry Falwell, Jr. Next. Liberty University is a one of a kind school in Lynchburg, Virginia. It is a non-profit Christian university where students and faculty practice what they preach. I had the pleasure to visit recently and got a first-hand tour from its President, Jerry Falwell, Jr. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) PIRRO: Here I am at Liberty University with the President of the University, Jerry Falwell -- how is it that this university in particular is able to get so many students who are so Christian oriented, Constitution oriented, who believe in this country and are so energized by what's going on today? JERRY FALWELL, JR. PRESIDENT, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY: Well, I call Liberty the Fox News Network of the academic world. Liberty is different than other universities in so many ways. The \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" did a cover story a few years ago. It said that the success of Liberty University is rooted in the fact that Liberty doesn't try to be like every other university. We try to emphasize academic freedom and freedom of expression. We try to keep education affordable and accessible. PIRRO: Let's walk a little bit. What is this right here that- this tower that's in front. FALWELL: The tower is the school of divinity. It's 275 feet high which is nearly 28 stories. There is a classroom on every floor. Under the lawn right there ... PIRRO: Under the lawn ... FALWELL: There are three basketball courts where the basketball team practices. Those are the newer dorms up there on the hill. A lot of new construction going on still. PIRRO: Let's talk about the young kids here, the students here. Who are they -- they are so different from their cohorts in universities? FALWELL: Visitors to the campus are always telling me how they go out of their way to ask them if they need directions. They drop something, the students will pick it up for them. A lot of universities, you walk around campus and the student won't make eye contact with you. PIRRO: Right. What's the role -- let's get a little more political. I mean, with the midterms coming up. What's the role of the evangelical Christian, having seen everything that we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings and what role do they play and can they turn elections in this country? FALWELL: Well, when President Trump said to African-Americans, what the hell do you have to lose? We took that as he was talking to evangelicals as well because establishment Republicans have betrayed us for decades, and so a lot of us voted for Trump because what do have to lose? PIRRO: Do you think though that after the Kavanaugh hearings and the sharp divide in this country that's going to bring out the evangelicals? FARWELL: Absolutely. I think they are angry about how he was treated and I've heard that from a lot just the last couple of days and I just -- I think that anger is going to backfire on the Democrats. PIRRO: This is Virginia Rose and she is going ... FARWELL: This is my only grandbaby. She is seven months old. I've got one more on the way, but this is the only one we have so far. PIRRO: And she'll be a student here? FARWELL: It will be up to her, but ... PIRRO: With the midterms coming up, do you think those on the left are not just out of control, but they are interested in something different than the students here? FARWELL: I just think the country has never been more polarized. I remember when I was in law school in the '80s, I would travel with my father when he spoke at different mainstream universities, liberal schools, they would boo because he was a conservative, but they weren't like they are now. Now, in those days, liberals would say, \"I may not agree with you, but I'll fight for your right to say it.\" Now, they don't want you to say it. They become fascists instead of liberals, in my opinion. PIRRO: So what has happened to the country? FARWELL: You know, I think it's years and years of education in the public schools that are controlled by the Teachers Unions and then higher education that is just all the professors believe a certain way, I forget how many, 98 percent supported Obama at the Ivy league schools, and it's just -- they've just been indoctrinated young people. PIRRO: What can Liberty do to change that. FARWELL: That's why we exist and it's why we prospered is because it's an alternative to that indoctrination and that lack of academic freedom, lack of free expression. Conservatives are bullying and most mainstream universities. PIRRO: Yes, I know. (END VIDEO TAPE) PIRRO: And you are about to hear from the students at Liberty. \"Street Justice\" is next. You have heard from the President of the school, now hear from the students. I hit the campus of Liberty University for this week's \"street justice.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: Here I am at the campus of Liberty University and as you could see, many of these students are so bright because they are holding up my book, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals.\" I'm going to go around and ask them how much religion affects their politics and how much they love Liberty University? So what a shock. Here I am at Liberty. I just found someone who has my book. Okay, let's talk about politics and religion. Where does politics - - how is politics affected by your religion? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My politics are affected by may religion because God drives everything that I do. I'm actually prelaw major. You actually really have inspired me to pick my field ... PIRRO: Yes, you want to be a prosecutor? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I would. PIRRO: Mr. Six Five, do you play basketball? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did in high school. I'm doing a mural here though. PIRRO: What do you want to be? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Anything, you know, I am not totally sure yet. I'm a digital media major, maybe a broadcaster going along those lines. PIRRO: Yes, well, if you're going to be a broadcaster, you've got to get a taller cameraman. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am. PIRRO: Sorry, Greg. All right, how does religion affect your politics? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, as a Christian, I always like to vote more conservative and always put Jesus at my forefront in that regard. PIRRO: Wait a minute. Vote more conservative? Does that mean conservatives are more religious than the liberals? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel like they are more of a Christian fan base. PIRRO: Do you think the people on the right fight the way they should? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People on the right ... PIRRO: Yes, in other words, are people on the right to wimpy? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think so since Donald Trump is in office. I mean, Donald Trump has been at the forefront of that. I mean, look at him, he's tweeting up a storm. PIRRO: Yes, you're a smart guy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So religion affects my politics for sure, but it affects everything else, too. I'm actually registered Democrat and so it's a lot different for me where everybody else is a lot more conservative. PIRRO: But your Democrat friends, are they as tolerant as you are? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, they are not and I think ... PIRRO: Well, what does that tell you? Why are you still a Democrat? With a show of hands, how many of you are going to vote Republican in the midterms? Okay, now put them down. How many of you are going to vote Democrats in the midterms? Are you not voting at all? I've been watching you. How many of you love the school is much as I do? You know what folks? That says a lot. Thank you, God bless you all. (END VIDEO TAPE) PIRRO: Finally, tonight it's been three months and counting and my book, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals,\" is still sitting pretty on the New York Times bestsellers list. So you better go and get your copy before you're the last person you know who doesn't have one. And, tune into \"Wise Guys\" tomorrow night right here on Fox News at 8 p.m. Eastern where I will be a guest. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice, and the American way. \"The Greg Gutfeld Show\" is coming up next. See you next Saturday night, same place, same time, same me.

JESSE WATTERS, HOST:\u00a0 Welcome to. \"Watters' World.\"\u00a0 I'm Jesse Watters.\u00a0 President Trump speaking at a rally in Richmond, Kentucky. Let's listen in. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\u00a0\u00a0 ... that goes along the river with lots of people, many people were killed.\u00a0 Nobody ever talks about the people who were horribly injured.\u00a0 They lost legs.\u00a0 They lost arms.\u00a0 These were people that were running.\u00a0 They want to keep themselves in shape.\u00a0 They were working out.\u00a0 They were walking hand in hand together. They are dead.\u00a0 They are horribly wounded.\u00a0 Many will never ever recover.\u00a0 And what happened?\u00a0 What happened to him? It will be years of litigation.\u00a0 He came in, and then he took chain migration and he brought his mother and his father and his brother and his sister, and his aunt and his grandfather.\u00a0 None of them working.\u00a0 It ended up being approximately 22 people came in.\u00a0 It's called a chain.\u00a0 Isn't that wonderful?\u00a0 A chain. [Booing] TRUMP:\u00a0 And we are stuck with them.\u00a0 We are stuck with these people.\u00a0 And I don't want a chain.\u00a0 I want people to come into our country on a merit- based system. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 And I want them to help all of the great companies that are moving back into the United States.\u00a0 They are moving to Michigan, they are moving to Ohio, they are moving to Pennsylvania, they are moving to North and South Carolina.\u00a0 They are coming in, they are moving to Florida, and yes they are moving into Kentucky. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 And with what we have done, we have become so successful that we need people to come in with all these companies that are coming in.\u00a0 But we want great people that love our country, that respect our country and that want to work. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 This election is about safety and it's about prosperity.\u00a0 Since the last election - and these are numbers that the fakers back there, the fake news would never have allowed me to say. [Booing] TRUMP:\u00a0 They'd never in a million years, have I ever said this during the campaign, they would have had headlines.\u00a0 We created over 4.2 million new jobs. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 And lifted over four million Americans off of food stamps.\u00a0 You know what that means?\u00a0 The second food stamps.\u00a0 It means number one, we get rid of an unbelievable cost, you wouldn't even believe it.\u00a0 You wouldn't even believe it, but you know what else?\u00a0 You get a lot of happy people that are working.\u00a0 It's a great thing.\u00a0 It's a great thing. We've added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs.\u00a0 Remember, manufacturing is never going to come back.\u00a0 Never going to come back.\u00a0 Remember?\u00a0 The previous administration, oh, you think that's going to happen?\u00a0 You would need a magic wand.\u00a0 Well, I guess we had the magic wand.\u00a0 We had the magic wand. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 And these are great jobs and these are important jobs. Manufacturing jobs. Companies pouring back in.\u00a0 Manufacturing.\u00a0 African- American unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded in history. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 African-American poverty has reached its lowest level in history. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 Hispanic American and Asian-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in history.\u00a0 I can't believe I am still saying this.\u00a0 I am so sorry, I apologize to the women in the room.\u00a0 Remember I got 52%?\u00a0 Remember they kept saying, \"He's got ...\" the fake news.\u00a0 That's right - remember he said, they were all saying, \"He will not do well with women.\"\u00a0 Wow, did we do well with women.\u00a0 Did we do well. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 Fake news.\u00a0 We did really well with women.\u00a0 But unfortunately, the women's unemployment, Mitch, is not at a historic low, it's only the best number in 65 years. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 We let down women.\u00a0 We let down women.\u00a0 Sixty five years, 3.6%.\u00a0 As the charts grow just a little bit, it will be historic very soon.\u00a0 The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 You know about winning.\u00a0 You really know about winning.\u00a0 Those horses win.\u00a0 You people are winners.\u00a0 I am just afraid that Kentucky is winning too much. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 You are going to send Matt Bevin to see Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell and they can all going to come to the Oval Office to see me, and they are going to say, \"Mr. President, we can't do it anymore.\u00a0 Kentucky is winning too much.\u00a0 They can't do it.\u00a0 They don't like it, they don't want to do it anymore.\"\u00a0 They are going to say, we are winning so much we just don't stand it. I am going to say, Mitch and Matt and Rand, I'm sorry.\u00a0 We are going to keep winning.\u00a0 We are going to win more and more and more.\u00a0 We're going to keep winning.\u00a0 I'm sorry, folks, and I will send them happily back to Kentucky. [Cheers and Applause] TRUMP:\u00a0 You are winning a lot. WATTERS:\u00a0 That was President Trump in Richmond, Kentucky, once again firing up voters ahead of the midterm elections, and here with reaction, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and conservative columnist, Ann Coulter author of \"Resistance Is Futile.\"\u00a0 One of my favorites. All right, Ann, I want to play some sound for you - by the way, this is probably the most fair and balanced panel I have ever had.\u00a0 And because of that, I'm going to play a Democrat.\u00a0 I am just kidding.\u00a0 Anne would knock my head off.\u00a0 No, I want to play some sound of the President praising Mitch McConnell and let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:\u00a0 He goes down as the greatest leader in my opinion in history.\u00a0 What we have done is incredible together.\u00a0 But he's better when I'm president than he ever was when anybody else was president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS:\u00a0 Trump made Mitch great again, or as he's known favorably, cocaine Mitch.\u00a0 What do you think Anne?\u00a0 How are you going to turn that into immigration? ANN COULTER, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, WRITER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST, AND LAWYER:\u00a0 Okay, give me 30 seconds.\u00a0 Well, right after Kavanaugh gets through and he is in Kentucky, okay, you've got to praise Mitch McConnell. But by and large, I think the mistake of the Trump administration so far is Trump giving into the Mitch McConnell agenda rather than the other way around. McCain couldn't win - I mean, the way the country has been changed by immigration.\u00a0 McCain couldn't win, Romney couldn't win.\u00a0 Trump won, so why don't Republicans in Congress think, \"Oh, this guy knows how to do it. Let's be like him.\u00a0 Let's pass funding for the wall and get the Democrats to vote against him.\" No, they go straight back to the old Republican playbook.\u00a0 Tax cuts. Military spending.\u00a0 Continue the various wars we have around the universe. Who are the biggest stars right now in the Republican Party? Donald Trump, Lindsey Graham and that wonderful Bill Cassidy. WATTERS:\u00a0 And Corey Lewandowski.\u00a0 A big star in the Republican Party. COULTER:\u00a0 What did they do?\u00a0 They stood up to liberals.\u00a0 You know the Bill Cassidy clip I'm talking about. WATTERS:\u00a0 Yes, yes, he goes up to some woman who brought her kids and she said you are ruining my children's future. And he said, \"Your mother is making you into a pawn, don't ever be a victim like that.\" COULTER:\u00a0 And if you're ever accused falsely as an adult, don't worry, they won't get away with it. WATTERS:\u00a0 Exactly.\u00a0 And Corey, Mitch McConnell does say, he's going to get a lot of wall funding in the lame duck Congress if there is one, what do you think? COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER:\u00a0 Well, I think where you have to praise Mitch McConnell is in actually getting the Federal judges through the system.\u00a0 This president has put 84 judges into the system which has long-term ramifications for the electorate and for the people in the country for the foreseeable future.\u00a0 That is a testament for which Mitch McConnell stands. But the President has done it against the will of the Senate.\u00a0 Look, he just nominated some more people for the 9th Circuit that were with the advice and consent of the two senators from California because he says, it's time change the judiciary because they have legislators from the bench.\u00a0 We've seen this too many times. To Ann's point, the immigration issue had to go all the way to the Supreme Court for a nine nothing decision to say the president of the United States has the authority to prevent people from coming into this country that he believes are a detriment to our country.\u00a0 The same power that every president has used since World War II.\u00a0 But we have seen judges all too often legislating from the bench. To Mitch's credit, because of what the President has done, they fundamentally changed the court system that's going to have long-term ramifications in the positive. WATTERS:\u00a0 Well, if Mitch McConnell could make the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Republican, give the guy the Congressional Medal of Honor.\u00a0 I want to play some really touching sound of the president today in the Oval Office.\u00a0 He just secured the release of a prisoner abroad from Turkey. Let's watch this very special moment. In the Oval Office when he was there praying with the pastor who was just released from Turkey, can we play that. All right, so we all saw that today. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS:\u00a0 I know Ann wants to talk about immigration.\u00a0 But it was a very special moment when he secured the release of this prisoner.\u00a0 This President has done that consistently whether it's in North Korea, whether it's in Afghanistan or all around the world, the American people when they see this, there is it right there, when they see this, it shows that this President really cares about each individual American. COULTER:\u00a0 Yes, and not only that, I mean, all of the pastors, and a lot of black pastors praying with Trump during the campaign.\u00a0 I thought it was absolutely sincere and genuine when he said in response to the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, that running for president has changed him, and I just like to see Trump who is - you don't really think of as ... WATTERS:\u00a0 Look at the pious, humble Trump right there bowing down, I mean, that's just ... COULTER:\u00a0 I don't think you've ... WATTERS:\u00a0 You've never really seen that before. COULTER:\u00a0\u00a0 ... only ruler before he ran for President, but you can't have that many Christians praying over you and praying with you without that affect you. WATTERS:\u00a0 Corey, what do you think? LEWANDOWSKI:\u00a0 Okay, I think the mainstream media wants to overlook all of the success that this President has of bringing Americans home who have been captive overseas.\u00a0 No one is talking about the woman who was a captive against her own will in Egypt that he brought her home. If you remember, he went to Joint Base Andrews one night at midnight to see people come back off that plane who were overseas.\u00a0 This President has done this time and time and time again, without bucket loads of money, without pallet full of cash going overseas.\u00a0 He is not negotiating with these nations.\u00a0 He is saying, you send our people or we're going to have a problem and he is drawing a line in the sand that those other nations have continuously walked across in previous administrations and this time, they understand if you cross this person, he is not a man to be trifled with and there will be a recourse. And so, we saw that today and I think that family and the nation is very happy that he's back on US soil. WATTERS:\u00a0 And speaking of drawing ... COULTER:\u00a0 You know, if I could be the Democrat here, though that is true and Trump is drawing, I'm not really that enthusiastic.\u00a0 That's not bringing people out to vote.\u00a0 What are these people doing in ridiculous countries to begin with?\u00a0 What we wanted was a wall ... WATTERS:\u00a0 Well, yes and ... COULTER:\u00a0 We don't have to keep saving people who did - I feel like it's skiers who go off into a no-skiing area, avalanche warning, don't go, and we have to spend all this money to get them back.\u00a0 Don't go to these countries. WATTERS:\u00a0 Well, I mean, Turkey can be a very nice place to be.\u00a0 Sometimes ... COULTER:\u00a0 I'm glad we got them.\u00a0 I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's a much more important thing to protect the American people who live here. WATTERS:\u00a0 Well, speaking of that, the president really delineated that vis a vis the midterm elections.\u00a0 Here was his contrast, let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:\u00a0 The fact is Democrats have become the party of crime.\u00a0 They have. Republicans are the party of safety, and we are the party of jobs, jobs, jobs. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS:\u00a0 So the president has, I believe a gift, politically for really just in black and white terms.\u00a0 They are socialists, we are capitalists. We like law and order, they love crime.\u00a0 No other, I believe, president has ever put anything those in those stark terms before and that's driving these liberals mad. COULTER:\u00a0 He's totally right on the immigration issue though, if he goes along with Jared Kushner's idea on prison reform, he'll be the crime President.\u00a0 So warning, Mr. President. WATTERS:\u00a0 Lock him up, right, Ann? COULTER:\u00a0 One other thing about the immigration issue.\u00a0 You are right about the courts.\u00a0 The courts will not matter.\u00a0 The Kavanaugh nomination will not matter.\u00a0 If immigration changes this country enough that we can never get another Republican president.\u00a0 We're just pack the courts and all of these victories will be footprints in the sand. WATTERS:\u00a0 All right, standby, Corey is very fired up about some fake news propaganda coming out of NBC News, you guys have got to see what this company did to Donald Trump, all right, we're going to have that next. And more from the President's rally, stay tuned. Back now with Corey and Ann, all right, so NBC News and MSNBC have been running this sound bite from President Trump all yesterday and all today, and it's totally taken out of context.\u00a0 This is what NBC News has played about Donald Trump talking about the Civil War and then i'll explain what they cut out afterwards.\u00a0 Roll it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:\u00a0 So Robert E. Lee was a great general and Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia. He couldn't beat Robert E. Lee.\u00a0 He was going crazy.\u00a0 I don't know if you know the story, but Robert E. Lee was winning battle after battle after battle, and Abraham Lincoln came home and he said, \"I can't beat Robert E. Lee.\"\u00a0 And he had all of these generals, they looked great, they were top of their class at West Point.\u00a0 They were the greatest people. There was only one problem.\u00a0 They didn't know how the hell to win. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS:\u00a0 They didn't know how to win, and then the president goes on during his speech and he says, \"Ulysses S. Grant, they finally found this guy had a little bit of a drinking problem, he wasn't good looking.\u00a0 Didn't to West Point or whatever, didn't look great.\u00a0 They picked him.\u00a0 He knew how to win and he got the job done.\"\u00a0 But NBC News cut that out and now, they are just saying, \"Donald Trump praises Confederate General Robert E. Lee as great,\" Corey. LEWANDOWSKI:\u00a0 Jesse, this is the narrative the mainstream media always wants to do.\u00a0 Look, there's just a study that was released from the Media Research Center that said 92% of the coverage of this president has been negative.\u00a0 That would be fine if we were at 25% unemployment or we had the worst crime in our nation's history, but we are winning at every single turn. So what they want to do once again is be selective of their coverage with Trump.\u00a0 They don't want to give the full story.\u00a0 But I always say this, the American people are very smart.\u00a0 They are tired of the mainstream media lying to them.\u00a0 They turn to other outlets and the best thing that we have is Donald Trump directly to the American people giving his message because exactly what happened is what you said happened. He went on to say, \"Hey, we found this guy, he did a pretty good job. Ulysses S. Grant.\u00a0 Not only did he actually win the war, he actually went on to be a, become a pretty good president of the United States, too, and so maybe we should recognize him,\" and he happened to be in Ohio at the time and that was the point of the whole discussion, but NBC didn't want to talk about that. WATTERS:\u00a0 Right, and I mean, he was talking about Robert E. Lee militarily was good at killing people.\u00a0 And he didn't dwell on that, he wasn't praising the guy for what he stood for.\u00a0 Do they have editors at NBC, Ann, that can say, \"You've deceptively edited the president's sound bite?\"\u00a0 And then have totally smeared him into making him look like he is doing something he didn't do. COULTER:\u00a0 No, I am so glad you are setting this straight because as you know, my remote is spot welded to MSNBC.\u00a0 Every 10 minutes today, they are just doing this like out of the blue.\u00a0 Trump just started praising Robert E. Lee. And by the way, he was a great general.\u00a0 He has studied the way Napoleon has studied, but the point was, as Corey said, he was in Ohio.\u00a0 He was leading to the point that we, with this unbelievably great general, crushing the Union forces with about a quarter the size of the force.\u00a0 Half of his soldiers were barefoot, and he is still beating the Union Army.\u00a0 So, yes, of course, he was keeping Lincoln up at night.\u00a0 He sends in a guy from Ohio. WATTERS:\u00a0 I just can't believe that they think they get away with it. COULTER:\u00a0 Well, luckily, for you, and this show they can't. WATTERS:\u00a0 \"Watters' World\" is the Ombudsman, that's where we are.\u00a0 Over at CNN, this is what people are talking about when everybody is running around banging on doors and screaming at people, the right, rightly so has called these almost Antifa-type people, these radical left wing activists a mob. You can't say that over on CNN.\u00a0 Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 When you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out of the restaurants by a mob ... UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Oh, you are not going to use the mob word. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Oh, it's totally a mob.\u00a0 It is without a doubt. There's no other word for it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Matt, Matt, Matt.\u00a0 A mob?\u00a0 Stop.\u00a0 Stop. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS:\u00a0 You know what that reminds me of?\u00a0 Remember Fort Hood?\u00a0 That was workplace violence.\u00a0 They want to change the means of the word to fit their narrative, Corey. LEWANDOWSKI:\u00a0 Well, if it's not truth, it's just I forgot to be completely honest.\u00a0 It is amazing, Jesse.\u00a0 Look, the bottom line is, these guys are so liberal they've lost all their viewership.\u00a0 They have now gone and lost all of Middle America.\u00a0 Because here is what happened? The American people see on television Ted Cruz being drawn, chastised in a restaurant.\u00a0 They see this on multiple people, from a mob.\u00a0 This wasn't one person yelling.\u00a0 This wasn't like Jeff Flake or somebody getting yelled at, at an elevator.\u00a0 This was a mob of people, and what's amazing, Jesse, look, it never happens to me, unfortunately because I kind of look forward to that kind of stuff, to be honest with you. WATTERS:\u00a0 You do? LEWANDOWSKI:\u00a0 But the mob mentality is \"let's destroy property, let's throw rocks through windows, let's light cars on fire, let's destroy the Republican Party headquarters,;' no one wants to cover those.\u00a0 They think those are just angry individuals who want to express themselves through graffiti on your building is how they define it, but it wasn't a mob. WATTERS:\u00a0 Well, we've got to run and I just want the audience to know, Corey says he is not afraid the mob.\u00a0 He welcomes the mob.\u00a0 You know what, I'm afraid of them.\u00a0 Don't bother me at dinner. LEWANDOWSKI:\u00a0 I'm eating with Jesse tonight ... WATTERS:\u00a0 No, no.\u00a0 We're not going out at all. COULTER:\u00a0 You know I have a book on the mob you might want to mention. WATTERS:\u00a0 Well done, Ann.\u00a0 Perfect time. COULTER:\u00a0 I'm not selling it. But if you want to know about the mob, it's demonic. WATTERS:\u00a0 All right, left is completely unhinged and calling for violence against conservatives again, Tucker Carlson reacts next. ROBERT GRAY, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:\u00a0 Live from \"America's News Headquarters.\"\u00a0 I'm Robert Gray.\u00a0 New information about the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, last seen after entering the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey last week.\u00a0 Turkish officials reportedly have audio and video recordings of Khashoggi's alleged killing and a local newspaper claims his Apple watch may have captured it all. President Trump is now sending a stern warning to Saudi Arabia who some believe is behind Khashoggi's disappearance. Meanwhile, along the Florida panhandle, crews are wrapping up rescue efforts in the wake of Hurricane Michael.\u00a0 The storm claiming the lives of at least 18 people in four states as workers continue looking for survivors in some of the hardest hit areas.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands of residents along the gulf coast remain without power.\u00a0 I'm Robert Gray, now back to \"Watters' World.\" WATTERS:\u00a0 The RNC hitting back at the violent left after a week of raging protests against newly confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. New Antifa attacks unfolding on the streets of Portland and Democrats stoking radical rhetoric. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 When they go low, we kick. MAXINE WATERS, US REPRESENTATIVE, CALIFORNIA, DEMOCRAT:\u00a0 If you see anybody in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get up and you create a crowd.\u00a0 And you push back on them, and you tell them, they are not welcome. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country.\u00a0 Maybe there will be. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:\u00a0 You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Get up and please, get up in the face of some Congress people. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS:\u00a0 Tucker Carlson is here.\u00a0 He's the host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" and the author of \"Ship Of Fools\" which is sitting at number one on the New York Times bestseller list.\u00a0 Congratulations, Tucker. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT:\u00a0 Thank you, Jesse. WATTERS:\u00a0 So, in my opinion, without the power of the state, liberals don't have the House, the Senate or the White House. So now, there is no way for them to deploy liberalism.\u00a0 So they are forced to go to the streets and bully and intimidate people.\u00a0 What do you think about this tactic? CARLSON:\u00a0 I think that is true.\u00a0 I think they have the power of the HR Department in most of companies.\u00a0 I think they have the power of the tech monopolies which control all human information, so I think they have a lot of power outside of government.\u00a0 I think you're absolutely right.\u00a0 The purpose of these mobs is to affect the political end.\u00a0 It's not just that they are mad, though the kids are probably mad.\u00a0 If they have been told to be mad, so they can reach an objective, which is getting Democrats elected to positions of power.\u00a0 I mean, it's definitely only about that. WATTERS:\u00a0 And it's not about persuasion.\u00a0 They are not trying to articulate an idea and then convince voters to choose that idea.\u00a0 They are just trying to scream and harass their political enemies and trying to make them cower in fear. CARLSON:\u00a0 That's exactly right, and by the way, liberals, Democrats, if they wanted to make a case for middle class economic empowerment for populist economist, they'd probably just win actually.\u00a0 That might be just easier. WATTERS:\u00a0 Don't say that.\u00a0 There could be liberals watching, Tucker. CARLSON:\u00a0 So Trump wins out of nowhere, why not steal his ideas and make them your own?\u00a0 That's what a healthy system does.\u00a0 A rocket system does this. WATTERS:\u00a0 You're right, because you know, they never did a real assessment of why they lost in 2016.\u00a0 They totally forgot about the working class white men and women in this country and they doubled down on identity politics and instead, they could be talking about healthcare, college tuition ... CARLSON:\u00a0 Exactly. WATTERS:\u00a0 Anything else, but now, they are dwelling on Kavanaugh which is a losing issue for them. CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, because it's insane.\u00a0 I mean, the idea that the Kavanaugh debate was about an entire race of people, it's white men, I mean, that's crazy talk.\u00a0 It's totally divisive.\u00a0 And as you said, it's the cul-de-sac of identity politics, which just wrecks the country.\u00a0 I mean, you don't sort of get anything.\u00a0 I mean, maybe you get to win a midterm election on that, but you destroy the country you are governing in the end. And like most people, even liberals, Democrats are like I don't know, this is not good.\u00a0 I think most people are afraid of that kind of stuff. WATTERS:\u00a0 All right, well, speaking of afraid, the Democrats, especially the media, very afraid of Kanye West and his relationship with Donald Trump.\u00a0 Here is Kanye kind of spreading some love to the president in the Oval. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KANYE WEST, AMERICAN ARTIST:\u00a0 I love this guy right here.\u00a0 Let me give this guy a hug.\u00a0 I love this guy right here.\u00a0 Yes, amen TRUMP:\u00a0 That's really nice.\u00a0 Now, that's from the heart. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS:\u00a0 And the media reaction apoplectic.\u00a0 Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 Okay, I am doing this for everybody who is watching as they turn their volume down.\u00a0 You can put it up again.\u00a0 That was bonkers. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 But if you thought you were going to get a thoughtful play by play and political analysis, you're not because that was an assault on our White House. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 This was a giant shiny object in the Oval Office wearing a red hat. DON LEMON, ANCHOR, CNN:\u00a0 What I saw was a minstrel show today.\u00a0 Him in front of all of these white people, mostly white people, embarrassing himself and embarrassing Americans, but mostly African-Americans.\u00a0 Kanye's mother is rolling over in her grave. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 This is white supremacy via ventriloquism.\u00a0 A black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are flowing from Kanye West's mouth. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS:\u00a0 Tucker, I don't know what to say. CARLSON:\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 The last guy who is calling racism lives in my neighborhood.\u00a0 A rich, white neighborhood.\u00a0 That's hilarious.\u00a0 I mean, look ... WATTERS:\u00a0 Michael Eric Dyson, right. CARLSON:\u00a0 That's correct.\u00a0 Lives right down the block from me.\u00a0 So this is just what they think they have to say in order to make sure that none of us take what Kanye West said seriously.\u00a0 I don't know Kanye West, he seems pretty eccentric to me, it that doesn't mean he's not telling the truth about a couple of things, the most obvious, being \"Hey, if the Democratic Party is so great for black people, then why is Detroit a disaster and the south side of Chicago?\u00a0 That's a totally fair thing to say. They can't allow that to be said, so they have to crush him.\u00a0 He's crazy. By the way, if they think he's crazy, why are they attacking him?\u00a0 If you attacked a crazy homeless guy in the bus with schizophrenia, you would be a bad person, but it's okay to attack Kanye West because he's crazy? I mean, this is just purely utilitarian kind of authoritarian tactics against the guy. WATTERS:\u00a0 You're exactly right, and you know what, when his music is pumping, they're nodding their head, and when he's saying George Bush doesn't care about black people, they are nodding their heads.\u00a0 But then he says Make America Great Again, and they are shaking their heads and they are calling him crazy.\u00a0 It's pretty unbelievable.\u00a0 I want to ask you a question, and the theme of this is, where are they now? Where is Dr. Ford?\u00a0 Where is Stormy Daniels? Where is Omarosa and her case? Because the media - these were the people in the media that they were - these three people, they were going to - these were icons.\u00a0 These were icons and the media just gave them the big hug and was protecting them and showcasing them, and they have been dropped. CARLSON:\u00a0 Well, but that's always the case.\u00a0 Where is Richard Jewel who was blamed for the Atlanta bombing?\u00a0 He died.\u00a0 You know what I mean?\u00a0 What happened to Gary Conditt who we accused of murder?\u00a0 He's running a Baskin' Robbins in Bakersfield. WATTERS:\u00a0 What about that rogue film maker that caused Benghazi? CARLSON:\u00a0 Exactly. WATTERS:\u00a0 Where is he now? CARLSON:\u00a0 We use people in the media to make our point and on the left it's to support the Democratic Party.\u00a0 And once you are no longer useful, they don't care about you.\u00a0 So Stormy Daniels, I happen to know is working in strip bars in secondary towns, I mean, beer bottle store in there, nobody cares.\u00a0 Whereas has her creepy porn lawyer is out there running for President.\u00a0 He has used her and left. The media used - what happened to Mark Judge who last week we were accusing of rape because we thought it was helpful.\u00a0 He is a real person.\u00a0 He used to work for me.\u00a0 I know him.\u00a0 Whatever happened - they destroyed his life and now, nobody cares because it's not about helping individuals, it's about obtaining power.\u00a0 That's all it's about. WATTERS:\u00a0 Right, it's about the grand scheme of things and Avenatti is now trying to challenge Don, Jr. to a cage match.\u00a0 I don't know if he has Stormy's cell phone number anymore as she dances for dollars.\u00a0 So your new book, Tucker Carlson, \"Ship Of Fools.\"\u00a0 I have it right here.\u00a0 Grateful dead reference, is that what that's about? CARLSON:\u00a0 Yes, it is.\u00a0 It's also Book 7 of \"The Republic\" by Plato where he writes out to Socrates who is also with him, but look, the point is really simple, why did Trump get elected?\u00a0 No one expected it including I would say, Trump.\u00a0 It happened and that's a sign obviously the people who are making the decisions did a really bad job. They are the only ones who don't know that.\u00a0 They are instead blaming voters for this, and I think that we need to be very clear about what happened and why because we can't learn anything from it otherwise. WATTERS:\u00a0 All right, well, check out Tucker's book.\u00a0 He has knocked Bob Woodward off of the number one slot.\u00a0 There he is, Tucker Carlson.\u00a0 Thanks very much. CARLSON:\u00a0 Thank you, Jesse. WATTERS:\u00a0 Coming up. Diamond and Silk.\u00a0 And they are pretty fired up this week. The liberal media melting down over Kanye's meeting with the President on Thursday.\u00a0 Here is some of what Kanye had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WEST:\u00a0 There was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like superman.\u00a0 The liberals are trying to control a black person through the concept of racism because they know that we are very proud emotional people. The problem is illegal guns.\u00a0 The illegal guns is the problem.\u00a0 Not legal guns.\u00a0 We have the right to bear arms.\u00a0 We have to bring jobs into America because our best export is entertainment and ideas.\u00a0 But when we make everything in China and not in America, then we are cheating on our country. TRUMP:\u00a0 I'll tell you what, that was pretty impressive. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS:\u00a0 But the mainstream media has been hating on Kanye ever since he came out as a Trump supporter.\u00a0 Listen to this nasty stuff they've had to say over at CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:\u00a0 Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read.\u00a0 We have this now and Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it and he is going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:\u00a0 Black folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft.\u00a0 He's an attention whore like the President.\u00a0 He's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson, he is the token negro of the Trump administration.\u00a0 This is ridiculous.\u00a0 And no one should be taking Kanye West seriously. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS:\u00a0 Wow, here react to react, political commentators, Rob Smith and Wendy Osefo.\u00a0 Rob, does that offend you?\u00a0 Some of the language that CNN used? ROB SMITH, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FOX NEWS:\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 It's disgusting and looking at that clip, I would say Don Lemon went from an anchor at CNN to the chief overseer on the Democratic plantation because what he did was he corralled Kanye West back in using disgusting language.\u00a0 Him, Terry Setmayer and Bakari Sellers, it's disgusting to me. And what they're doing is they're trying to send a message to any other black American, to any other black conservative that supports the President that this is what we will do to you if you are vocal about that support. WATTERS:\u00a0 Wendy, what do you think about that? WENDY OSEFO, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FOX NEWS:\u00a0 My problem with Kanye is not the fact that he wants to support Donald Trump because he has the right to, my problem is that he given the ability to go to the Oval Office and he basically performed in ignorance.\u00a0 And what I mean by that is the fact that when he went there, he could have talked to Donald Trump about what's going on in Chicago, he could have talked about stop and frisk and he could have asked Donald Trump why did he cut mental health reform and why else did he cut education?\u00a0 But he did that. He used that time to basically be a minstrel show and pound on the table and ... SMITH:\u00a0 I completely disagree. WATTERS:\u00a0 Minstrel show is a strong word. OSEFO:\u00a0 And it's fine for you to disagree.\u00a0 But this is what I also think, I think that the conservative party, the GOP has to decide when is it okay for black athletes and performers to either shut and dribble or them to become the beacon of hope for your party because you can't have it both ways. WATTERS:\u00a0 Wendy, he actually did bring up stop and frisk.\u00a0 He said he doesn't like stop and frisk and told the President that he should knock it off, but go ahead. SMITH:\u00a0 And for you to call it a minstrel show, you are doing what every other black person is doing right now to anybody who dares to expouse ... OSEFO:\u00a0 That's not true. SMITH:\u00a0 You did, you just did it and first all ... OSEFO:\u00a0 It is a minstrel show. SMITH:\u00a0\u00a0 ... Kanye West talked about a lot of different things.\u00a0 He talked about the relationship between black people and the police.\u00a0 He talked about basically supporting the president and he talked about Making America Great Right Now.\u00a0 And what he wants to do ... OSEFO:\u00a0 You can support the president but you do not have to use foul language while you are in the Oval Office.\u00a0 You could support somebody but you should not bang on the table in the Oval Office.\u00a0 So what I'm just trying to say here ... (CROSSTALK) WATTERS:\u00a0 President Bill Clinton did some pretty indecent things in the Oval Office, let's not act like we're pure. OSEFO:\u00a0 We're not all pure. SMITH:\u00a0 And I don't actually remember all of this outcry when Rick Ross was in the White House and his ankle bracelet went off. OSEFO:\u00a0 Actually, I don't remember all of these outcry when LeBron James called out the President of the United States, but then you guys said, all he should do is he should shut up and dribble, so again, I want to ask you, do you want black athletes and entertainers to shut up and dribble or do you want them to become your new mascot like they are trying to do for Kanye West?\u00a0 Because you cannot have it both ways, sir. SMITH;\u00a0 It's not about black people shutting up and dribble, what it's about is black people having a seat at the table.\u00a0 What you want to do is you want to make it so controversial for any black person to have anything to do with this administration. OSEFO:\u00a0 That's not true.\u00a0 Well, let's talk about facts.\u00a0 The facts are, only 8% of black people voted for Trump. SMITH:\u00a0 You want to make an example of this, you cannot do it.\u00a0 There is a black sisterhood of movement happening right now and you can't stop it, Don Lemon can't stop it, and anybody else cannot stop it. OSEFO:\u00a0 And that's fine.\u00a0 That's okay, you can vote for Trump if you want to.\u00a0 You can vote for Trump if you want to, but you should not vote for someone who undermines black and brown communities on a daily basis. WATTERS:\u00a0 Guys, we've got to go.\u00a0 Wendy and Rob, a healthy debate. We have got to run.\u00a0 Thank you guys very much. OSEFO:\u00a0 Thank you. SMITH:\u00a0 Thanks. WATTERS:\u00a0 All right, up next, Taylor and Kanye get political.\u00a0 Diamond and Silk are getting political, too.\u00a0 Up next. You guys remember the big hysteria behind the meaning of Melania Trump's \"I really don't care, do u?\" jacket, remember that one?\u00a0 You know, she wore that after visiting an immigration separation center in Texas in the summer?\u00a0 Well now, the mystery behind the jacket is solved. Mrs. Trump revealing her hidden message in her first extensive sit-down since becoming first lady. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM LLAMAS, ABC NEWS:\u00a0 Let's talk about the jacket. MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:\u00a0 The jacket. LLAMAS:\u00a0 Why did you wear it? M. TRUMP:\u00a0 I wore the jacket to go on the plane and off the plane, and it was for the people and for the left-wing media who are criticizing me, and I want to show them that I don't care.\u00a0 You could criticize whatever you want to say, but it will not stop me to do what I feel is right. LLAMAS:\u00a0 So you were sending a message what with the jacket. M. TRUMP:\u00a0 It was kinds after message, yes.\u00a0 I would prefer that they focus on what I do and on my initiatives than what I wear. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS:\u00a0 Joining me now, Diamond and Silk and kind of ironically, we are focusing on what she is wearing in playing the sound bite, but ladies, what do you think about the jacket and the explanation? DIAMOND, VIDEO BLOGGER:\u00a0 Well, I think she gave a good explanation.\u00a0 I think she did a phenomenal job. SILK, VIDEO BLOGGER:\u00a0 Yes. DIAMOND:\u00a0 She also did a phenomenal job ignoring the biased innuendos coming from the reporter and just answering the questions because they were trying to go off salacious gossip to get a reaction out of her.\u00a0 Listen, we love our first lady and the media, especially the left-wing media treat her horribly, which is so sad. I think they should start giving her credit and start treating her like our First Lady because we love her. SILK:\u00a0 That's right. DIAMOND:\u00a0 That's who she is.\u00a0 She is our First Lady and they need to treat her with the utmost respect. WATTERS:\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0 and I don't wear anything controversial, so they can't go after me.\u00a0 I'm sure they would no matter what I did though.\u00a0 All right, so Kanye West got political as we saw, and Taylor Swift got pretty political endorsing a Senate candidate, Democrat in Tennessee, and they both happened within the same week. Yet, Kanye is savagely attacked, and Taylor Swift, everyone say, \"Oh, that's so sweet.\u00a0 Taylor is getting involved in the political process.\" Isn't there a little hypocrisy there, ladies? DIAMOND:\u00a0 Oh, there's always hypocrisy when it comes to the left.\u00a0 Listen, when you look at Kanye, what they are doing to Kanye is what we call the Willy Lynch tactic.\u00a0 This is what they are doing.\u00a0 They want to destroy his very existence so that they can hush up other black Americans. But listen, we are not telling to you walk away.\u00a0 I am telling you to run and run like H-E-L-L off the Democratic plantation from the Democratic Party, switch your party to Republican and vote Republican in this midterm. SILK:\u00a0 That's right. WATTERS:\u00a0 All right, wow, Diamond and Silk fired up about the midterms. This has me fired up.\u00a0 And this is just astounding to \"Watters' World.\" And I'll tell you why.\u00a0 There is a poll and it was done by a grouped called, I think, it was More In Common and this is wait said, 80% of Americans think political correctness is a problem this country.\u00a0 But wait until you see the breakdown here. Look at the groups who think it's the biggest problems?\u00a0 American Indians are fed up with political correctness.\u00a0 Hispanics, Asians, Caucasians, African-Americans - pretty much the entire country hates political correctness.\u00a0 I mean, this changes everything with \"Watters' World.\"\u00a0 I mean, going back out on the streets, what I used to do.\u00a0 I mean, unbelievable.\u00a0 Ladies, what do you think about political correctness.\u00a0 This makes everything seem different now. DIAMOND:\u00a0 Well, listen.\u00a0 People are tired of the political correctness that is going on in this country.\u00a0 When you look at social media, when you look at universities and schools.\u00a0 If you say the wrong thing, people want to hush you up.\u00a0 Listen, if they don't stop political correctness, what you are going to see the suicide of America.\u00a0 You are not going to know America. We are going have to stick to the truth.\u00a0 We are going to have to tell the truth because the truth and nothing but the naked truth is what is going to set us all free. SILK:\u00a0 That's right. WATTERS:\u00a0 Well, the truth will set you free.\u00a0 And your new movie, I hear is coming out Monday.\u00a0 There it is, Dummycrats coming to a theater near you on Monday.\u00a0 Ladies, get the popcorn. DIAMOND:\u00a0 Get the popcorn, October the 15th, one-night premier.\u00a0 Get your tickets, dummycratsthemovie.com. WATTERS:\u00a0 All right, there it is, Diamond and Silk everybody, go check out Dummycrats and get yourselves some popcorn with some extra butter.\u00a0 Ladies, thank you very much.\u00a0 Up next, \"Last Call.\" Time now for \"Last Call.\"\u00a0 Our thoughts and prayers are with all the victims of Hurricane Michael.\u00a0 The vicious storm slammed the Florida panhandle earlier this week with torrential rain and winds in excess and rain of 155 miles per hour.\u00a0 Mexico Beach, Florida was one of the hardest hit areas.\u00a0 Entire neighborhoods were completely wiped away by winds and storm surge.\u00a0 Search and rescue crews still going door to door looking for survivors. Michael then tore through the Mid-Atlantic Region leaving behind massive amounts of destruction.\u00a0 So far as least 17 people in four states have been killed and officials fear the number will rise. Unbelievable.\u00a0 All right, well, listen our thoughts and prayers are with everybody down there.\u00a0 That's all for us tonight.\u00a0 Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\u00a0 \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" is next.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARK LEVIN, HOST: Hello, America. I'm Mark Levin, this is \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" and I have a great guest, Rick Harrison, how are you, sir? RICK HARRISON, BUSINESSMAN AND REALITY TV STAR: I'm doing great. LEVIN: You know, you're an entrepreneur, a very successful businessman. A couple of questions, just to begin with here. You never went to college, did you? HARRISON: Nope. LEVIN: All of this talk about free college, free college and you can't make it unless you went to college. How far in high school did you go? HARRISON: Finished the ninth great. LEVIN: The ninth grade? HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: Then what happened? HARRISON: A little bit of job here. I started buying and selling stuff, basically educated myself, and then I had always been buying and selling stuff. My dad had a little coin shop and I wanted a pawnshop, so I went down to city hall and they told me, \"No, you can't get a pawnshop. LEVIN: In Las Vegas? HARRISON: In Las Vegas, and I asked them why, and they pulled out the City Code and apparently what happened in 1955, the good old boys got together and they passed a city ordinance that when the city population got to quarter of a million, they would issue one more pawn license. I mean, when they made this law, there was only 25,000 people living in Vegas, they thought it was never going to happen. So, I'm 22 years old, and a pawn license, if someone has one for sale back then, it was $500,000.00, $700,000.00, something like that, and I definitely couldn't afford that. So once I read this law, I'm going, \"It's got to be close to that now for the city proper there.\" And so, I started calling the city statistician once a week and in April of '88, he said, \"Yes, we think it's a quarter of a million.\" So, I'm no longer naive, 22-year-old, I'm a naive 23-year-old. I go to the city business license, it's a quarter of a million, I want my license. They didn't give it to me. But six months later, a judge said, he was the first one there, \"Give him the license.\" LEVIN: You had to go to court to get a license to open a store? HARRISON: Yes. And the rest is sort of history. LEVIN: Let's talk a little bit about the history. So, you finished the ninth grade. HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: And you are self-educated? HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: You read, you read, you read. HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: What did you read? HARRISON: It will go back to when I was a kind. I mean, I was a really sick kid. I developed epilepsy when I was eight years old and I would have violent seizures, and I would - literally, I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't walk - sometimes I couldn't walk for a week or two, and my mom went to the library. I mean, we were lower middle income. My dad was in the Navy, he was in Vietnam. My mom was trying to sell real estate on the side. We didn't have a lot of money. LEVIN: And you were in San Diego back then? HARRISON: Yes, San Diego, and this was in 1973. There is no cable. There is no kids programming on television and we definitely didn't have the money for more than one TV in the house. My mom had got me a set of books that was sort of kismet, this really like changed my life. She went to the library and it was john d. Fitzgerald's \"The Great Brain,\" it was about an eight-year-old kid growing up in Utah in the 1890s coming up with all of these little schemes to make money, and I just devoured the books. I think there was like eight books in the series, I read them in a week or two, and I just fell in love with reading ever since then. I mean, I was 12 years old, I was going to the library and checking out books on Physics. HARRISON: So, you're self-educated, mostly through books that you read on your own. HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: And so when we watch you on your show, \"Pawn Stars,\" and you see things come in and you know a little bit of the background, the stuff that you've read in the past kind of clicks in. HARRISON: Yes, because I don't really get into fiction. It's always been science books. It's been history books. I mean, like one of the jokes I tell is I read the history of batteries twice. I found it so fascinating, and to this day, I still read things like that, and once you develop a really diverse knowledge in your head, when you see something, you can start figuring things out, I guess. LEVIN: You and I have gotten to know each other. HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: We're friends. I've gotten to know that you have a political mind, too. You have a philosophical mind. And before we get into though, I think people want to know more about your family. Now, your father just passed on. HARRISON: Yes, my father was an amazing guy. Twenty years in the Navy, great father. you know, I had epilepsy when I was a kid. He did not treat me one bit different because of it. When I was 12 years old, it was 5:30 in the morning, Saturday morning, \"Get out of bed, grab your meal bags,\" because my dad would not buy apartments unless there was a condemned sticker on every door, because he would get them so much cheaper and we all ... LEVIN: He was investing in real estate. HARRISON: Yes, so when I was - he started making me work construction when I was 12 years old. I mean, like I said, he never treated me differently. LEVIN: He worked hard his whole life. HARRISON: He did. He was always a hard worker. He had the world's greatest work ethic. He used to always tell me like family is everything. There is no choice about taking care of your kids, and, you know, like I said, me, both my brothers, we worked construction with him when we moved to Las Vegas. When I was 16, you know, he ended up going broke in '81, and all of a sudden, we're going to move to the land of milk and honey. We're going to move to Vegas, okay, because he had a little business where he bought and sold gold on the side, and so, he came to Vegan to open a little coin shop. And I worked with him then, and then just kept on working with him my whole life. LEVIN: And you two really got along, didn't you? HARRISON: We always got along. I mean, there was the joke that I'd always tell that's like the greatest thing about my business is working with my family and the worst part of my business is working with my family. But he was my best friend. He was my best friend my entire adult life. LEVIN: And you get into this pawn business. Did you know anything about the pawn business? HARRISON: I knew about buying gold and silver, and I knew the basics. There was this old pawn broker in town that I met that helped me figure out the book work and everything and helped me out. I'd call him almost every day for the first year, but got it figured out, and I knew from the beginning that I had to be different than the other guys. There was a couple of independent pawnshops in town. But most of them were owned by really large chains. Most people don't realize this, there is one chain of pawnshops in the United States with a thousand stores and there is another one with a thousand stores, I mean, so I realized quickly you can't go head-to-head with Walmart, I had to be Tiffany's. I mean, like in the early 90s, I mean, there's like - there's always going to be a Picasso on the wall. This place has to be immaculately clean, just the best employees, everything better than everybody else. LEVIN: Did you make money from day one? HARRISON: Basically, yes. I mean, it was a struggle because when you start a pawnshop, you are loaning out money all the time. When you first start, you are loaning out money and not bringing in a lot. It was a struggle. LEVIN: I'm asking this because you came from very little, you didn't go to college, you didn't get a high school diploma, and according to many people in our country, that's it, you're never going to succeed, and you're an example of somebody who says, \"Wait a minute, I've got my own brain. I've got my two hands, relatively good health. I am going to succeed, and in America I can succeed.\" Is that right? HARRISON: It's true. I mean, you know, I think it would be a lot harder for me to do the same thing today because there is just so much government BS you have to go through. I mean, there's constantly a new law, some new rule regulation, more and more difficult to fire a bad employee. I mean, in the '80s, I could go down and get a business license and be open in three weeks. Now, it's three or four months, and it's like that with almost everywhere in this country. It's just the layers and layers of BS. So much more difficult for, you know, a young couple sitting at the kitchen table saying, \"Hey, should we go open our own business?\" You're going to need a lot more money. There's going to be a lot more BS, there's a lot more expenses. It's slowly getting better. LEVIN: Didn't they just make it more difficult though on the internet? Now, the Supreme Court rules that, yes, states can tax the internet. So now you have 50 states, District of Columbia, the territories, some guy wants to start a business like you, he doesn't have a lot of capital. He wants to go on the internet, can't really afford a brick and mortar store, and he's got to be able to, or she, to file taxes in every state of the union and then some. HARRISON: And then some, I mean, you look at California. California, I think has got 59 counties, and in those counties, they have different - I mean, they have a couple hundred different sales tax rates, and there's - you can't - basically what you do is just make it more and more difficult, and it's just the insanity of government. LEVIN: And yet, we have conservatives celebrating that. Saying, yes, now it's equal with retail shops. And I'm thinking to myself, \"Equal what?\" In other words, money flows like water. If people want to go over here with their money, they're going to go over here with money. If they want to go - why is the government's business to make anything equal, whatever that means? HARRISON Yes, I mean, it's the whole idea of - well, it's the safe spacers, cry room people, everything has got to be fair. There is no definition of fair. I mean, when you get taxes like - I mean, there's no way anybody can figure that out on their own. LEVIN: You mean all these various taxes in jurisdictions and so forth? HARRISON: Yes, I mean, I really like Trump. I mean, I think he's doing an amazing job. LEVIN: You're a big fan of his. HARRISON: Yes, a big fan of his. I don't agree with everything he does. Ed Koch had a great line when he was running for mayor in New York, \"I believe in nine out of 12 things I stand for. Vote for me. If you believe in 12 out of 12, have your head examined.\" But as far as him beating up on Amazon and online businesses. I don't understand ... LEVIN: Amazon is successful because people use it, otherwise it wouldn't be there, would it? HARRISON: Yes, it's like the argument they had years ago that Walmart was beating up on the grocery stores. Well, the grocery stores got the mom- and-pop small grocery stores out of business, there used to be general, like the general store in town. It's an evolution of business, and in the end, we all have a better life because of it. LEVIN: Because, is it not true that a capitalist economy is a dynamic vibrant economy, and competition creates different products, different outlets and people respond to it and that's how we what's successful and what's not successful? HARRISON: Yes, I mean, it's survival of the fittest, and in the end, everyone has a better life because of it. Take for example, in 1850, the watch capital of the world was London. The majority of the pocket watches in the world were made in London. Right around that same time, machine tools became a lot less expensive, precision machine tools. Little watch companies start popping up around the United States. By 1890, the best watches in the world hands down were American watches. As a matter of fact, they were so good that the Europeans were trying to sell watches with American sounding names. That's why Congress had to pass a law saying the origin of watch has to be printed on the dial. That's because in London, it took 17 different unions to make a watch or they called them guilds. You can make a dial of a watch but you couldn't paint it, okay. There was a separate guild that made the hands, there was a separate guild that made the cases. It's just massive bureaucracy. And in 1890s, they were making in London the same watches they were making in 1820, and that's just one example of capitalism. There's a million examples out there. Socialism doesn't work, a big government doesn't work. LEVIN: And yet, when we come back, I want to discuss that with you, because this debate over democratic socialism seems to be going hot and heavy, at least in one party, and the power of government in terms of commerce seems to be accepted by both parties, or at least people in both parties. So we'll discuss that as soon as we come back. Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, you can watch me on Levin TV most week nights, just go to crtv.com, crtv.com or give us a call 844-LEVIN TV, 844- LEVIN TV. We'd love to have you. We'll be right back. Rick Harrison, you're part of the culture. You've got one of the most popular TV shows in America, one of the highest rated TV shows on cable. I'm sure people know who you are when you're walking - I know that in Las Vegas, because when we were with you, everybody was \"Hey, Rick, Rick, Rick,\" so ... HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: You're speaking out more about the country. You're speaking out more about capitalism, about liberty. Is that because you're recognized and you're part of the culture and concerned about the future of the country? HARRISON: Well, yes, I am concerned about the future of the country. I mean, I have six kids. I have three grandkids. And there is going to be an economic reckoning in this country eventually. You know, the government will give you all their voodoo economics about how Social Security is fully funded. It's insanity. It's the equivalent of me saying I had a million dollars and loaned it to myself and I gave myself an IOU but then I went out and partied and spent all the money, but I'm still a millionaire because I owe it to yourself. LEVIN: There's no money in Social Security. HARRISON: They have a Social Security trust fund, but there is no Social Security trust fund. LEVIN: The government took all the money. HARRISON: The government spent all the money, and ... LEVIN: Don't people go to prison for stuff like that, in the private sector? HARRISON: Yes, I mean, it's like, it's everything with government statistics. They waste the money. It's really - the insanity just keeps growing - it seems like it's growing every year. Do you know that the Bureau of Labor Statistics still gets most of its information from doing land line surveys and like, I don't know what demographic still has a land line. LEVIN: I don't have a land line anymore. HARRISON: I don't either. They still go to grocery stores with a clipboard to get prices and it's all this - because the government can never fire anybody, and it really - it just concerns me that eventually we'll have an economic reckoning. LEVIN: Is it the massive debt? HARRISON: It's the massive debt and eventually they will have to monetize the debt and it will cause inflation. LEVIN: Venezuela. HARRISON: Yes, look at Venezuela. Some of the richest natural resources in the world, it has more oil than Saudi Arabia, but this is another thing that liberals really irk me on. They complain when a CEO makes $20 million a year. They have no problem when a sports star makes $20 million a year, and the fact of the matter is those CEOs that take care of the big oil companies and the big internet companies and all of that - the reason they get paid that kind of money is they are no different than a big sports star. They are guys who - they have that skill set just like LeBron James has the skill set and when you have a politician going like, \"I can run an oil company.\" No, you can't. So, a perfect example is Venezuela where they have more oil than Saudi Arabia and they can't make any money off their oil and gas system. LEVIN: And they were giving everybody free stuff. Now, they don't have any stuff to give anybody. HARRISON: The average Venezuelan, I read, lost 15 pounds last year because of food shortages. And that's what socialism leads to. LEVIN: What does socialism create? Does it create products? Does it create wealth? Or does it just redistribute what other people create? HARRISON: Well, it creates a system where there's - in capitalism, it's survival of the fittest. That's why this car company is competing. Every car company is trying make a better car because people are going to buy the best car. When you have socialism, everything is ran by the government. They don't care if their car is any good. It's the only car. That's what you get, and so socialism ... LEVIN: Obamacare? Similar? HARRISON: Yes, similar. LEVIN: What has Obamacare done to your business in specific? HARRISON: I do pretty well. But it's triple the price of insurance on my employees and I don't think the insurance is - the medical care is as good. There's a lot of little incremental things that can be done to help medical care in this country. I believe the social safety net, but you can't pay for everything. The government can't pay for everything. LEVIN: What if people don't mind paying into the social safety net, but don't want to be part of the social safety net. Isn't that the problem with Obamacare? We're all kind of sucked into that vortex? HARRISON: Yes, and then it's like what we were talking about earlier, once everyone is getting something for free, they never want to give it back. Capitalism works. Look at the price of medical care over the past 20 years, okay? But elective surgeries, those prices have gone down over the past 20 years because you have capitalism working there. There's a million other things, too with medical care, you have tort laws where everybody is suing everybody. I read once that almost every prescription drug out there has a lawsuit against it. LEVIN: I don't doubt it because some states when you drive around, like in Florida, every other billboard is personal injury lawyers? Every other commercial on the radio is personal injury lawyers? HARRISON: I mean, so people don't want to realize it's an imperfect world, you know? Not everything is going to work right. There's always - some people are allergic to peanuts, some people are going to be allergic to a drug, and you get so much bureaucracy involved, you get so many lawyers involved and everything is sort of, \"eh\" with medical insurance and things like that. I don't know the exact solution for medical care, but just - more government is definitely not the answer. LEVIN: All right, don't forget, every week night, almost, you can watch me on Levin TV if you join us at crtv.com, crtv.com, as a matter of fact, we have 20 wonderful hosts there on our conservative digital network, that's crtv.com. Or give us a call at 844-LEVIN TV. LAUREN GREEN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Lauren Green. A powerful earthquake killing at least 82 people in Indonesia just one week after another quake killed more than a dozen in the same area. Today's 7.0-magnitude quake hitting the tourist island of Lombok this morning, hundreds were injured and thousands of homes damages. Some of that damage happening as far away as the neighboring island of Bali. A small plane crash in California killing all five people on board earlier today. The FAA saying the pilot of the twin-engine Cessna declared an emergency before crashing in a southern California Staples parking lot about a mile from Orange County's John Wayne Airport. Officials say no one on the ground was hurt. The FAA and the NTSB are now investigating the cause of the crash. I'm Lauren Green. Now back to \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" LEVIN: Socialism. Democratic socialism. We have a 28-year-old who was elected in the primary - the Democratic primary, not elected yet, in New York. She got around 17,000 votes, and she's on every major news outlet. They're saying this is the future of the Democratic Party. This is being celebrated. Why would this be celebrated? HARRISON: Well, I mean, you have basically a large - no one has taught - okay, here's an example, okay? Every kid coming out of high school thinks a corporation is evil, but they have no idea what a corporation is, and like I've explained this to a million young people that work for me. A corporation is a piece of paper. A piece of paper cannot be evil. You might have really bad guys running a corporation, but a corporation in itself can't be bad. And you wouldn't have that cell phone without a corporation, you wouldn't have a car without a corporation, you wouldn't have the power on at your house without a corporation. Corporations are one of the greatest inventions of all time. It's a way to combine capital without any risk above and beyond the amount of capital, and to create wealth. There's not a single person that can come up with the money just to start a massive car company. He's going to have to get to go out to market to get money, but this doesn't taught to anybody. This isn't taught to any one of the kids. All they're taught is that corporations are evil. They go to college and they're basically told by these liberal professors that have never lived in the real world, everything should be free, and like Margaret Thatcher said, socialism is great until you run out of other people's money. It has never worked. All it does is, the socialists say everyone will be equal and you'll be equally miserable and equally poor. LEVIN: They always talk about the top 1%, there's always a top 1%. I don't care if you go to the poorest nation on the face of the earth. Somebody has an extra bowl of rice, I guess, they're the top 1%. HARRISON: Yes, and they talk about how trickle-down economics is so evil and terrible. I think the whole word trickle-down economics is not a great phrase for it, but like I was explaining to my 17-year-old daughter, a wealthy guy goes out and buys a jet and everyone at the jet factory works and then everyone at the local airport that maintains that jet works. He's got to hire a pilot, and all these people are working because we take that rich guy's money away, you have dozens of people not working. So their entire argument is completely false. LEVIN: You think part of the problem is that we live in the greatest, most successful economy mankind has ever known where people in this country - blue collar workers, white collar workers, union, nonunion - live better than kings and queens ever lived, ever lived and that because we're so close to it, we don't see it? HARRISON: I think so. I mean, this is the only country in the world where you can live in an apartment with air-conditioning. You've got two TVs, a refrigerator full of food. You have a car in the driveway, a little money in the bank, and you're poor. LEVIN: We hear this propaganda day in and day out through the culture whether it's the Democratic Party, some in the Republican Party, the media, as you say, you are indoctrinated through education, but it could also be that so many people in this country now rely on government. They're subsidized by government and now those who aren't, figure, \"Well, wait that guy is subsidized by government, shouldn't I be subsidized, too?\" HARRISON: Yes, I mean, it's basically everyone wants something for free. We're not taught to be self-reliant. Morality is no longer taught in school. I go talk at troubled high schools, you know, and I try and talk like they talk. I tell these kids, all you guys want to be a baller or you guys want to be like really super cool. Some of you become super cool, be a little bit of a nerd. Get an education, get a job, and wait until have you kids when you're married, okay? Because you do those three things, you've just reduced your chances of being in poverty by 95%. But for some reason, they're not allowed to teach that in school. It's just common sense, and it boggles my mind. I mean, look on some of these news channels, these people supposedly have a college education and they're touting socialism, which to me is just sort of mind- boggling. I mean, obviously, you cheated a lot, but socialism is - it sounds so great, though. That's why people embrace it. The government is going to pay for everything, it sounds great. Economically it can't happen. LEVIN: Do you think more and more people have difficulty dealing with liberty? Liberty. Freedom to fail. To succeed. To go out there and be whomever you want to be. Do you think too many people are afraid of doing that or they don't comprehend what it means to be a free person? HARRISON: I think they don't comprehend it and we're raising an entire generation that gets a participation trophy. LEVIN: What about our generation that runs the government, and our generation that pushes this agenda? Chuck Schumer, he's our generation; Nancy Pelosi, well, she is a generation behind, but you get the point. HARRISON: I truly believe that if you're older and you're educated and you're touting socialism, you're either not that intelligent or you're evil. I mean, it comes down to that. LEVIN: Power hungry, maybe? HARRISON: Power hungry. Power hungry is basically evil in most situations; and they're completely intellectually dishonest. The things that come out of Chuck Schumer's mouth literally, he knows what he's saying is BS, but he's playing to the cameras, he knows the press will play to him, and you know, he has an agenda, he's power hungry. LEVIN: If you're such a powerful politician and you can influence the future of the country, and you know what you're saying is BS, isn't that a problem with virtue, then? HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: So he and people of that ilk who promote what they know is simply impossible, and yet the damage that can result from it lack virtue? HARRISON: It's the old adage, power corrupts - absolute power corrupts absolutely, and they will do anything to hold onto that power. LEVIN: Because I don't want to put words in your mouth. HARRISON: I know, you're not putting words in my mouth. You go back to the founding fathers. Those were people who really seemed to care. They risked their entire lives. They risked fortunes, their lives, their families, everything on building this country, and now we have a lot of politicians out there and it's all about getting re-elected. Look at Congress, we just had one guy in Congress for 50 years? LEVIN: Yes, but can we do without him? I mean, he's indispensible and I can't remember his name. HARRISON: It's so difficult to like reach out to the public because we determine our politicians on 30-second commercials. LEVIN: Right. We'll be right back. Rick Harrison. You're libertarian? Conservative? It depends on the issue? You're Republican? Democrat? Pro-Trump? Anti-Trump? Tell us. HARRISON: More of a libertarian. Pro-Trump, mostly. Like I said, I don't agree with everything he does. LEVIN: What do you agree with? HARRISON: Lower taxes, less government. Because in the end, that's what works. And it's just not a theory, you can go throughout history, when we had less government, you have a better economy, you have better lives, better everything. All government does is slow everything down. Government caused the great depression. LEVIN: Let's hit that for a second. Government caused the great depression. We're talking about the depression in the 30s. HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: And basically what happened there was you had a recession - a bad recession and government intervenes. Government does two things, tell me if I'm right. Tariffs. Tariffs again and then monetary policy. Tightens money rather than loosens money as Milton Friedman would say, and so they turned the recession into the great depression. Do I have that about right? HARRISON: Yes. In 1936, right when everything was getting better, we had positive GDP growth in 1936, tightened up monetary policy again and created another straight back into the depression. I mean, like in 2000 - right after 9/11, the Fed massively lowered interest rates, which in turn, all the pension funds around the United States. They have a basic model - 6% return, they'll be able to pay the pensions in the end. But now, they can't get yield, so they started chasing the yield, and that's when these collateralized debt obligations - all of these crazy things started happening because if they didn't get the yield, the entire model would collapse. LEVIN: They didn't get their 6%. HARRISON: They didn't get - average 6% and so they had to chase yield and that's what caused the whole - everything to burst in 2008 because the Federal Reserve is always trying to keep us out of a recession or things like that. LEVIN: Is that the job? What was the original job of the Federal Reserve? Wasn't it just to keep the currency stable? HARRISON: It was to keep the currency stable and keep the banks stable. LEVIN: Now what does it do? Runs the economy after ... HARRISON: They're trying to run the economy and it's an impossible situation. It's government trying to run something. Capitalism needs a recession every once in a while to separate the weak from the chaffed, okay? The economy slows down, the bad businesses goes out of business, the good businesses stay in business. Everything is more efficient that way. It sounds cruel. LEVIN: ... do that? HARRISON: But when you have a politician speaking and everything, like we don't want a recession. Some people might lose their job and I'll lose my office. It's not a perfect world and these things have to happen to have a stable economy. You perpetually prop up - the more you prop up an economy is, the harder it's going to fall. It's like Adam Smith in \"The Wealth of Nations,\" the unseen hand will of - the economy will balance itself out, but when you start getting the government and they are pushing up something really high, eventually it's not going to fall ... LEVIN: You talk about Adam Smith and the invisible hand where millions and millions of people are making independent decisions. Untold number of decisions every day about their lives, about their business, about their family, and the invisible hand is that we all interact with each other. We know what we want better than anybody else knows what we want and so forth and so on. So when the government intervenes, basically, it's a relative handful of people with an army of bureaucrats telling us what we want, telling us what we need. How can those handful of people, those masterminds know as much as all the rest of us, and isn't the problem that they can give us a piece of cheese, but to explain how we get a piece of cheese actually requires people to pay attention for about three minutes so you can explain it. HARRISON: I mean it's literally an office worker telling a plumber how to do his job. There is a need for government. We do need - we need roads, we need a system of educating our kids. I think there should be vouchers for teaching our kids so there is school choice. We need to make sure no one is shooting at us and some things like that, but the bureaucracy we have now. What did the Department of Commerce do? LEVIN: It certainly doesn't promote commerce. We'll be right back. I want to circle backa little bit with you. Corey, your oldest son. HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: Chum Lee, his best friend, almost like a son to you. HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: Do they have similar views of the world that you have? HARRISON: Yes, they do. LEVIN: They do? Is Chum Lee, let me just be blunt, is he sharper than he appears to be? HARRISON: Yes, he can be absolutely. He's a comic genius. I'll give you that. He has his moments where he is like ... LEVIN: Spaces out? HARRISON: Yes, but literally, he gets me a Father's Day present every year. I love him like a son. At times, he can be brilliant. I own a shopping center right next to the pawnshop and he came to me and says, \"Can I rent out a store for a candy shop?\" I'm like, \"Who's going to do your books and everything like that?\" It was brilliant because he had a bunch of candy branded with his - it's Chum Candy and he goes over there, and when he's there, there's a massive line because everyone wants to take a picture with him at his candy store and everything like that, and he does really, really well. LEVIN: So he knows how to market? He knows how to ... HARRISON: Yes, market. LEVIN: How about Corey? What's he like? HARRISON: Corey. LEVIN: He strikes me as really bright. HARRISON: He is really bright. He owns the beauty bar - it was voted the number one dive bar in Las Vegas. But apparently people like dive bars because so you can even walk in the place on a Friday and Saturday night. He does well with that. He's really a bright - I'm really proud of him. He can be - he's young and single so he can be a little rambunctious and piss me off every once in a while, but he is an amazing guy. LEVIN: Do you, your family, are you big collectors? You see all this wonderful stuff walk through the door ... HARRISON: Yes, I have an entire house decorated in pawnshop motif. I have - like in my office I have maps of the island of California. I have ... LEVIN: What's the most interesting or rare or valuable thing that you have? HARRISON: The most interesting thing is probably this right here. I showed it to you earlier. LEVIN: And this right here ... HARRISON: It's a 1200-year-old biking bracelet, circa 800. LEVIN: And somebody walked into your the store with this? HARRISON: Yes. LEVIN: What did you pay for that? HARRISON: I think $7,000.00 or $8,000.00. A lot of people think it would be worth a lot more. I explain this value a lot of the times. You take an item that's $10,000.00, it should be worth so much more. But it's the free market, there are a million other really ... LEVIN: You know what we have over here? We have the mirror that was over the Reagan - in the Reagan home over their fireplace for years and years and years, that was the mirror. HARRISON: That's amazing. LEVIN: And I'm not selling it to you, either. And we're thrilled to have it. But anyway, we'll be right back. Rick Harrison, you told us you had epilepsy and it actually led to you self-educating, you're a brilliant man, you know so much about so many things. You're on the board of the Epilepsy Foundation. How did that happen? HARRISON: They came to me and wanted to know if I would do some PSAs, because one of the people read my book and I talked about having epilepsy as a child. I did the PSAs and a few other things for him, and they literally called me up one day and said, \"We just had a board of directors meeting, you've been drafted. You're on the board of directors.\" And it has been rewarding. I do a couple hundred hours a year, raising money for them, interacting with kids, and basically having a good time doing it. LEVIN: What do they do? They basically support research? HARRISON: We support research. We pay for kids' medicine, we pay for doctor visits, we want to raise awareness. There's always been a stigma associated with epilepsy. LEVIN: What causes epilepsy? HARRISON: It's basically a short circuit in your brain. It's an electrical storm and it could be all over your brain or certain parts of your brain, and they're slowly making advances with it. I really truly believe eventually there will be a cure. I'm not going to get super technical with you on that, but it's near and dear to my heart. LEVIN: How widespread is it? HARRISON: It's a lot more prevalent than you think. More people have epilepsy than autism, but you hear more about autism. It's more than Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis and a whole host of diseases combined, people have epilepsy. But there's always been a stigma attached to it, so people sort of suppress it. LEVIN: Can people have it? But the attacks are so infrequent that they don't even know they have it? HARRISON: If you have a seizure, you're going to know it. There are some people, you have, like they'll have small seizures when they sleep and they don't even know it. It's a disease that I think just a lot more people need to know about or maybe need some more awareness about it, and hopefully I'm going to find a cure for it one day, well, not me, the Epilepsy Foundation, not me. LEVIN: It's been an absolute pleasure talking to you, meeting with you. A lot of people are huge fans of yours and they want to know more about you, and we've become good friends and I know a lot about you about your philosophical take on things and so forth, so it was a pleasure having you. HARRISON: Thanks for having me. LEVIN: All right, God bless. See you next time on \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" June 1, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, we have incredible, amazing news on three major fronts. Buckle up tonight. First, the June 12th summit with North Korea is officially back on. A huge development. As earlier today, a top deputy from the hermit kingdom hand delivered a letter from Kim Jong-Un to President Trump. We'll tell you what we know about this letter in just a moment. And also tonight, President Trump is succeeding in a massive way. Bad news for Democrats when we do great here at home because the economy is booming. The job numbers are breaking even more records. And 3.8 unemployment. The lowest African-American unemployment in history. A jobs market so robust even the New York Times today is saying, quote, \"They are running out of words to describe how good the economy really is.\" And we'll contrast this economy to former President Barack Obama's pathetic economy. And also tonight, we have major breaking news from John Solomon. A brand- new bombshell report detailing how the Obama administration may have pressured the FBI to monitor the Trump campaign before that so-called official investigation was even authorized. Solomon's report also uncovers the FBI's possible misconduct surrounding their use of spies. And Sara Carter with breaking news. She's blowing the whistle on even more spying abuse against the Trump campaign, including a possible coordinated effort to monitor Trump associates by some of our closest allies abroad. This is now beginning to get so much bigger than we ever thought. Both Solomon and Sara Carter will be here in just a minute. And meanwhile, the former CIA director, deep state sycophant, John Brennan, is calling President Trump paranoid. We'll respond to Brennan's latest ridiculous meltdown in a few minutes. And also, we'll highlight some of the growing calls for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Lindsey Graham is now joining us. So much to cover. Sit tight. Buckle up. A very important Friday breaking-news opening monologue. Tonight, major, major progress on three big fronts, especially with the president and North Korea and the negotiations. The June 12th summit is back. Only hours ago, a top lieutenant from North Korea named Kim Yong Chol hand delivered a personal note from Kim Jong-Un to President Trump. And according to the Wall Street Journal, this note was described as fairly basic, but reportedly expressed Kim Jong-Un's interest in holding the nuclear summit. Earlier today, here is how the president reacted. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll meet on June 12th in Singapore. It went really well. It's really a get-to-know-you kind of a situation. Mike has spent two days doing this. We've gotten to know their people very well. And we will -- you people will have to travel because you will be in Singapore on June 12th. And I think it will be a process. I never said it will goes in one meeting. I think it is going to be a process. But the relationships are building and that is a very positive. Talking about years of hostility, years of problems and years of really hatred between so many different nations. But I think you will have a very positive result in the end. Not from one meeting. We'll not go sign -- we're not going to go in and sign something on June 12th. We never will. We'll start a process. And I told them today, take your time. We can go fast, we can go slowly. But I think they would like to see something happen. And if we can work that out, that would be good. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Do you believe Kim is committed to denuclearization? TRUMP: Yes, I do think so. He would like to see it happen. He wants to be careful. He wants to be -- he's not going to run and do things. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: That's the president. Great news, by the way, for entire world. And look at what we've won so far. The president is scheduled to hold a series of weekend briefings at Camp David about this upcoming summit where the United States plans to negotiate the complete, the unilateral denuclearization of North Korea and the Korean peninsula. Amazing news to the world. There's promise, there's hope. And by the way, your media said it would never happen. We're going to have a lot more on this later in the show tonight. But first, huge, massive news on the economic front. The economy in the United States is booming officially. We are breaking records month after month. In May, a robust 223,000 jobs were added. The unemployment rate in the United States is at an 18 year low. Jobless claims dropping to 3.8 percent. We have only seen a number that low since 1969. The Mets won the World Series. And get this. African-American unemployment at an all-time low for the first time, 5.9 percent. Consumer confidence at a 17-year high. Look at that headline from the New York Times. This had to kill them: \"We ran out of the words to describe how good the job numbers are.\" And the president's economic agenda is clearly succeeding. And despite the \"Destroy Trump\" media, tells you night after night after night, this country in a so much better place, more prosperous place with President Trump at the helm. Numbers do not lie. Let's take a trip down memory lane and contrast this with President Obama's horrific economic track record. Saw virtually no growth. Record high distribution of food stamps, 13 million more Americans were on food stamps. Eight million more Americans were in poverty. We had the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s, the worst homeownership rate in 51 years, the worst recovery since the `40s. And he doubled the national debt. Yes, that was Barak Obama's record. We'll get back to the major news on the economic front later on in the show. Now we have to turn to some other breaking news tonight. This is huge from John Solomon. His brand-new bombshell report, the FBI's efforts to monitor the Trump campaign actually originated months before the FBI authorized the counterintelligence investigation into so-called Russian election interference. This after, quote, \"Foreign figures contacted Trump campaign advisors and provided the FBI with heresy allegations of Trump/Russia collusion.\" According to John Solomon, these foreign figures, including some of the trusted intelligence sources and even some Hillary Clinton supporters. In other words, what this means is members of the deep state, that upper echelon that we talk about, Clinton sycophants, they were literally flooding the FBI with lies, unverified, uncorroborated anti-Trump material. And there's more. Remember the love birds, Strzok and Page? John Solomon, tonight, has uncovered a series of new text from these two anti-Trump FBI officials that show the Obama administration was likely involved in steering this investigation against the Trump campaign, including one text that took place as the FBI was opening their investigation into so-called Russian meddling. Where Lisa Page writes, quote, \"We're not going to withstand the pressure soon.\" And then Page and Strzok also expressing fears that Obama would, quote, \"hijack their investigation or leak details to the press.\" And in another text from Peter Strzok, he indicated that the Obama administration was very much involved in the FBI investigation, writing, quote, \"The White House\" -- meaning the Obama White House -- \"is running this.\" So what did Obama know? When did he know it? When did his inner circle know? When did they know it? It is now time to put the former president and his entire team under oath. Sara Carter, also tonight, another new report and bombshell detailing the possible connection between an international spying alliance called the Five Eyes. You can't put this in a novel. And the rampant surveillance of the Trump campaign. It's even bigger than we thought. After all that Solomon and Carter reported, the investigation into Trump/Russia collusion, remember, it originated abroad in London. Now the United Kingdom is a key member of this Five Eyes alliance. And despite all of this, you have the lunatic, former Communist, former CIA director for Obama, John Brennan, now calling Trump paranoid for expressing concerns over deep state spying. We already know it's true. How could it be paranoid. Sounds like he's very defensive. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: I think Mr. Trump has demonstrated a paranoia an insecurity as well as a real concern about the investigation that is under way. Certainly, his tweets do not seem like they are coming from a person of innocence and confidence. Mr. Trump is going to promote his narrative. He certainly is going to continue to try to discredit the FBI and the CIA and others. But make no mistake about it, the American justice system I think is going to prevail in this endeavor to get to the bottom of who might have been collaborating and working with foreign actors to try to undermine the integrity of the election. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Remember, this is the same John Brennan who went on national TV a few months ago and told the world that Donald Trump should be very, very worried. Sounds like a deep state threat. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: I think he is afraid of the president of Russia. UNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR: Why? BRENNAN: Well, I think one can speculate as to why. That the Russians may have something on him personally that they could always roll out and make his life more difficult. Clearly, I think it is important for us to be able to improve relations with Russia. But the fact that he has had this fawning attitude towards Mr. Putin, has not said anything negative about him continues to say to me that he does have something to fear. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Putting John Brennan's blind contempt and hatred for President Trump aside, we have even more revelations to bring you showing that the deep state is starting to crack. According to a new report, the Wall Street Journal's Kim Strassel, there are serious issues with the FBI's, quote, \"Papadopoulos,\" who no one ever heard of -- and that narrative after the alleged informant indicates, publicly contradicted the FBI's own claims that the one-time low-level Trump advisor discussed the hacked Democratic emails. Remember, the now infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr, a Russian lawyer, a Russian-American lobbyist and a few others, oh, we have new information. Recently unearthed, a transcript from a 2017 Senate hearing that the Russian-American lobbyist admitted to personally knowing Hillary Clinton and some of the people who worked in her campaign. So what was someone who knew Hillary Clinton doing in that meeting? Is the media going to report on that? It is unbelievable. It gets more insane every day. We'll have more on this also later in the show. Also tonight, let's turn to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein. You know, the guy that said Comey should be fired. The guy that signed the last FISA warrant based on the phony dossier that Clinton bought and paid for. A foreign agent put together, funneling money through a law firm and to GPS and then to the foreign agent. Russian lies, Russian government lies to manipulate you, the American people. Last night, we showed you how Rosenstein's clear conflicts of interest surrounding this ongoing Russia probe specifically. His key role in firing Comey, he is witness A in that whole investigation. And he's the one that appointed Mueller. Now finally, people in D.C. are getting what we have been telling you. There are growing calls tonight for Rod Rosenstein to recuse himself. That includes Senator Lindsay Graham. Welcome aboard, Senator. He is asking three very important questions. Quote, \"Do you consider yourself a potential witness in the Mueller investigation regarding the firing of Director Comey by President Trump? If not, why not? He recommended it. Yes, he is a witness. And if so, by the way, you should recuse yourself from further interactions with oversight of the Mueller investigation.\" Thankfully, finally, someone saying what we have been saying and calling for over and over for months. The deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, it's time for you to answer those questions. We know the answers. And then recuse yourself and get out of the way. Because you are the most conflicted person in all of this. Not the Attorney General Jeff Sessions. And by the way, great news for me tonight. Pay close attention. Remember when Senator Chuck Schumer said that you better not mess with the Intel Community because they will get you six ways to Sunday? This is great news for me. Best-selling author, Jerome Corsi, he's the author of this book out now in book stores, on Amazon.com, Barnes&Noble.com. It's called \"Killing the Deep State.\" You might remember him. He was back -- remember, the group against John Kerry, Vietnam Vets for Truth? He was one of them. He's saying that yours truly, that I, Sean Hannity, am the next target of the deep state. Wow. Isn't it so great to know that these corrupt officials with their backs against the wall that are desperate people, who desperate things, and people that have the most powerful tools of intelligence, are now going after me? OK. Really? So sadly, after all we have learned, now we have Jerome Corsi's prediction. It doesn't surprise me. Isn't that sad? Are we the United States of America, or are we going to be the former Soviet Union or are we going to be Venezuela? I promise you this one thing, I'm never stopping ever. Here to help break down this damming new report, is \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. John, good to see you, sir. JOHN SOLOMON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL VIDEO, THE HILL: Good to see you. HANNITY: Quick question. Do you think that Corsi could be right? SOLOMON: I don't know. I hope not. I hope that people stay within the law at all times. Right? You don't want to see -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Haven't you been told by people that you, certain things were happening to you? SOLOMON: There are times people have raised questions about reporters like myself surveilled. And in the past, the FBI did illegally intercept my mail 10 years ago. There's a public record of the FBI apologizing to me for taking my mail after I broke all the stories about what the FBI knew before 9/11. HANNITY: Yes. That's pretty scary. Again, if that is the case, if people who are trying to get to the truth and exposing corruption then become targets of the deep state and those that have these tools of intelligence, you can say good-bye to the Constitution. It doesn't exist. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: And by the way -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: -- you might have been unmasked, right? SOLOMON: Don't know. I don't have evidence of it. And I try -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: You've been told it. SOLOMON: Yes, I got a report. HANNITY: \"London Bridge is falling down, curious origins of FBI's Trump Russia probe.\" This is it huge, including the new Strzok/Page memos that you've discovered. Let's talk about it all. SOLOMON: Yes. It's a great question. Whenever something is going on in Washington and people say there's no political pressure, I just don't believe it. There's it always political pressure in Washington when there's something as big as a hot football like the Russian election investigation. These text messages are the first to really get at the idea that FBI agents felt political pressure, they were worrying that -- they used an expletive to describe their brethren at the Obama Justice Department, might be leaking. And probably the most seminal, most important text message that raised a lot of concern with the people I talked to, a declaration after a meeting at the FBI on August 5th, that the Obama White House, quote, \"is running this thing.\" We don't know what that means yet except that you can interpret that the FBI agents had some fear that the White House would somehow become involved in the Russian case. And that's the first word that we've seen in a documentary -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: John, what you are saying here, and if we look at the face of the Strzok/Page text here, they are pinning this whole thing on the Obama White House, that the Obama White House is running. Now if -- (CROSSTALK) SOLOMON: They certainly had that fear. HANNITY: What is that? SOLOMON: They had that fear. They feared at this moment that this was about to be politically high jacked, either by the CIA, the Justice Department or the White House run by Barack Obama and -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: But that's part of it. Don't they, at one point, say it's being run? My interpretation is they are saying it is being run there. SOLOMON: Someone said in a meeting that they went to that the White House is now running this. That's right. That's what they came back and said in the text message. HANNITY: So I guess at this particular point, we go back to a big problem we have and that is that the Department of Justice, Rod Rosenstein, in particular, and others, they have been obstructing and stonewalling. We have separation of powers, co-equal branches of government. We have a constitutional role for Congress, which is oversight. And guess what? They are preventing them from doing their job. Knowing what you know, if we get that information, how devastating is it for them? SOLOMON: There's a very important person quoted in my latest column, and that is the former head of intelligence for the FBI, ironically, under Robert Mueller, who said, from what he had seen and the stuff I talked to him about and what he's seen on his own, that Congress has legitimate serious questions that should be answered by the Justice Department. This evidence that we have now, these new e-mails showing that the people who became the informers and informants, college professors and ambassadors and opposition researchers for Hillary Clinton, were making contacts with the Trump administration long before there was a predicated investigation. The rules say no source activity until you have a predicated investigation. These e-mails suggest that there were some source activity and some targeting going on. And if Bob Mueller's former intelligence chief said it raises questions, I think we should listen to him. HANNITY: John Solomon, thank you. Huge breaking news tonight. And we'll stay on the story and we'll get back to it next week. I promise. We will follow the bouncing ball here, something that the media can't do. We have more breaking news tonight. Her brand-new column, her brand-new report, investigative reporter, Fox News contributor, Sara Carter. Sara, let's get into yours. And it is it very clear. This is it a big story also. And you are corroborating and confirming a lot of John's story. SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. I think what we see before the FBI actually opened its official investigation, it was a counterintelligence investigation, which means they were gathering as much information as possible from everywhere. And they could. They actually -- and I am not talking about just the bureau. I am talking about other agencies, foreign intelligence, Britain, Germany, Estonia, Poland. We are a member of the Five Eyes. And that doesn't include Germany and -- HANNITY: What you mean by Five Eyes? CARTER: OK. There's Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and Great Britain, and we share information with one another. If we have information pertinent to the United States, we share it. Remember, with Alexander Downer, the ambassador who shared the information with the United States on his conversation of Papadopoulos. HANNITY: But wait. We've got to remind people. Downer donated $25 million to the Clinton Foundation, OK? CARTER: Absolutely. Absolutely. HANNITY: And remember, before the FBI interviewed him, the State Department had to get involved. That means John Kerry knows about it, too. And that goes back to John's report, it goes to the White House and also to the secretary of state's office. CARTER: We have to ask ourselves, Sean, what information are we trading back and forth? This ultimately means that Brennan, who was head of the CIA, and DNI Clapper, director of National Intelligence, would be well aware of this. This is counterintelligence investigation involving something very specific, involving the Trump campaign, Trump campaign members. That's very important. That doesn't mean that this will just be at a lower level. This would be at a higher level, a principle level, which means that Brennan was very well aware of what was going on. And what I'd like to know is, did the British share the information with us first on some of these players or did we ask for specific information. HANNITY: But this is -- CARTER: How was the exchange? HANNITY: Yes. And this is important because all of these foreign players are involved. The time line is way off in story, the narrative that they've been saying. That means that people have been lying dramatically here. And then we have an I.G. report coming out and I'm told as many as 28 people that have knowledge of the Clinton e-mail server scandal, 28 of them, FBI people, want to be subpoenaed so they can tell the story about corruption at the highest levels of the bureau that they love CARTER: Absolutely. There's a lot of FBI agents that want to come out and speak. A lot of them are current agents, which makes it difficult for them. So they need to be subpoenaed. These are things that Congress needs to act on, Congress needs to do so they can come out and tell their stories. HANNITY: Unbelievable reporting. Thank you, Sara Carter. You just keep breaking story after story. We'll stay on this. It is get interesting. When we come back, we'll get legal analysis. Gregg Jarrett, David Limbaugh on this big breaking news night. And the Korean summit is on. And great economic news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Joining us now more reaction to tonight's opening monologue, we have attorney, David Limbaugh. Full disclosure, even though I said it a thousand times, David has done all of my contracts in radio and TV. Also the author of the soon-to-be number-one New York Times bestseller, \"The Russian Hoax, The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\" FOX News analyst, Gregg Jarrett. Let me begin with you, Gregg. When I hear John Solomon say what he said in the last segment, and Sara Carter, what she is reporting tonight, the idea that we have new text messages. You are aware of it. You had it last night, as I did. We were not fully able to go full bore. That in fact this goes to the Obama White House that they are running the operation. What should happen? GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: It is obvious that the CIA director, John Brennan, James Clapper, the DNI, and the Obama White House and likely the president himself were all in on this. Brennan was the instigator of a hoax. He grabbed ahold of fictitious anti-Trump dossier and he ran with it, propagating it on Capitol Hill, trying to damage Candidate Trump and then they're after -- you know, trying to destroy his presidency. And whenever he shows up on television, as he did yesterday, bashing Trump, he only reinforces the notion that he was the guy with the most to gain. He wanted to perpetuate his own power. HANNITY: Wasn't he also a Communist? JARRETT: Pardon me? (CROSSTALK) JARRETT: Oh, yes. HANNITY: How did he become the CIA director and -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: A communist as CIA director is a little dangerous? Yes, let me go to the whole issue, the whole narrative, David Limbaugh, was about Papadopoulos and Downer getting drunk together, as Gregg said, the first time. Four-way hearsay. And we know Downer, they had to thread a needle. The Kerry State Department involved, so that means, again, the time line is off. The whole story is crumbling. It began a lot earlier. But Downer is also a guy that donated $25 million to the Clinton Foundation. We have huge conflicts again here. DAVID LIMBAUGH, ATTORNEY: Yes. And there's a suspicious amount of Clinton involvement in all this supposedly neutral FBI investigation. Not only was Downer, had he donated $25 million to the Clinton Foundation. This Russian lobbyist in the Trump Tower meeting had Clinton ties. Back to your point about the Obama involvement, you know, why is it so hard to believe about Obama, who was willing to weaponize and politicize the IRS and EPA, that he would do so with the DOJ and FBI? Strzok and Page, we know from the texts, feared Obama wanted to highjack the campaign. We know from -- I mean, the investigation. We know from previous texts that he wanted to know everything. They were worried about him being soft on Russia, which is very ironic, throughout all this. And we now have FBI agents, according to Sara Carter, who want to come forward and tell on the record some of the improprieties. (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: There is no way - and I think HANNITY: Go ahead, finish. Yes, sir? LIMBAUGHT: I don't think there's any way that Trey Gowdy is right about this. If he were right about this -- and I have a lot of respect for him -- there would not have been such an effort to protect Hillary Clinton. If it was neutral spying, they would have issued a protective briefing to Donald Trump. (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: And he would have known a lot more about it. (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: All they had to do was go to Trump. HANNITY: This is what makes it all so sinister in its starting earlier. The time line is off, Gregg. They changed the rules, the Obama administration. Remember, they shared intel with agencies, 16 or 17 of them, which they had never done before. And the whole Papadopoulos issue is just blown out of the water. JARRETT: Yes, the FBI, with the help of a complicit New York Times perpetuated this myth that it was Papadopoulos. That's an out-right lie. They're trying to conceal the truth. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Yes - (CROSSTALK) LIMBAUGH: Why did they lie about -- HANNITY: Yes. Last word, David. LIMBAUGH: Why did they lie about Papadopoulos having e-mails when all he said was he heard they had dirt on him. Why all these suspicious lies if they weren't trying to set up Trump? HANNITY: It's all falling apart. It's all falling apart. This story is a blockbuster. We have a lot more coming up. All right. Also, we got the North Korean summit going on. And great news on the economy, the deep state crumbling and outrage tonight all these people on the left, their vial comments Samantha Bee about Ivanka Trump. We got Geraldo Rivera, and much more. Say with us and the latest about North Korea. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from American news headquarters. I'm Trace Gallagher. We are learning new information tonight about President Trump's decision to launch those air strikes against Syria in April. The Justice Department is advising the president the strikes on three military sites in Syria was legal. The government lawyers concluded that president has, quote, \"recently determined that the air strikes were in the national interest and that would not constitute war.\" That's base on information from a report released earlier today. And there may soon be a summit between President Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin. The Wall Street Journal reporting that the White House is planning on the meeting to ease growing tensions between the two nations. The proposed summit is in the early stages and would likely focus on Syria, nuclear arms control and Ukraine. The nation must agree on a location and a date. If news breaks out, we'll break in. I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to Sean Hannity. HANNITY: All right. So liberal TV host Samantha Bee on Wednesday night launched a vile disgusting vicious attack against Ivanka Trump. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAMANTHA BEE, HOST, TBS: Ivanka Trump who works at the White House just to post the second most oblivious tweet we've seen this week. You know, Ivanka, that's a beautiful photo of you and your child. But let me say one mother to another, do something about your dad's immigration practice as you feckless (muted). (CROWD CHEERING) BEE: He listens to you. Put something on something tight and low cut and tell your father to (muted) stop it. And tell him it was an Obama thing and see how it goes. OK? (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now although both TBS and Samantha Bee have apologized she is facing a major backlash from critics who see a double standard in the wake how Roseanne Barr was treated and so many others have treated. And we talked a lot about this earlier in the week. Even the president weighed in on the controversy tweeting out, \"Why aren't they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on a low rating show. A total double standard but that's OK. We're winning and we'll be doing so for a long time to come. However, some on the left are sticking up and even trying to protect her.  Look, the television academy reported blocked the media from attending an event last night where she was honored last night. And meanwhile, speaking of double standards, well, CNN grand stander Jim Acosta keeps proving his anti-Trump bias. Listen to what he said about President Trump's meeting with Kim Kardashian on prison reform this week. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM ACOSTA, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Forget about the fact that Kim Kardashian is here at the White House today and what planet that is anything resembling normal because it's not. She shouldn't be here talking about prison reform. It's very nice that she is here, but that's not a serious thing to have happened here at the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Actually if you read the case it's actually a really serious matter. And Acosta, by the way, saying a very different tune while covering the singer John Legend's activism on prison reform when Barack Obama was president. Real consistency, Jim Acosta. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN LEGEND, SINGER: I'm going to push the president to get more involved in the criminal justice reform. I'm going to suggest some ideas that we think could help improve the situation. ACOSTA: If you change your mind about running for office, give CNN the scoop. LEGEND: I will. I will. ACOSTA: John Legend-- LEGEND: Don't hold your breath. ACOSTA: Don't hold your breath. We might just a little bit. But John Legend, thank you very much. Great talking with you. LEGEND: Thank you. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. Here with reaction former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, author of the Geraldo Show, Fox News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera, and South Carolina Republican Governor Henry McMaster is with us. Geraldo, let me start with you. Because this is really interesting, if you look at the case in particular, this was a first offense, and lifetime sentence for a woman who had a lot of permanent problems, needed money and got involved in drugs. I actually think the case that Kim Kardashian was pushing was a powerful one and we really need to pay attention to. GERALDO RIVERA, CORRESPONDENT AT LARGE, FOX NEWS: I think there's no doubt that Kim Kardashian's appearance at the White House was totally appropriate. I mean, Sean Spicer can answer that a lot better than I. But it just seem to me that she was really bringing attention to a very necessary issue, one the White House is now been grappling with, thanks to this new legislation on sentencing reform and so forth. And a lifetime sentence and no parole, no possibility of parole, she didn't murder anybody. So I really do think that Kim Kardashian's visit to the White House was absolutely appropriate. Samantha Bee, you know, the hypocrisy on he left. I mean, we should be outrage by both Roseanne Barr and Samantha Bee and I think that just very briefly what we should do is let the victims of their insults tell us what to do. Valerie Jarrett has responded very graciously to Roseanne Barr. Ivanka Trump has been beyond gracious when it comes to Samantha Bee. Maybe when they grabble and they beg forgiveness maybe we give forgiveness, Sean. That is a Christian view. HANNITY: Sean, what is your take? Go ahead. SEAN SPICER, FORMER UNITED STATES WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Let me show you my shock face. Because I think in both of these circumstances there is nothing that, you know, that shocks me. Because, one is, the idea that Jim Acosta is deciding what's an appropriate issue to be discussed at the White House. And just put the merit of the case aside, I think Geraldo valiantly displayed what they are. But the bottom line is it's not up to the media. Never mind Jim Acosta to decide what's a valid issue to be discussed or not. It's up to the president of the United States and other elected and government officials to decide what issues are going to be addressed the concerns that the American people have. And every American has the right to decide what issues are important to them and to advocate their government to support them one way or the other. The idea by the way, on the other piece on Samantha Bee, look, I believe, I made a lot of mistakes in the White House that I asked for forgiveness for and I think people were very gracious in many cases-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: With all due respect, stop bothering yourself, you did not make that many mistakes. SPICER: Well, thank you. Thank you, but my point is this. I think that when people screw up and they apologize just give them forgiveness. I think that -- but the double standard that exists whether Samantha Bee or Joan Reid or Joy Reid. These other people when they make a mistake, the left absolves them and doesn't, you know, sort of excuses them and explains why what they said wasn't that bad and that there are no consequences. But I agree with Geraldo, again-- (CROSSTALK) RIVERA: The thing is-- SPICER: Let me -- Ivanka has been so unbelievably graceful about this. And this isn't the first time. If you remember Julia Ioffe, the former Politico reporter now with The Atlantic said a very similar thing. And what was the thing then? Well, she didn't really mean it? HANNITY: Yes. SPICER: So these disgusting and reprehensible tactics by so-called journalist and people on the left getting excused and washed away every single time. HANNITY: Look, and Henry, by the way, good luck in your run for governor in South Carolina. HENRY MCMASTER, GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA: Thank you. HANNITY: I was down there recently, a beautiful state and I have a lot of friends down there. MCMASTER: Yes. HANNITY: You know, I look at this and I'm like, OK, this is now an environment. I read everybody's apologies. And I give Roseanne, I mean, she's apologized again and again and I sense that there is real sincerity here. It was a 2.45 a.m. tweet and not a good thing and I have my suspicions what, you know, what happens. Geraldo knows a thing or two about tweeting RIVERA: I know very well. Very well. No tweeting after midnight. HANNITY: But what about the point everybody wants to silence voices they don't agree with. I have never called for the cancelling of any show, the firing of any host. Bill Maher going back to politically incorrect on ABC whose people like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh that said, you know what, don't fire them. MCMASTER: Sean, these people are just, I think they've gone crazy. President Trump is enormously powerful here. If he run today he would get more votes than he got when he start in opposition the last time. But his tweet was exactly right. He is saying what everybody in South Carolina is thinking. He's 100 percent right. I just don't know what happened to these people on the left. I don't know if this hatred of the president or the hatred of what he stands for which is what America stands for. I think something happened to these people and they are making fools of themselves. I think they are so deep in the tank they don't realize it and shoot. And they will apologize until the next time and then the next time and I think people have just had enough of it. HANNITY: But you know, and Geraldo, this is a point that I always go back. As much as I'd like to make everybody in American to watch the show I have to do a show and invite them into -- invite me into their home, if you will, and that's how you gain an audience. And I think the American people are smart. We saw them short, you know, we feel that we have to silence. Go ahead. RIVERA: Well, in that regard, I just want to say referencing something, Sean, you said at the beginning of this program this evening about the deep state coming to you. If they come for you they are going to have to come through me. Because I'm going to be-- HANNITY: Wow. RIVERA: I'm going to be there, you know, fighting off these people. HANNITY: If have Geraldo in my bunker, I'm safe. There's no-- (CROSSTALK) RIVERA: I wonder what happened to the level of civility. I mean, it is so-- HANNITY: Right. RIVERA: --low down and dirty now. It' a -- you know, the candidate for governor in the great state of South Carolina alluded to it. I think that there is really been, you know, the country is so divided and the people who hate the president hate him with such vehemence with such wherever they get this. I mean, do they really get this way-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: You see, you want him succeed. RIVERA: And you are others that are really criminals. HANNITY: But you know, understand if he's successful with the economy. Look at these numbers. He is successful in North Korea, he's keeping his promises we're becoming energy independent, the biggest tax cut. That's bad news for Democrats, Geraldo. They want to win in 2018 and for them to win he's got to fail. RIVERA: Well, I think that that is melancholy that they root against their own country to -- for partisan purposes. You know-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Let me get Sean for the last word. Go ahead, Sean. SPICER: I would just say the one thing about the Samantha Bee thing that troubles me more than anything, it was pre-taped. They thought about it, they scripted it and still went ahead of it. That's vastly different than making a really sort of put, you know, stepping in it without thinking about it. So I really think this case is different than a lot of the other ones. HANNITY: All right. Good to see you. And Henry McMaster, by the way, welcome to the program and good luck on your run down there in South Carolina. We wish you the best. (CROSSTALK) MCMASTER: Thank you, Sean. HANNITY: When we come back, we'll talk about historic meeting, this is history in the making. The summit is back on. Great news for the world. Listen, the president said it may take two or three meetings. Let's see. We'll tell you all about it. We'll get the latest from the White House when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to meet June 12, it will be in Singapore. It will be a beginning. I don't say and I've never said it happens in one meeting, you're talking about years of hostility, years of problems. Years of really hatred between so many different nations. But I think you're going to have a very positive result in the end. Not from one meeting. I think it's going to be a process that we deserve to have. I mean, we really deserve. They want it. We think it's important. And I think we would be making a big mistake if we didn't have it. I think we're going to have a relationship and it will start on June 12th. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: History in the making. The president earlier today announcing his upcoming summit with Kim Jong-un. It is back on June the 12th in Singapore. And the president's remarks came after a two-hour meeting in the Oval Office, with the number two most powerful man in North Korea. Joining us now with reaction in all of this, former deputy assistant to the president, Fox News national strategist, Dr. Sebastien Gorka, retired CIA senior intelligence officer and Fox News contributor, Daniel Hoffman. You know, we -- it's amazing to me that the president pulls out seconds -- it's like within 24 hours, no, no, we didn't mean what we said. We got a missile-launching site being dismantled, Kim crossing the DMZ, the first time in 18 years a high ranking official in the United States, we got the hostages released and no missiles are being fired over Japan or no threats to the world at this moment, Dr. Gorka, and he didn't pay a dime. It's remarkable. SEBASTIAN GORKA, NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST, FOX NEWS: Yes. Let alone, billions of dollars. If this -- imagine if this had happened anytime in the last 25 years, whether it was Republican administration, or Democrat one. If a summit had been canceled, the normal diplomatic protocols would have meant that it maybe would have happened a year from now. Or 18 months from now. HANNITY: Good point. GORKA: The president cancels it. He has a very hard letter, he plays hard ball, but he leaves that last paragraph open saying this is so important to both of our countries. If you want to go ahead with it, send me a letter, give me a call. What happens, within hours, a couple of days later, that letter is hand delivered to the Oval Office. It's a different way of doing politics. HANNITY: Yes. GORKA: It's a different way of doing diplomacy, and it gets results. HANNITY: And I'm very impressed with Secretary of State Pompeo, I really am. I think he's been amazing, an amazing addition to the president. GORKA: Yes. HANNITY: You know, Daniel, we were discussing this and I think the president -- you were concerned going back a few weeks that you wanted to make sure the president didn't overpromise, under deliver, although we've already gotten a lot out of North Korea in a good way. And the president was very clear, this is a process, nothing will be signed on June the 12th, that it may take, it would be great if it was one meeting, it would be great if this happens, but it may not, and may take one, two, three, four meetings, they can go as fast or slow as they want. DANIEL HOFFMAN, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS: Right. I was a little concerned at the beginning. And I think our citizens might have expected immediate results. This is an extraordinary difficult challenge for us. But what I would really highlight is today's meeting, which was just so valuable for us, Secretary Pompeo had met twice with Kim Yong Chol, the North Korea's former chief of military intelligence and the guy has been responsible for their nuclear negotiations. You're right. He's Kim Jong Un's right hand man. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: What do you know about him? HOFFMAN: Well, he's a four-star general, he was a former bodyguard to Kim Jong-un's family, he's extraordinarily well-trusted. And what Secretary Pompeo did today was essentially a warm turnover to the president. And these relationships matter. This is what we base our productive negotiations on, these sorts of high-level relationships-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: You know, you're right. HOFFMAN: -- on which we can build for-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: And Daniel, as you're speaking, remember, I was watching this live today, if we can keep that up on the screen what we were just showing, that's the president literally walking him out to his car. You could read how friendly this all was. You could see, you know, it was supposed to be handled with a letter and leave as the president said, but it ended up being a two-hour meeting. It sounds a lot like what the meetings had -- what the meetings were scheduled with the president of China started out as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, half hour, they go on for four hours. HOFFMAN: Right. HANNITY: So clearly there's something going on here. HOFFMAN: And tactically, it makes so much sense. You know, we relied in the past on six-party talks. Two of those parties Russia and China do not have our best interests at heart. And what we're seeing right now is the president expertly mounting an effective diplomatic charge at North Korea, with showing our strength, and at the same time being open to negotiation. We saw it playing out today in full force. HANNITY: Yes, as you were watching this unfold today, Dr. Gorka, I mean, I'm just curious, because you know this president so well, and so many Americans, especially those in the left and in the media do not understand he is the negotiator. GORKA: He is. He is a people person. Read the book \"The Art of the Deal.\" The first chapter is a day in the life of Donald Trump. And in it he's constantly meeting people. They count the number, he makes 40 phone calls in that day, as he's building his empire. It's always about results. And then it was about building Trump international. Now it's about getting America back on track. And in the last year and a half, he's been crushing it. HANNITY: All right. Guys, really good to see you. I appreciate it. Amazing, economy is great, North Korea is back on. And the deep state is crumbling. Good news. We'll continue right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Unfortunately that's all the time we have left. Think about it, great news on the economy, North Korean summit is back on, and huge stories. Yes, this deep state now getting to the Obama White House. We have a lot more on Monday. But in the meantime, we hope you have a great weekend. Let not your heart be troubled. The news continues. Laura Ingraham is next. We'll always be fair and balanced. We're not the destroy-Trump media. See you on Monday. END Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" September 7, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi everyone, I'm Laura Ingraham and welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle.\" We have a really special show for you tonight. The first ever \"Ingraham Angle\" town hall. Now, last week I went to Chicago to discover the reason for the staggering levels of violence. Violence destroying the south and west sides of the windy city. And I wanted to expose the city's impotent political response to it. So we spoke to victims, politicians, religious leaders, all of whom who are on the ground. What they have to say is going to shock you. But these voices need to be heard. Now, we learned this week that Chicago's Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel, will not be seeking a third term. Now, one can only hope that a new mayor will bring peace and some healing to a city in desperate need of both. Here's our town hall from Chicago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (APPLAUSE) INGRAHAM: Good evening everyone, I'm Laura Ingraham and welcome to the first ever INGRAHAM ANGLE town hall. Now, first I'd like to thank the city of Chicago and our audience here for hosting us for an incredibly important discussion. Chicago is one of the truly great American cities, spectacularly beautiful in the summer and winter. But in recent years, its gang violence problem has reached epidemic proportions, a level of violence just unacceptable for anywhere in America. The city is on pace for more than 2,000 shootings this year, which will mark the fifth straight year it's topped that grim mark. And just so you get some perspective, since 2011, the year that Rahm Emanuel took office as mayor, there have been over 4,000 murders in this city. That's more than the 3,481 soldiers who were killed in action in operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2010, if you can believe it. And it's not just the level of violence in the city that's the problem. It's the lack of justice. According to an analysis conducted by the \"Washington Post,\" Chicago police have made an arrest in only about 27 percent of homicides since 2010. That's the lowest rate of any city \"The Post\" examined. For non-fatal shootings, it's even worse. The University of Chicago Crime Lab tells us just 10 percent of shootings resulted in arrests in 2014. And by 2016, the latest year available, that number had dropped to just five percent The unsolved crimes undoubtedly fuel a vicious cycle of distrust between law enforcement and community. And no one is immune from this violence. Throughout the hour, we're going to talk to members of law enforcement, community activists, religious and political leaders, as well as members of the audience, to try to figure out why this tragedy is unfolding in Chicago and how to stop it. Let's get started tonight with Anthony Napolitano. He's a former police officer and the sole Republican in Chicago's 50-seat city council. Martin Prieb, who is a member of Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police, and Kevin Graham, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Chicago Lodge 7. Anthony, let's start with you. This is so both heartbreaking and infuriating. We have a world of violence across the globe. Heart breaking stories every day, but as Americans, I can't imagine we find this level of violence in a city as spectacular as Chicago, with its rich history, acceptable. What do we do? ANTHONY NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: The biggest problem I think right now in the city of Chicago is they're not breaking it down into three different groups of what's plaguing our city. You got an incredible amount of narcotics that come through the city of Chicago. You got an enormous amount of guns on the street that last year alone or (inaudible) 2018 alone, almost 5,200 guns have been recovered. We have a sale of stolen merchandise there part of a criminal element on the street that it's just -- it's a multimillion dollar industry. So you don't just have gang-bangers running around shooting each other. This is a fight over territory. This is a fight over who's making money on the street right now. And if you can't get to the streets and say, hey, you got to stop the narcotics that are coming in the boat loads and we have to get more guns off the streets, then we have to realize that the criminal element is using the streets to sell stolen merchandise, we'll never going to get ahead of this problem. I mean, your number was actually wrong. We had -- we're over the 2,000 mark of people shot in the city of Chicago already and we have 375 homicides. So we have surpassed the number of people shot. I always say if you imagine how many of them missed. INGRAHAM: Kevin, the police have had their hands full, that's for sure. It's the level of violence. But you see the number of murders solved, suspects arrested and it's a pretty small percentage compared to other cities, as you saw in that analysis. Why? KEVIN GRAHAM, PRESIDENT, FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE: Well, there's a couple of reasons. The first reason is, first of all, we have had 2,025 shootings in the city up to date as of today. First of all, it didn't start yesterday. It started several years ago when they decided to under fund and underman the police department. We have -- we are still almost 1,000 policemen short where we need to be. INGRAHAM: Rght, hold on. Everyone is going -- you're 1,000 police officers short in the city of Chicago today? GRAHAM: We only have half of the detectives that we need. We used to have 2,000 detectives. INGRAHAM: How many do you have now? GRAHAM: Just about 1,000. INGRAHAM: What's the reason for that? What are the politicians saying? GRAHAM: You're going to have to ask the mayor, Rahm Emanuel, for that answer. You know, he's the one that calls three police stations. He's the one that calls two detective areas. We didn't do that. We have always at the FOP tried to interject our solutions to the problem, but when it requires money, we are shut out. Our opinion doesn't count. That's part of the problem. And that's what has to change. We certainly want to go out there and do the job that we were hired to do, but because they have decided to have more police oversight, they've accepted the ACLU and their long stop carts because they have decided that we're going to work 12 hour days. We're not going to allow people time off. That all wears on police officers and that is what has contributed to the problems in this city. INGRAHAM: Let's now go to Melanie Brown, who prefers not to reveal her political party. Melanie, welcome. MELANIE BROWN, CITIZEN OF CHICAGO: Thank you for having me. All right. So we know that all police aren't bad. You know? But when some of the police officers hurt our community, then we feel like some of the other police officers should come together and try to help the community because they should care about what the community thinks about the police department. So, I just wonder, whatever happened to the good cop/bad cop, you know, where there's one group of police officers we might be afraid of, but then there's the good cop where they can share, you know, who is murdered, what's the crime or anything like that and we can get more, you know, crime solved for our community and to help everyone. INGRAHAM: Going back to the issue of trust. BROWN: Yes. INGRAHAM: Trust between the community and law enforcement. Law enforcement is supposed to keep people safe. When you call the police, you want to have that level of trust and the police want you to trust them, otherwise they're not able to do their job either. Martin? MARTIN PRIEB, MEMBER, FRATERNAL OF POLICE: As a writer in the group, I would answer that by pointing to one statistic. The city of Chicago has paid over $700 million in police misconduct cases. And many of these cases, these claims against the police are bogus. And they're used to push this narrative of police corruption that is quite often fraudulent. And the city pays out on these and creates this industry of suing police officers that, in turn, lends itself to more police oversight. And even good police officers and I believe the overwhelming majority of them are good, I think when officers do something wrong, it's generally it's a mistake. But all officers now in Chicago face an absolutely ludicrous level of oversight and potential lawsuits and criminal charges by a prosecutor that is clearly anti-police. And so this is one of the reasons that the police are unable to do the kind of effective police work that they want to do. Policing is an art and the city has now set up in so many levels -- INGRAHAM: Give us some examples. So, let's say when you brandish your firearm for any particular reason, do you have to write a report on every time you brandish your firearm? GRAHAM: Not yet, but that's what they're trying. INGRAHAM: That's what Rahm Emanue wants. GRAHAM: Let me go back to one of our officers, they were trying to find that he had done something wrong. It was the FOP that dug our heels in and found out that what was going on (inaudible) was, they were trying to hold secret investigations and not divulge the outcome of those to the officer which cleared him. They wanted to make sure that officers were found guilty. That's unacceptable. I don't care if it's a citizen, that there's a secret investigation going on or it's a police officer. People need to be treated fairly. And unfortunately, police officers are not treated fairly. INGRAHAM: So you think it's accusation against the police officer they are presumed guilty by the community? So there's distrust between the community and police. Police don't trust the accusations or no? GRAHAM: It is the investigative body. All cases that involve shootings are sent to the federal, to the FBI and to the state's attorney's office for prosecution. INGRAHAM: I think what we're getting at, it's painfully obvious, when you have 1,000 detective deficit on a police force, could be lot of things. Is it money is not allocated? Is it the pay is not enough? Is it demoralized police? Is it too dangerous and people feel like for the risk I'm taking, I'm not getting much of a benefit? You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't. Why am I going to do this job? Policing should be -- it is a noble profession, but Anthony, you hear two police officers that feel like -- oftentimes they feel like they can do no right. But we have concerned citizens who say we need more of a collaboration here. Got to be able to fix this. NAPOLITANO: I love to answer that question. I was a police officer myself. I worked the street. I worked in the 15th district and I was a gang enforcement officer. So, to answer this young lady's question, I have done that job. I have built relationships on the streets with other officers and there was the ability to work crime based off relationships you have, but what's happened is a culture through America now is the police are becoming the enemy. The neighborhoods are kind of closing their doors and don't want to answer the police. INGRAHAM: Don't be a snitch. NAPOLITANO: Don't be a snitch because snitches get stitches, and that's the concept on the street. INGRAHAM: But I have seen that t-shirt. NAPOLITANO: Yes. And you know what, there's always this concept that there's this thin blue line between officers and they don't talk, the code of silence. That's not even true. The thin blue line is in a certain amount of officers that will take a bullet for each other and protect each other. The bigger line that is harder to cross is in the neighborhoods when nobody wants to talk about what they saw for many reasons. They don't want to get stitches. But it's part of a big element in the neighborhood throughout the whole city where there's a lot of money being made on the street. So you're hurting an enterprise on the street alone. INGRAHAM: Now let's go to Reed Willis, a Republican with a question about federal involvement in Chicago, Reed. REED WILLIS, REPUBLICAN: So my question for the panelists is whether or not they support President Trump's previous calls for the National Guard to be sent here to Chicago? And if so, what would the National Guard be able to do that local police cannot? INGRAHAM: OK, President Trump, you know, mentioned the National Guard in Chicago. It's been thrown around before. GRAHAM: Certainly I believe that any time we have federal agents, federal law enforcement agents, they're welcome. And certainly, I have nothing against federal troops. I'm sure that the president meant that is trying to help the city. I think what we need to do is make sure that politicians realize that they have to spend the money to hire police officers, hire the right police officers, make sure they are trained. Have a facility in which to train them. And then also be out there in the community. We've removed our foot officers through most of the city and we need to put those -- INGRAHAM: Are they shutting down detective offices in these difficult neighborhoods, Anglewood and so forth? I read that, that was another concern by the police. PRIEB: Well, they did -- they have closed some districts and whatnot. That has been the case, but you know, I really couldn't say about the National Guard or, you know. INGRAHAM: To me, it's like, this is a local problem and for the most part it has a local solution. PRIEB: I think it's a bit of a myth though to say that here's complete distrust in communities between the police. There really isn't. There's still a lot of people -- they call us, they rely on us, they want us to help them. You know, a lot of it is gangs. Most of the violence is gang violence and they don't -- INGRAHAM: Fifty-nine major gangs with a lot of off-shoots, 2,400 off- shoots of these gangs and among the most vicious in the country and in the world. Guys, all of you, thank you so much for your input tonight. Chicago's political leadership we just referenced is disastrously failing its residents. One of the men running to turn that around will join us next. (END VIDEOTAPE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: As we mentioned at the top of tonight's show, Chicago Democrat mayor Rahm Emanuel announced this week that he will not be seeking re- election. He made the announcement after we taped this next segment, but we thought it was really important to bring out our full discussion about the political failures in the windy city, which perhaps reveals why Emanuel decided not to pursue a third term. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (APPLAUSE) INGRAHAM: The failure of political leadership in Chicago is just simply profound. Democrats have controlled this city for more than eight decades and the disastrous results are impacting residents every day. Chicago is about six months out from its mayoral election, so naturally we invited Mayor Rahm Emanuel to attend this town hall. But not only did he turn us down his office used some fairly ugly language in their response to us. Well, we think this issue is of critical importance, even if Mayor Emanuel's office does not and does not want to participate. But for more, let's bring in Ja'Mal Green. He's an activist here in Chicago who is running for mayor, Lashawn Ford, a Democrat and member of the Illinois State House of Representatives and DePaul University professor Jason Hill. It's great to see all of you. Professor Hill, I know you study these issues, seemingly intractable issues of recurring cycle of violence. Today, as you see things now, is there hope for this city? JKASON HILL, PROFESSOR, DEPAUL UNIVERSITY: I think there is hope, but I think the hope lies in strong leadership. I think the hope lies in a change in governance. I think we have an incompetent mayor who is recalcitrant. I think corruption and violence are part of the political DNA of the city. INGRAHAM: What does that mean, part of the political DNA? I mean -- HILL: Chicago is the most corrupt city in the United States of America. It has been for a long, long time and there's no getting around that. And we have a mayor who assumed the mayorship and did nothing about it except to look the other way when bribes are being undertaken. And I think that a change of governance is really necessary. I think there are a couple of things that would make this city very, very difficult to attract businesses for example the high crime rate and the city is the number one issue that -- INGRAHAM: The businesses don't want to, you know, move into to south, the west side because look, too much of a risk? I know Whole Foods opened in Anglewood. I ran into a Whole Foods executive on the plane coming here and he's like yes, we open up a store there. It's not easy. It's not easy being in business there but we did it. HILL: Well, we have a population that's beating (ph) Chicago on an unprecedented rate. I mean, we have a high crime rate in the city and -- INGRAHAM: But it's overwhelmingly Democrats. And Representative Ford, I think it's 83 percent of the city voted for Hillary Clinton in the last presidential election. About 12 percent voted for President Trump. They keep voting in the same people. Take the parties out of it for a second. I'd say if it was Republican for 70 years and they were failing. If you have a bad basketball coach who doesn't win, you kick him out and get a new one. So why do we keep returning year after year after year to overwhelming liberal leadership in the city of Chicago when it seems like it's obviously not working for the people who need the most help? LASHAWN FORD, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER, ILLINOIS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE: Well, that's a good question. I'm one vote and my people need help in Chicago. Black people need help if we really want America to be the greatest that it can be. And we need stronger black leaders. We need a black mayor in Chicago. There's no way we're going to be able to deal with the issues in Chicago unless you have a mayor that really understands the critical issues that is impacting the people of Chicago. The black issue is the number one issue in the city of Chicago. And until we have a mayor in this city that understands how to remedy those problems and understands fairness and equity and attacks those problems, we're going to continue to see problems like this. INGRAHAM: I mean, you are basically saying it has to be a black mayor. That's kind of a wild thing to say. I mean, it could be an Asian mayor that comes in and is able to heal wounds and get police together with the community activist or a black or a white or I mean -- FORD: I'm going to say that right now we need a black mayor. I can't back down from that because, you know, the last time we had a black mayor, Harold Washington, things were improving. And white people -- white people are good and I want to work with white people but I think -- INGRAHAM: Well, I'm here. I'm trying to figure it out. I'm trying my best. FORD: I have nothing against white people, but what I do know is that we need to work alongside white people, blacks and whites. No one can really solve black people's problems better than blacks. INGRAHAM: Well Ja'Mal, it could be you. You can be the next mayor. I mean, you're 26, 27? JA'MAL GREEN, ACTIVIST: Twenty-three. INGRAHAM: Twenty-three?! GREEN: Yes, ma'am. INGRAHAM: OK, so you've had your own issue, run-in with the police. I (inaudible) this whole saga. We don't have to go into it. It involved you and getting into a dust up with a police officer and you plead down on misdemeanor. But tell us, you know, you are the next generation. It's you guys who are going to have to solve this problem, so, what to do? GREEN: Well, you're exactly right. You know, I'm from these communities. I understand it. I saw people being shot in front of me as a young kid, you know, hiding behind bushes, hoping that the gun man didn't shoot me. I have seen and experienced these problems first hand. From poverty, from having to light candles because my mom couldn't pay the light bill. And we need someone who has experienced these problems because we understand and have the passion to actually change them when we get into these positions. These are the types of people that care, right, for all issues in the city of Chicago and that's why I'm running for mayor. INGRAHAM: So many young people leave their house in the morning. Not in, you know, fancy areas of Chicago. Not in the rich suburbs so much. But in the neighborhoods that are hurting the most, they don't know if they're coming home. Now, I grew up in a town outside of Hartford, Connecticut and it was very middle class, but I never worried about getting shot when I left the house in the morning. I didn't have a lot of money, but we didn't worry about getting shot. I don't think most people across the country can understand how that feels. And I got to tell you, I think you're right. Until you live that -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There you go. INGRAHAM: (Inaudible), but until you live that fear. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You'll never understand it. INGRAHAM: It is -- I can't put myself in your place. Look, we might not agree on a lot of political issues, but I like the fact that you're getting involved here. By the way, we have a question now from Maze Jackson, political independent. Maze? MAZE JACKSON, INDEPENDENT: So my question is, with violence off -- with violence out of control, with black unemployment the highest in the country, and with blacks leading in the -- last in the economic indicators, will the black community vote for Rahm Emanuel again? GREEN: Well, that's a good question. We saw that in the last election, where, you know, overwhelmingly blacks voted for Rahm Emanuel and put him back in power. I think now, with the (inaudible) cover-up and how he covered up the murder of a 17-year-old who was shot 16 times. That has exposed so many different things going on in the city. INGRAHAM: The case is on going. GREEN: The case is on going, but lot of different police reforms and people like Attorney Madigan stepping up with the consent decree, the CPS, sexual abuse scandal that has been uncovered. INGRAHAM: You heard the police. They feel beleaguered too. I mean they feel-- think about if you had half the number of people trying to teach 2,000 kids in public schools or trying to be a detective on the street, and you're outnumbered and sometimes you're outgunned. So Rahm Emanuel campaigns in the city, right? He goes down to these areas and walks these streets? Do you see him down there? Is he? GREEN: No, I don't. The only thing that he does is -- INGRAHAM: He wouldn't come here tonight. Instead he sent us a nasty note. GREEN: The only thing that he does in our community is he come and dances at CHA festivals. INGRAHAM: What is CHA? GREEN: Chicago Housing Authority. INGRAHAM: OK. GREEN: He just comes and dances and takes pictures and act like he care about -- INGRAHAM: Dances? Oh, because he was a ballet dancer. GREEN: He was a ballet dancer. And that's why he's trying to win back this election, is by dancing. We don't need another dancer. We need solutions on how we're going to solve these problems and I don't think he could do it. INGRAHAM: Professor. HILL: You know, I have written a book called \"We Have Overcome\" and laid (ph) some solutions for what I think are some of the problems in this city. I think parts of the city has to be placed military receivership. INGRAHAM: Military receivership. HILL: That's right. I think -- INGRAHAM: You want uniformed military? HILL: Who is on the ground, National Guard, the Navy? INGRAHAM: Won't that make people feel like they're more under siege or you're saying it will make them feel safer? HILL: It will make them feel safer. INGRAHAM: OK, guys, when we return, religious and civic leaders from Chicago will join us with their plans to help save their city. Don't go away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Welcome back to our town hall from Chicago. And as we discussed in our previous segment, this city's political class has utterly failed its citizens while crime threatens their future. So what are the religious and civic groups doing that politicians apparently can't? Joining us now are Corey Brooks and Ira Acree, who are both pastors, along with Tio Hardiman, executive director of Violence Interrupters and also a professor. It's great to see all of you. Thanks so much for being here tonight. Wonderful city. Love coming here. Always do. Tough problems. Reverend Acree, tell us what your thoughts are. You've heard the conversations both from the police perspective and the political perspective. Again, we invited Rahm Emanuel to come. We really wanted him to come, open to all. Wasn't going to be part of this. No other primetime show is in Chicago doing this show, by the way. Your reaction? REV. IRA ACREE, GREATER ST. JOHN BIBLE CHURCH: I always say if a house is on fire, it's my responsibility to get out of the house. But it's the police, rather the fire department's responsibility to put the fire out, not to come on the scene and lecture. Was somebody playing with matches?  Whose fault is it? No. There's a responsibility that the fire department must do, and that's put out the fire. And that's what we really need. All institutions must put all hands on deck. We certainly need the mayor to lead the way. Right now here in Chicago we have a tale of two cities. We have economic disinvestment on the south side and the west side. On the north side you have economic boom. You have first class schools. On the south side and west side you've got 50 schools that are closed. This anger is fueled from the poverty and the disinvestment, which ultimately leads to the violence. INGRAHAM: It's a cycle, though, is it not, Pastor Brooks? This is a cycle, because when a community becomes dangerous, business doesn't want to go in. And if business doesn't go in, you don't have the opportunity, you don't have the stores. Stores bring a sense of community as well. So with that cycle, which is very depressing to a lot of people, how does the faith community step in and say, guys and gals, there's another way? REV. COREY BROOKS, NEW BEGINNINGS CHURCH OF CHICAGO: Well, we have to do our part. We are constantly always playing the blame game in our community, blaming everybody for our situation. But I really do believe we have to step up to the plate and take responsibility and stop waiting for people to come in an save the day for us. We have to start developing businesses. We have to start training individuals. We have to start making sure we have schools that are properly educating our children in our neighborhood. And then someone has to say to our parents, look, we have to take responsibility for our children. We cannot allow our children to run rampant and unharnessed and not deal with them and discipline them. We have to do a better job in our community making sure that we cover all bases. And we cannot continue to blame anyone for those issues. We have to take advantage and start doing the things for ourselves. (APPLAUSE) INGRAHAM: Personal responsibility. Professor Hardiman, the level of fatherlessness in our society at large crosses all economic spectrums, crosses all racial backgrounds. It especially is difficult in Chicago and especially in the poorest neighborhoods. Young men without role models, mothers doing their very best, working hard. They seek role models in all the wrong places. And the gangs are there to fulfill their roles. What about that, the family part of this equation? TIO HARDIMAN, PROFESSOR IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE: Back in the 1950s 70 percent of African-American households had the fathers in the household. The year 2018, 70 percent of the families do not have the fathers in the household. Black death is a hustle. That's the basic problem of being in Chicago. Every time you have a high level of shootings and homicides, the police have to do overtime. You've got all these community groups, they need millions of dollars. As a matter of fact, Arne Duncan received $130 million. With $130 million I can hire every black man in Chicago for the next 30 years, OK? Black death is a hustle. (APPLAUSE) HARDIMAN: The police have not been trained to stop killers on the front end. Police get involved after the crime has been committed. That's a big elephant in the room nobody wants to talk about. INGRAHAM: How would they do that? HARDIMAN: I would like to propose training the police in the areas of conflict resolution. I can train the police. I am the president of Violence Interrupters Incorporated. I have a proven track record in the area of reducing shootings and homicides in Chicago. INGRAHAM: Across the globe, though. You've actually had incredible success with your program. Early intervention, police are involved. Families have to be involved, too, though. A police officer can't come in and fix the family situation, can maybe help on the margins, though. HARDIMAN: I agree with you. It's incumbent upon the black family to unify. You will not need a program. (APPLAUSE) HARDIMAN: If black people unify, there will be no need for programs. It's incumbent upon us as black men and women to step up to the plate and help save our city. We have a mass exodus of African-American people moving out of Chicago because of the violence and nobody is stepping up because black death is a hustle. Everybody is making money off the crimes in our community and we have to stop it today. ACREE: Here's the thing. When you look at our community, when you see a community struggling like our community is, you have some failure in multiple institutions. Although we have to have personal responsibility, we still have a taxpayer base. We have to have taxpayers that pay taxes, get the responsibility. And we must also get the services that the government is supposed to give. We must have that. When you look at the homicide rate, it's 17 percent for 2017. I'm convinced that it's not an urgency for this administration. When 83 percent of the people who are murdered, people are still running the streets, that's a problem. We need to get these murderers off the streets, and that means increasing the capacity of the detectives unit. There's only 1,100 detectives. In 1990 when we had 2,000 detective, we have 65 percent homicide clearance rate. INGRAHAM: Wow, so it's not a third, basically, of what it was. ACREE: But it looks like the major has a strategic plan of gentrification, because as long as the homicide rate is 83 percent -- pardon me, 83 percent of the people are still free that commit murders, you're going to still have black people from the south side and the west side running out of town. People downtown are still going to be safe. People on the north side are still going to be safe. And so it seems like a strategic plan of gentrification by this administration. INGRAHAM: Wow, that's quite a charge. I wish the mayor were here to respond to that, but he's obviously not here. Hold on one second. Nicole Vaughn who identifies herself as a Democrat has a question for us. Nicole? NICOLE VAUGHN, POLITICAL AFFILIATION, DEMOCRATIC: Yes. So in the effort to cure violence in Chicago, why isn't economic development a priority, particularly in underserved communities? BROOKS: Well, part of it is, we keep doing the same thing over and over.  In our community, everybody is voting democrat. And you would think these same individuals are not creating economic development in your community, you would think that we would start to look in other places. And I think until we start to diversify how we are viewed politically ourselves, we're going to continue to get the same thing all the time. (APPLAUSE) INGRAHAM: It's not working. I think the question about economic development is a great one. Again, going back to the primary problem that we came here to discuss tonight. If the streets are unsafe, if people are afraid to walk out on the street, you're not going to get big businesses moving in to have those good paying jobs to keep young men and women feeling like there's another way except to join a gang. So it's a cycle of a nightmarish cycle without safety. All of you, thank you very much. Incredible conversation. Up next, FOX News political analyst and Chicago native Gianno Caldwell investigates some of the worst affected areas of the city ravaged by violence. He'll be there. Don't miss it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Welcome back to this \"Ingraham Angle\" town hall. Chicago's violence is hitting close to home for FOX News political analyst Gianno Caldwell who has watched in dismay as violence increasingly plagues his native city. This week Gianno he went to some of the worst impacted neighborhoods to ask residents how the mayhem is affecting their daily lives. Here's a sample. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right here. Like, what? It go down. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you've been shot? How many times have you been shot? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've been shot two times bro. Right there, bro, you feel me. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining us with more is Gianno Caldwell. We're all joined by Vic Maggio who is a citizen journalist who chronicles how violence is affecting these communities. Both of you, it's great to see you. Gianno, this is obviously near and dear to your heart. You're from here. You're infuriated. I'm not even from here and I'm getting more angry as we've gone on in this town hall. But we have to channel this to answers and solutions. Tell us what you -- if there's one thing that could change in the worst affected neighborhoods to make a real difference, what would it be? GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: First, two things. I want to thank you and coming and bringing the show to Chicago, doing this town hall. (APPLAUSE) CALDWELL: I know your heart. I know this is something you really care about. This isn't political, so I thank you for that. INGRAHAM: Thank you. CALDWELL: The second thing, because we're having conversations about solutions. We need to have an open dialogue. There was a guest in the first block who said that there is a myth about distrust between police and community. That's a false narrative. Certainly Laquan McDonald proves that out in terms of data. But in terms of this, your question, if there's one thing that can change, it's always going to end up with jobs and opportunity. And as I interviewed a number of residents throughout the city of Chicago, that was one thing that they yelled. There were so many that were married to the life because they had no exposure to anything else. So outside of saying I want jobs and opportunities, there no path to get there. And that's honestly something that needs to be worked on sincerely. VIC MAGGIO: When I realized how bad the problem was, when I first started going into the streets, I was sitting at a stoplight, and I have a squad car that I drive. And there was a young boy about five years old with his mother sitting underneath one of the bus enclosures. And I waved to the young man, and I started playing with the radio. And when I looked over at the young man he went like this to me. He was five years old. I realized how deep this problem really was. INGRAHAM: Talk about distrust. MAGGIO: And the next question I had was, who taught him that? INGRAHAM: Gianno, that's powerful. And again, it's Laquan McDonald, it's that narrative, and that means it's the whole relationship. That subsumes everything else in what can be actually a really positive and necessary relationship between a community and law enforcement. CALDWELL: That's true, too. But there has to be honesty I think when we're having these particular dialogues. I think there's so much we can do. And I know you've been advocating for President Trump to come in and do a town hall. We're having it. He does haven't to come here to do the town hall. He can just bring the solutions, sincerely, and that's what we're looking for. And you need help. We need mental health services. There's so much that's needed in this community. I think Mace (ph) Jackson rightly pointed out that the unemployment rate for African-Americans in the state of Illinois is the highest in the country. That's been the case. If you are an African-American man in the city of Chicago between the ages of 18 and 24, 47 percent of you are unemployed and out of school. INGRAHAM: In a booming economy. CALDWELL: In a booming economy. That survey was done a couple years ago. But the numbers I'm sure -- INGRAHAM: The lowest African-American unemployment on record. CALDWELL: Correct, nationally. But for the state of Illinois it's definitely, and the city of Chicago obviously more African-Americans -- INGRAHAM: Gianno, you found out more in your reporting on the street. What did you find? CALDWELL: Absolutely. We went into the Austin community, Englewood, we went all across the city of Chicago where the violence is at its highest. And we heard some interesting things from some of the gang members that were in the community perpetrating the violence. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We ain'ts supposed to be out here doing all this. Street shows up. I was like, you know, run up, get this, get that. I can't keep them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are going to do what they need to do to survive. They're going to rob, sell drugs, do whatever to survive. This is life. You got people who want to change and people who want to stay in the streets. And the people who try to change, it's even harder on them because they ain't used to a legit life. Like me, I'm trying to change but I ain't used to no legit life. This is what I'm used to, selling drugs. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If somebody were to give you a job, would you get out of the life? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got jobs and opportunities for you, resources. So if you get a job, if I help you get a job, you would get out of the life? You would no longer be involved in the gangs, 100 percent? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On live national television, you are saying you would get out of the game if you had that opportunity? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I would. CALDWELL: All right, we're going to make it happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: To see those young men, Vic the hope is there. Everyone here tonight could be anywhere. They decided to come and watch this show and chew over some ideas, frustration, solutions. But there's a desire for a better way. CALDWELL: And he just demonstrated that in the last clip. He said if you help me get a job an opportunity, I'll leave the life. I talked to a dear friend who is in the audience, Charles McKeever. I talked to him about it. He said, listen, I'll hire him. He spoke to him already, so he's already hired, this guy that you just saw in that last piece. So I think that speaks to, if you bring the resources to the door step, a lot of people will take them. But those resources have to be there. INGRAHAM: But Vic, you have to show up at a job with a sense of yourself. You have to put yourself together. You have to have skills, basic skills that you learn in school or from your parents. That's part of it. You can't just show up and say give me -- you have to show up and want a job and get the proper training to do that. And that's a great sense of fulfillment to get your first pay check, even if it's not as much as you want, if it's taxes and everything else, but to get your first pay check and it's legitimate. That's a great feeling. Who wants to be in a gang? It's not a good life. You'll end up dead, most likely. MAGGIO: But do you know what built these neighborhoods in Chicago were major corporations. INGRAHAM: Well, industry. MAGGIO: They built the structure. And when you go into these neighborhoods today you see vast swaths of land empty, empty. Why this mayor is not incentivizing businesses to come back here so that they can rebuild, give them the proper tools to rebuild these communities, and then everything else will fall around these industries that come into these communities. Property values will go up. What's happened is the industries left and the complete opposite effect -- INGRAHAM: The tax base is gone. The tax base is gone. MAGGIO: It is a huge thing, the economy in these neighborhoods, they're desolate. CALDWELL: But it's not just the government solution because there's a deficit of personal responsibility. And I met a man yesterday, Tyrone Muhammad (ph), who has a group, he has 300 ex-cons that he brings in to stop the violence. So we need to take advantage of the opportunities that exist in our community and we need to exercise what we have to stop the violence. INGRAHAM: A strong righteous man can do a lot to inspire young, dejected, disoriented young men. One righteous man. CALDWELL: With courage. INGRAHAM: And I bet you go in there, Gianno, you start talking to these guys, they're like he looks pretty cool. I want to be more like him. CALDWELL: I came from the same neighborhood of poverty. INGRAHAM: It doesn't matter. You came and you succeeded because you worked hard. Your nose to the grindstone. CALDWELL: My grandfather exposed me to different things. INGRAHAM: A father figures. CALDWELL: My father exposed me. MAGGIO: Your individual choice. That's what it comes down to. CALDWELL: Personal responsibility. INGRAHAM: Fantastic, thank you, Gianno. Love your piece, great to meet you. Great to see you. And coming up, it's one of the most horrific acts of Chicago gang violence today. The aunt of Demetrius Griffin joins us to speak about the murder of her 15-year-old nephew after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: We've talked a lot tonight about the causes of and potential solutions to Chicago's violence. But we also want to hear directly from a family member who has been deeply impacted by the mayhem. Even by Chicago standards the death of 15-year-old Demetrius Griffin Jr. is almost beyond comprehension. Demetrius was murdered in September of 2016 and a gang had tried recruiting him. Police say Demetrius was burned alive, his remains discovered in a 55-gallon drum in an alley. That's the kind of evil that society has had to deal with. Demetrius aunt Rochelle Sykes joins us now. Rochelle, thank you for being here. I know this is so hard. And I know some of Demetrius' friends and the family is here tonight. How is Poly, his mom, doing? ROCHELLE SYKES, AUNT OF TEEN KILLED BY GANG: Basically, she's distraught. She's basically not functioning. That was her only son. That was my only nephew. He was 15-years-old. There was nothing he could have ever done to anyone that would want someone to do that to him. He was about four-seven in height, about 97 pounds. They burned him alive in a garbage can. He wasn't in a gang. He didn't do drugs. What is it that he could have done so bad that a monster would take his life like that? And then two blocks from his home? We have to pass that lot every time we visit my mom. I can't go into the house without hearing him saying, titi, I did this, titi, I did that. He was looking so forward to high school. He only did two weeks of high school. He wanted to be on the swim team. He loved dogs. He loved animals. Why would you do that? Why would you burn someone alive? And then why is there such a code of silence that you did not hear him hollering for help, and did nothing? INGRAHAM: No one saw anything? SYKES: No one saw anything. INGRAHAM: No one said they saw anything. SYKES: Yes. INGRAHAM: No leads in this case at all? SYKES: No leads. INGRAHAM: So he's another statistic in the outrageous clearance rate in this city, meaning people not apprehended, not prosecuted, not jailed. SYKES: No suspects, nothing. INGRAHAM: My heart breaks for you, for Poly, for all his friends, schoolmates. Again, until -- you can't put yourself in a mother's place who has to go through this in America. SYKES: Right. And we did fundraising. We're still doing fundraising. We raised $10,000 with the help of leaders as well as Outraged Citizen and some of the people in the area, $10,000. Two years, $10,000. Nothing. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. INGRAHAM: I'm so sorry. SYKES: It's just that we have to protect our children. And if we have people that are leading our city not concerned with the protection of our children, then where do we stand as people? INGRAHAM: You need some new leadership in the city. SYKES: Yes, we definitely do. INGRAHAM: And it's not about Democrat, someone who knows how to run this city. SYKES: Someone who cares. We call the office for 30 days straight. We dialed 311. We called the mayor's office to get some acknowledgement. Superintendents, we reached out for them. INGRAHAM: Did Mayor Emanuel call you? SYKES: No, we have not heard from either one of them yet. INGRAHAM: Is that acceptable to any of you? SYKES: Not yet have we received -- INGRAHAM: A boy is burned alive and left in a 55-gallon drum and no one from city hall picks up the phone and says, we're going to find who did this. Until we turn over every stone, we're going to find who did this. SYKES: We got a resolution 16 months later. INGRAHAM: A resolution, yes, that's helpful. SYKES: Nothing. Not anything. We did not receive nothing. INGRAHAM: Your story, as horrific as it is, it's sadly repeated, not the same details, not the same level of suffering, thousands of times. And this has got to stop. Thank you for being here tonight. Thank you for sharing your story. Final thoughts when we come back. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Before we go, we owe a huge thank you to the participants in this town hall and the Chicago community for welcoming us. And we certainly hope that we did something to get us closer to some resolution. Discussions like this are just a start. We need more of them. And we certainly need a lot more trust, a lot more cooperation. And we have to do some self-reflecting along the way. This is not a story that ends for us here. You can be sure that we will continue to highlight the violence ravaging one of America's great cities, the heroes who are trying to stop it, and the innovators who are coming up with solutions. On behalf of the entire \"Ingraham Angle\" crew, I'm Laura Ingraham. Good night from Chicago. (APPLAUSE) END Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "Former U.S. attorney Joe diGenova reacts to Hannity's interview with Rudy Giuliani and says that the president should not grant an interview to Robert Mueller. This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" May 3, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: All right, Tucker. Great show, as always. And welcome to \"Hannity\". President Trump's attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani made massive news right here on this program last night. Now, he took James Comey the task. He said crooked Hillary ought to be in jail. He slammed Mueller's out-of-control witch hunt. He took James Comey to task and so much more. But tonight, this abusively biased news media in this country, they only cared about one 30-second clip. We had a 40-minute interview all making news. Now this, of course, regarding the revelation surrounding Stormy Stormy Stormy. Now, in moments, we're going to show you just how insane ridiculous the anti-Trump media and their echo chamber has now become in this country. Plus, we have breaking developments tonight over the FBI's investigation into Michael Cohen. Earlier today, fake news NBC reporting the FBI wiretap Trump's longtime personal attorney. Well, now, we're learning that much of that story was fake. We'll explain coming up. And finally, we have a massive development out of North Korea while the media is howling at the moon over Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels and Russia Russia Russia, they're visibly yawning over the report that three of our fellow Americans that were imprisoned by Kim Jong-un, they may soon be released. Sit tight, we've got this and so much more in tonight's important breaking news opening monologue. (MUSIC)  HANNITY: Last night, right here on this program, we did something you don't often see from so-called journalists. Yes, we actually broke news. Our lengthy interview with Rudy Giuliani covered a wide range of topics. It unearthed a lot of important insight into the Trump legal team, including this moment when the former New York City mayor, now President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani called out Robert Mueller's pathetic witch hunt. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: The president's right when he says witch hunt? RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: Yes, sure. You can't explain this any other way. First of all, they never should have been investigation. There was no Russian collusion. We're now a year and a half two years into this, no Russian collusion, case over. In falling all over themselves to investigate him, they have committed numerous violations. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Giuliani did not stop there. He also slammed the special counsel's questions to President Trump, you know, the ones recently leaked to the fake news \"New York Times\". Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI: When you look at those questions about what does the president think, what does the president feel, what does the president really desire, those are all questions intended to trap him in some way in contradictory, and what is in fact a very, very solid explanation of what happened. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: The former mayor is absolutely right. And breaking tonight, while Robert Mueller sets a perjury trap for President Trump, the special counsel has filed a request for 70 blank subpoenas in the case of Paul Manafort. In other words, Mueller now has the power to subpoena dozens of Americans, so long as he writes the name on the paper before he serves the documents. Wow, this is interesting. We'll analyze all of that, what is seemingly an aggressive legal tactic and one that we would expect from him. But, first, more news from my sit-down with the former mayor, including these comments that he made, the media paid little attention to, pay attention now about Hillary Clinton. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI: Thirteen crimes she committed and we got up to about 18. I'm sorry, Hillary, I know you're very disappointed you didn't win, but you're a criminal. Equal justice would mean you should go to jail. I do not know why the Justice Department is not investigating you. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Equal justice would being Hillary goes to jail. Giuliani also took on the disgraced former FBI Director James Comey. Let's watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI: You have an investigation in which Mueller is selected the day after he's turned down for FBI director by Rosenstein who was there when Mueller was turned down. There are thousands of people that could have been selected for that job. Also, a friend of James Comey and James Comey seems to be their core of their investigation. He's telling the truth the president isn't. I know James Comey, I know the president. Sorry, Jim, you're a liar, a disgraceful liar. Every FBI agent in America has his head down because of you. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: A disgraceful liar. The former mayor also slammed the FBI's handling of the Michael Cohen investigation. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI: The $130,000 payment, a settlement payment, which is a very regular thing for lawyers to do. The question there was, the only possible violation there would be was it a campaign finance violation. But usually the result in a fine by the way not this big storm of stormtroopers coming in and breaking down his apartment and breaking out his office. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Let's take a step back if you can believe it -- all the news we just laid out for you all those crucial developments that you just watched that we aired last night live on this program were largely ignored by the abusively biased news media in this country. Instead for 24 hours, these lazy these abusively biased echo-chamber people and the fake news overpaid media have been erupting over only one 30-second clip again and again and again. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI: Having something to do with paying some Stormy Daniels woman $130,000, I mean which is going to turn out to be perfectly legal. That money was not campaign money. Sorry, I'm giving you a fact now that you don't know. It's not campaign money. No campaign finance violation. So - - HANNITY: They funneled it through the law firm. GIULIANI: Funnel through a law firm and the president repaid it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: As usual the media's analysis their interpretation is all wrong. This doesn't change the fact the President Trump did not initially know about the payment or that the purpose was the payment that he didn't know initially, until a long time after the transaction took place. It doesn't change the fact that Michael Cohen took this action to benefit the company that he served as vice president and attorney for. Let's help the media follow the bouncing ball pay close attention so you can keep up. In January, \"The Wall Street Journal\", they first reported about the Cohen payment to Stormy Daniels which we know happened in October before the election. Then in February, in an interview with \"The New York Times\", Michael Cohen denied that neither the Trump campaign nor the Trump Organization had reimbursed him, meaning Michael Cohen. He had said he'd used his own money. Clearly leaving open the possibility that the president himself, then president-elect at the time might have reimbursed him from personal funds. On April 1st, President Trump -- well, he said this aboard Air Force One. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, no. What else? REPORTER: Then why did Michael Cohen make it if there was no truth to her allegations? TRUMP: You'll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael's my attorney, and you'll have to ask Michael. REPORTER: Do you know where he got the money to make that payment? TRUMP: No, I don't know. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And I meant when he's president. The president, he obviously knew about the story at this time. It had been so widely reported since January. What he is saying is he didn't know about the payment prior to the story being covered now of course this did not stop the mainstream media and their hysteria from reaching yet another fever pitch like the Russia, Russia, Russia story that they have no evidence on. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good evening, Rachel. And I have to confess I did not watch all of your show tonight because Rudy Giuliani went on the other network, went on Fox News and he stayed on longer than he should have because that's when he got to the Stormy Daniels admission, which is gigantic, which is blockbuster. LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC: And I thought he could be someone out there publicly defending the president and also someone who would take a harder line when it came to the Mueller investigation. But he seems to have just created another mess. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There seems to be a basic assumption that Rudy Giuliani had a strategy of some sort at all and I just remain unconvinced at this point that that's the case. JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: If Rudy Giuliani had been let's say counsel for IBM and delivered a performance that undercut IBM like he did last night for the president of the United States, he'd be fired the next morning. ANDREW KIRTZMAN, AUTHOR: In many ways, you know the hero of 9/11 is almost being forgotten. He's severely damaged his legacy. DANA BASH, CNN: What do you make of Giuliani's legal strategy here? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I liken it to a murder-suicide. He metaphorically murdered the president and committed suicide with respect to his own reputation. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: The 24-hour non-stop coverage was so constant, so obsessive, so outrageous -- well, it's actually almost funny, except it's too serious. But take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC: We'll begin with that stunning revelation from President Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Last night telling Fox News that Trump reimbursed his fixer Michael Cohen. PETER ALEXANDER, NBC: This was a stunning admission that Giuliani overnight says was approved by his boss the president, offering lately contradictory account about that payment to Stormy Daniels. JOHN BERMAN, CNN: After saying he did not know anything about the hush money payments to an adult film actress who said they had sex, now he says he reimbursed his lawyer for making those payments. GAYLE KING, CBS: Startling admission by Rudy Giuliani leaves President Trump facing new legal questions this morning about whether he knew it about an attempt to silence Stormy Daniels. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: How many times have I said journalism in America is dead it's almost unbelievable but it's all too predictable. The media just cannot stop playing this show meaning, \"Hannity\", and the interviews that we conduct. It seems like they're featuring me more than their own hosts. I'm beginning to think at this point maybe I need to start collecting a paycheck from ABC, CBS, NBC, fake news CNN and the conspiracy theory network MSNBC, and you know what, because I'm providing the real news that they rarely make on their own. Let's turn to even more fake news. Earlier today, and this is serious, NBC broke a big story, a serious story about Michael Cohen. OK, according to the original report, Cohen had been wiretapped weeks before the FBI raided his home and office and his hotel room. And there was even more damning developments from NBC News. Take a look at their report. (BEGN VIDEO CLIP) TOM WINTER, NBC: This wiretap occurred several weeks before the now public search warrant that was executed here in New York several weeks ago. In addition to that, we've learned that at least one phone call conversation between a line belonging to Michael Cohen and the White House was also intercepted. We know from court papers, federal prosecutors have already said that they conducted covert surveillance of Michael Cohen's emails leading up to the search warrant being executed. So, this is a lot more than just knocking on the door and asking for some documents. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And now we're learning that a major component of this report was once again fake news. NBC was forced to issue a, quote, correction, that reads in part, quote: 'Three senior U.S. officials now dispute the wiretapping, saying that the modern monitoring of Cohen's phones was limited to a log of calls known as a pen register, not a wiretap, where investigators can actually listen to the calls.' Yet again, fake news from NBC. While the media is busy reporting all the fake news about Michael Cohen and spinning in circles over a small tiny portion of my 40-minute interview with Rudy Giuliani, well, we have actual news about the lives of three of our fellow Americans long held hostage by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The little rocket man. President Trump is currently working on their release and is hinting of some very hopeful news on Twitter. He wrote: 'As everybody's aware, the past administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned.' This is just one new positive development from the Korean peninsula that is seeing now tremendous progress under our new president. Let's break this down. Three American lives are at stake. Your mainstream media is yawning, paying very little attention. Kim Jong Un is making unprecedented concessions, the mainstream media is yawning. We're talking about denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula, we have historically low unemployment now in states, record lows -- the media yawns. Americans receiving unemployment is the lowest since 1973, the media could care less. African-American unemployment, Hispanic unemployment, women in the workforce unemployment 17-year lows record lows, the media could care less. Do you need any more proof that the news media in this country does not care about the truth, about doing their job, about you? They care about their liberal left-wing pathetic agenda and they're like one big huge massive echo chamber with a bunch of overpaid, spoiled brat anchors that don't do their job.  Joining us now, former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova. For full disclosure, as always, he has done some legal work for me in the past. He and his wife Victoria attended my radio show Christmas party and we did share drinks together and we talked and we laughed. Good to see you, sir. JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: You too. HANNITY: You know, so much news was made in that interview. DIGENOVA: Indeed. HANNITY: And you saw the coverage, let's start there, your reaction. What does it say -- what does it say to the American consumer about the news industry in general in this country? DIGENOVA: Well, I think when you take a look at the White House Correspondents' Dinner and the conduct of the people there and when you look at the absence of coverage of something so major as your show last night, it's pretty clear, Sean, that you're right. American journalism is dead, it's dying, it's in a coffin and the fact is these people are not journalists anymore. They're people with an agenda. They want to prove something. They don't want to find something out. They want to say something on their own and this is an example of it. It's really a sad day, a sad, sad day. HANNITY: Joe, we've had massive surveillance abuse unmasking abuse we've had the leaking of raw intelligence. Samantha Power, unmasking a person a day. And then we have the bigger scandal, Rudy Giuliani is right, Hillary committed felonies, Hillary obstructed Justice. James Comey, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Andrew McCabe, and Loretta Lynch, they rigged that investigation. Then, of course, with the supposed Trump Russia collusion, it turns out Hillary is paying a foreign national to get use Russian sources that turn out to be debunked, and then those -- that false political document, that dossier is using for a FISA warrant to spy on an American associated with the Trump campaign in the lead-up to an election. They're virtually silent on the biggest abuse of power, scandal in the history of the country. DIGENOVA: Well, I don't think there's any doubt that that judgment you've just made is absolutely correct. It is quite evident now that the Mueller probe is illegitimate this effort to attempt to interview the president of the United States has now reached the point where there's no doubt at all that the president should refuse to be interviewed by them, and that's because it's clear that Mueller and his team of Democratic thugs are acting in bad faith. They that the president under Department of Justice rules cannot be indicted. They have no evidence to indict him. The office of Robert Mueller was created by Rod Rosenstein illegally, there he mentioned no crime to be investigated. All of this leads to the ultimate conclusion that the perpetuation of this investigation by Mueller is doing grave damage to United States, it's doing grave damage to United States foreign policy. It's doing grave damage to U.S. law enforcement because of the thug-like tactics that have been used in the Manafort case and in the Cohen case. And it points to something that really is disturbing. After watching the deputy attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, accused Congress of trying to extort him and others in the department by conducting legitimate constitutional oversight, I would say that between Mueller and Rosenstein and the absent attorney general, God bless him, we have a very serious crisis in American federal law enforcement. HANNITY: Oh I agree, and I think it's the biggest abuse of power, corruption, scandal in our history. DIGENOVA: Yes. HANNITY: I'll stay on Rod Rosenstein a second. DIGENOVA: Yes, please. HANNITY: Rod Rosenstein wrote a letter said the FBI could never recover if James Comey stayed at the helm, so he would be a witness on that part of it. DIGENOVA: Correct. HANNITY: We've also discovered that Rod Rosenstein, we talked about the FISA applications that relied on unverified, uncorroborated -- a dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton, they never told the judge it was paid for by Hillary, and then he went on to say that if you had -- there are false information presented to a FISA court, there's serious consequences, isn't he implicating himself the same statement when he said that he's not going to be extorted? DIGENOVA: Of course. The problem here for Rod Rosenstein and he has multiple conflicts of interest, he shouldn't be supervising this case. He wrote the memoranda that led to the firing of James Comey. He signed the FISA applications. He continues to know and personally care about Comey and Mueller and others. He should be removed from this case. This is absolutely disgraceful. And now, he will pretend that he is above all of this, but when all is said and done, Mr. Rosenstein represents a part of the department that I thought we had lost a long time ago when the Obama administration people left office. But apparently, they haven't left office. HANNITY: Joe, we're headed for a showdown -- DIGENOVA: Yes. HANNITY: -- and that is every attorney that I know says the president should never sit with Robert Mueller, Andrew Weissmann, his pit bull, with his atrocious track record, his team of Democratic donors only. And if the showdown goes down and the president says, no, if they won't agree to a proper written answers to legitimate questions which I don't think they will at this point, then that means that it's likely that Robert Mueller will then subpoena the president of the United States before a grand jury. This is where it gets somewhat legally a little bit tricky. Let's walk down that road. What happens when and what should the response be? DIGENOVA: Well, first of all, I think that if Mueller issued a subpoena to the president, it would be an unconstitutional subpoena, since he knows the president cannot be indicted and since he knows that the president is not a necessary witness to anything that he is investigating. It is clear that he would be using the grand jury subpoena for only one reason, to get testimony from the president to use in an impeachment recommendation report to the deputy attorney general. That is an illegal use of a grand jury subpoena. The president should resist it. They should take it all the way to the Supreme Court because under Article II of the Constitution, all executive power rests in the president of the United States. He had -- he had ultimate authority to fire James Comey and he did. Mueller cannot ask him about that. HANNITY: And if the court makes a wrong decision and -- DIGENOVA: Oh, of course, the courts can always be wrong. HANNITY: We know that. DIGENOVA: It's going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if he issues a subpoena. Let me make a prediction: Mueller will never issue a subpoena. HANNITY: Why? DIGENOVA: Because he cannot win. I disagree with some of the comments of Judge Napolitano earlier about the fact that that Mueller will win ultimately on a subpoena. Let me just say this, Mueller will lose ultimately on a subpoena because it is unconstitutional -- HANNITY: If it was granted and the president pled the Fifth, then they would offer him immunity and then the perjury trap remains, correct or not? DIGENOVA: That is technically correct, but you cannot issue immunity to someone when you are doing it illegally under the statute, because the only reason he would be giving him immunity would be to force testimony for an impeachment report. Mueller does not have the authority to issue an impeachment report and he does not have the authority to use a grand jury subpoena to get presidential testimony for impeachment or any other criminal activity that never occurred because he's dealing with the power of the president to fire people. So, if Mueller wants to have that fight and tie it up in the courts for six months to a year he can do it, but he will be doing a grave disservice to himself. Because at this point, Mueller has become a cross between Madame Defarge and Inspector Javert and it's an embarrassment. HANNITY: All right. Joe DiGenova, always appreciate you being on the program. All right. When we come back, things are just getting started. Dan Bongino, Sebastian Gorka, they are coming up. And also, don't miss him, the great one, Mark Levin, weighing in. He has a lot to say tonight as we continue. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI: I know James Comey, I know the president. Sorry, Jim, you're a liar, a disgraceful liar. Every FBI agent in America has his head down because of you. This has become a witch hunt like the president said and if you look at those questions that are being asked their trap questions, a first-year prosecutor would do better than that. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: What were you thinking about James Comey, Jeff Sessions and the special counsel -- you're allowed to have thoughts. You can't criminalize thoughts. That's how idiotic that list of questions was. Anyway, that was more of my interview from last night with Rudy Giuliani. The media continues to distort every aspect of this interview. Look at, for example, Joyless Behar on \"The View\". She went off the rails yet again today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOY BEHAR, THE VIEW: I'll take a psychological position. I think that Giuliani is unconsciously throwing him under the bus because he didn't make him the attorney general or the chief of staff there. That's what's going on. Giuliani loves to be the center of attention. When Bill Bratton was on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, because he cleaned up crime in the city, he was fired very shortly thereafter, because Giuliani wanted to get -- that's Giuliani. I'm going to give you a tip from -- (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: That's Joy Behar. She's not a genius and obviously she didn't watch the full interview because Rudy Giuliani said on the program last night, he was offered the job and he regretted turning it down. They want to pay attention. Anyway, joining us now with reaction, former deputy assistant to the president, FOX News national security strategist, Sebastian Gorka, NRATV contributor, former Secret Service agent, Dan Bongino. Let's start with you, Dr. Gorka. It's a pretty fundamental thing, all the things that the mayor said last night, the president's attorney said last night about Hillary, about Mueller, about Comey, about the investigation, huge news that he's making here, and they focus on 30 seconds because that's where the corrupt media goes. They don't want to hear the truth. DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: First things first, Sean, I have to congratulate you because you're getting close to the president's record for living rent-free in the mind of the liberal left media. (LAUGHTER) GORKA: They're obsessed with you. They're obsessed with you. And I like how they spend the whole day -- I followed it all day -- how they selected one half a sentence from the mayor's statement on your show, but they missed the beginning where he said, amongst other things, that's the reason why he was fired. These people haven't even past year one in journalism school, and they have to maintain a narrative. It's like those 49 questions. Those 49 questions are a mark of desperation. There is no case, there is no conclusion, so three quarters of those questions are about trying to police your thoughts. We only do that in dictatorships. We don't do that in America, Sean. HANNITY: Yes, and by the way, these are the actual questions. What did you think about Comey's testimony? What did you think about Sessions' recusal? What did you think about the appointment of a special counsel? It doesn't matter what he thought. GORKA: No. HANNITY: It matters what he did, and the fact that that goes over their head, on the one hand, it infuriates me, on the other hand, I got a laugh. Dan Bongino, look at this, that Rudy Giuliani the president's attorney, talked about how Mueller's questions are a perjury trap. He talked about Comey -- we just played it -- being a disgraceful liar, and how the probe is tainted. He talked about how Hillary's a criminal belongs in jail and that Comey fixed the entire case with Hillary. Then he talked about how Comey should be prosecuted for leaking confidential information. None of that for the most part is covered today. But the only thing they cover is Stormy, Stormy and they even got that wrong. DAN BONGINO, NRATV CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Sean, they are invested in it now. They can't get away from the Russia hoax. They are embedded in this. And sold it for a year. But Sea, this is a case built by liar for liars. The three liars, Clapper, Brennan and Comey. They built this on a bed of lies as collusion hoax for liars up on Capitol Hill and people in the media that had to obstruct the Trump presidency with a fake collusion hoax. This is nonsense. And on the topic of the question, Sean. Let me just tell you, when I was a Secret Service agent. I went to a very sophisticated advanced interrogation school. I actually came to our training center, one of the things they always taught us, when you are trying to get people into a trap, in an interview is ask open ended question. Don't just ask is your Sean Hannity. You are just going to say yes. An open ended question would be, well what is your name? Be if you are involve in an identity theft case, you may slip up and actually give the wrong name. That is what they are trying to do. Do not do this interview, it is a huge mistake, it is a trap. HANNITY: What do you think, Sebastian? To the very point? GORKA: The president right now, I had been saying this from the beginning, should never, ever sit down. Joe, Victoria are right. And they have no right to do this. And the president cannot be indicted. At the end of the day, this is a perjury trap. Nothing more, nothing less. This man wants a scalp. Mueller wants to scalp and along with Comey and McCabe, they have destroyed the reputation of the FBI. I am getting text today from FBI agents saying, they record every meeting they go to now, because jurors no longer believe them. These men have destroyed the FBI. HANNITY: No. I will never sweep with a broad brush here. This is a few in the top. Not the rank and file. Dan, you said you work with this guys. We know how great they are. BONGINO: Great. They are terrific. But Sean, all they -- listen to me, guys. They have nothing. Do you understand Mueller has nothing? You can't fabricate collusion that didn't happen. This isn't back to the future with Marty McFly. There is nothing here, Sean. So what do they have, all they have is process crime leading to the FBI and a perjury trap. They have nothing. HANNITY: When you think for the President of the United States. You would think for the country, first here. For them to succeed -- GORKA: They don't love their country, Sean. It is about them, it is about America. HANNITY: That is sad. And if we lose, this is Venezuela and it is not the United States. When we come back, the great one, Mark Levin, you do not want to miss this and Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. As Mueller's witch hunt continues, you might remember the great one, Mark Levin right here on this show, last summer explaining the DOJ policy that said the sitting President cannot be indicted. This is something that the media trying to forget. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK LEVIN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: It has been the position of the United States Department of Justice under Republican and Democrats, in a 1973 memorandum and in an October memorandum, under the Clinton administration. That you must not and cannot indict a sitting President, not that this President would be. That is not my point. As a matter of constitutional interpretation. For 44 years that is the position of the Department of Justice. We have had law professor and homeless people, would be law professors, all over TV and radio talking about obstruction of justice. We had media types talking about it. We have members of Congress talking about it. And it doesn't matter. The official position of the Justice Department is, we don't charge a sitting President with a crime. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Mark reiterated that point on this show just a few weeks ago. You may remember. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEVIN: A sitting president's immune ability to indictment and criminal prosecution, the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting president would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the Executive Branch to performed its constitutionally assigned function. Page after page after page. Saying a sitting United States President cannot be indicted. Now, my question is this, did they issue another memo over that, the Justice Department, reversing this two memo's during the Nixon administration and the Clinton administration. No. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: He joins us all with reaction, the host of CRTV Levin TV. The host of Life, Liberty Levin. The number one show Sunday night, 10 Eastern right here on the Fox News channel and I call him the great one. Mark Levin, I wanted to play that again, because as usual on legal matters you are ahead of the curve, you are a constitutional attorney and our lazy overpaid liberal activist that calls themselves journalist are wrong like 99 percent of the time. So, I want you to go through this legally tonight and give you the opportunity to explain to them yet, again. LEVIN: All right. Sean, this is not me speaking, this is the Department of Justice speaking and the position of the Justice Department has not been repealed and has not been amended since the last decision on October 16th, 2000. The president of the United States, this is getting way to complicated and unnecessarily so. You have a lot of second tier slip and fall lawyers all over TV. Spewing things they don't know. They don't understand the constitution, they haven't studied the cases, and I have. First of all, this opinion said among other things like grand jury and prosecutors cannot supplant Congress. It cannot supplant Congress. The only way to remove a sitting president is through the impeachment process. Not through the indictment process. They cannot disable or ham string a presidency which is what they are trying to do as I speak. A prosecutor cannot trigger the 25th Amendment. The 25th Amendment is the purpose is not to be triggered by a prosecutor and he can't step in and try and take advantage of it. These are things that were discussed. A President cannot properly defend himself in litigation under the constitution as an individual American, when he has time that he has to spend on official duties. Unlike so many other individuals, the president of the United States they point up is so unique in our constitutional system that it is enormously damaging to him, because he can't focus on his defense which is different on civil litigation and he can't focus during that time on the nation's security and well-being. And the President can't function properly with these kinds of burdens. This is what the memo says. And he can't be indicted as a sitting president. Period. This is why, despite all the problem about our presidents have received subpoenas before. Tell me, name one president who has ever been before a federal grand jury. There has never been a president in front of a Federal Grand Jury. Ken Starr's team subpoena Bill Clinton by having among other things not sex so much for an intern in the Oval Office, but lying about litigation that was taking place. And he was subpoenaed and he decided to do a video. So here is my advice, to the President of the United States. He didn't seek it and to his lawyers. Focus. You are making this too complicated. The constitution is on the side of the president. The Department of Justice's its own position which you can brief yourselves is on the side of the President of the United States. Historical precedent is on the side of the president of the United States. Legal president is on the side of the president of the United States. Stop listening to all of the babbling and pleading the Fifth and should he sit down with a subpoena. I would say if I were the president's lawyer to Mr. Mueller. We want you to present us with an explanation of your defiance of the Department of Justice policy which you are required to follow as an employee of the Department of Justice. Moreover we want to understand how it is that you believe that you can burden a president like this while he is in office. And while I am at it, Sean, it seem to have a few Republicans in the senate who are very confused about this things. Who had voted to protect Mr. Mueller rather than protect the Office of the President and the Constitution, and the American people? And they seem to think that they have the power even though we have a separation of powers and tell the president who he can hire and who we can fire. The part of the problem of the president has is his dealing with ignoramuses spoken inside his party and outside of his party and some whom are dressed up as lawyers. So, I would take this all the way to the United States Supreme Court. I would make Mueller and his band of Democrat prosecutors make their case all the way to the United States Supreme Court. If they try to subpoena him in any `way to appear before a federal grand jury and make them and make their case against their own Department of Justice against Supreme Court precedent and against the constitution of the United States. And if it takes six months, it takes six months. If it takes six years, and by god it takes six years, we are not just talking about the President which would be enough. We are talking about protecting the Office of the Presidency, separation of powers and when you look at those 49 areas of questions. There is not a single criminal statute. There is not a single obstruction. What has been obstructed? They are not investigating Russia. What is it that they are not investigating that they don't want to investigate? No. They want to know his intent on whether he obstructed. They want to treat him like they treated Martha Stewart. Well, guess what, he is the President Mr. Mueller. This is a one year failed anthrax cases or one of your failed Bloody Borger cases (ph). This is the president of the United States. You know what that means? We the people have a stake in this and we the people get to decide. The frame is decided, the only way you remove a President is through the body politics, from the House and the Senate and it is a heavy burden, not by some rogue prosecutor with a bunch of Democrat prosecutors. They don't get to do it and the people need to rise up and demand. Demand that this go all the way to the Supreme Court to put this rogue prosecutors in their place. HANNITY: That is why I call you the great one. This abusively, politically biased and frankly ethically challenged Mueller team. There is the answer, Mark Levin. Every Sunday night, 10 Eastern, Life, Liberty, Levin. Thank you, sir. Always good to have you. When we come back, Sarah Carter, Greg Jarret, they weigh in on some breaking news. Straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUDY GUILIANI, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: I'm sorry, Hillary, I know you are very disappointed you didn't win. But you are a criminal and equal justice would mean you should go to jail. I do not know why the Justice Department is not investigating you. HANNITY: Did James Comey -- GUILIANI: James Comey fix the whole case in this. HANNITY: It was rigged. GUILIANI: Well, you can't read the stupid report that he wrote. Which is the beginning of his disruption in which he -- he said we are not going to prosecute. No reasonable prosecutor would indict her. No honest reasonable prosecutor wouldn't indict her. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. That was the president's attorney Rudy Guiliani on this program last night. Yes, talking about Hillary Clinton. Hillary is a criminal and Comey fixed the whole case. Oh that is pretty big news. Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor, Sara Carter, the author of the soon to be released book. Look at her right there. Already the liberals are attacking it. They haven't read it yet, The Russia Hoax, the elicit scheme to clear Hillary Clinton and framed Donald Trump. Fox News Legal Analyst, Gregg Jarrett. Now, this whole issue of allowing the president to talk to Mueller. Rudy said first thing, there is not a lawyer in the country that advices that. GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEAGL ANALYTS: No, because Mueller is proven that he cannot be fair and neutral and objective. Why would you subject your client, the president of the United States to somebody who has every intent of being unfair to you? So my recommendation would be, if Mueller will not accept answers to a limited number of written questions. Then let Mueller subpoena the president in front of a grand jury and then I would ignore the subpoena, why? Because Mueller would then have to move to hold the president in contempt which eventually means detention or arrest. That would be unconstitutional and the framers wrote that in the Supreme Court has confirmed that that would be unconstitutional. And interior unelected officer may not remove -- HANNITY: So, why is anybody -- why are they all making such a big deal about it? He does not have to do a thing. JARRETT: Well, because I think the misunderstanding part, because the thing that President Clinton complied with the subpoena, he didn't. The subpoenaed was actually withdrawn by mutual consent and it was relative to a civil case and not a criminal case. HANNITY: Very different and all the while which we had been pointing out, all of this other news, Sara. A lot of it corroborating your hard work as an investigative journalist. You know beyond the fact that Mueller is setting a perjury trap. But Comey is a disgraceful liar. Gregg is talking about, I talked about it, and you have talked about that. Mueller's probe is tainted. Hillary is a criminal. It all begins with Hillary Clinton. It all begins with 18USC793 in the espionage act and the obstruction which was represented by the leading subpoenaed emails, acid washing a hard drive and beating up your devices with a hammer and Strzok and Comey and McCabe and Loretta Lynch and others put the fix in the exoneration before the investigation. SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely and Rudy Guiliani was right on the Mark. Look, we know that Michael Horowitz is going to release a report very soon on Comey's handling. HANNITY: How soon? CARTER: Very soon. I would imagine within weeks. He is waited -- look he has waited for Comey to begin talking and he is listening to what he says. He is going to be listening to that to include it in the report. And all we have to do is look back, Sean. All we have to do is look back and realize that from the very beginning. Remember it was May 9, so it is almost a year to this date, when Comey was fired. When Comey was fired by who? None other than Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who advised the President to fire him. And what did he cite in his memorandum. He cited the Clinton investigation saying how it just completely destroyed the FBI. He even put quotes in there from former FBI Directors, from Intelligence Director, really hammering on Comey and his handling of the case. I can tell you this, Horowitz is going to have a scatting report against Comey. Comey knows that is coming out. That is why he lawyer up and he has a lot of problem. HANNITY: Who else is likely to be mentioned? CARTER: Oh, Andrew McCabe, certainly. I would imagine that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr. So there is going to be a very intensive investigation. HANNITY: And Loretta Lynch? CARTER: Yes. Absolutely. Loretta Lynch. She was a big part of all of this. HANNITY: What about -- I don't throw this -- what about people like Clapper and Brennan? Brennan, really, I took it as a threat, you know, stay tuned to the President of the United States. JARRETT: Yes. I think Brennan and to some extent Clapper were the two instigators of the phony dossier. HANNITY: By the way, did they both lie under oath? JARRETT: Well, one can argue that Brennan or Clapper certainly did and got away with it and the statute of limitation -- HANNITY: It won't happen. JARRETT: Well, there could be, but look, they were the instigator, but those who I think very clearly should be prosecuted under felony statute would include James Comey at the top of the list and Andrew McCabe. HANNITY: When we hear about Susan Rice. When we hear about ben Rhodes, Sara, when hear about Samantha Powers basically unmasking an American a day? CARTER: I hope we do hear about Samantha Powers. I don't know if we are going to hear about all of the players. But I do have one thing to say Sean, Brennan was in charge of the CIA. The CIA is supposed to deal with exclusively with foreign issues. What is Brennan doing involving himself in whether it is FBI issues and our nation's security issues that have nothing to do with foreign issues. We should be asking Brennan, why are you involving yourself in this? This is not part of the CIA. HANNITY: We got to break. All right. Thank you both. Good luck with the book. We will review the following, Hillary Clinton's latest excuse of why she lost next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right since her crashing election lost in 2016. Hillary Clinton has come pretty long list of excuses as you can see inside of your screen. Yesterday at the Shared Value Leadership summit, she twice failed presidential candidate a loser, had a new excuse take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You may be the only presidential candidate since World War II that actually had to stand up and say, I am a capitalist. And you did. Did it hurt you? HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Probably, I mean, you know, it's hard to know but, I mean, if you are in the Iowa caucuses and 41 percent of Democrats are socialists or self-described socialists, then I answer you are a capitalist and I say yes, but with appropriate regulation and appropriate accountability. You know, that probably gets lost in the, oh, my gosh, she is a capitalist. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: You lost because you had a terrible vision for the future, and Barack Obama had 13 million more Americans on the food stamp rolls, 8 million more on poverty and we are doing so much better now.

This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" October 26, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: This is a Fox News Alert. The man suspected of mailing more than a dozen apparent pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and media figures has been arrested and charged in the State of Florida. The suspect, Cesar Sayoc Jr., has been charged with five federal counts. He could face decades in prison, if convicted on those. Fox News' Phil Keating is outside the FBI offices in Miramar, Florida for us tonight and has the very latest on this developing story. Phil? PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS: Tucker, the man accused of mailing political pipe bomb packages to 14 high-profile Democrats over the past four days, well he's behind bars tonight, including two presidents were receiving these packages and this put the nation in a chaotic watch for the suspect for three days. 56-year old, Cesar Sayoc, described by those who knew him as a hateful, disturbed man with extreme political views, seen walking in custody this afternoon, from the Miami FBI building to - to an SUV to be transported to Downtown Miami's Federal Detention Center where he is tonight. 56-year old Sayoc now faces five federal counts, including illegal mailing of explosives and making threats against former presidents. And if - if convicted on each, he faces 48 years in federal prison basically the rest of his life. After a fourth morning of political pipe bombs being discovered, suddenly, the FBI made the arrest at an AutoZone parking lot in Broward County. That revealed the man's very unique van which he'd apparently been living in placard with dozens upon dozens of ideological stickers and decals, including one of President Trump rising from the flames of a burning American flag, and a Hillary Clinton face in the crosshairs. That van was then covered with a blue tarp and escorted under heavy guard to the FBI's Miami division, all broadcast live on national TV. This afternoon, from Washington, the Attorney General said any political zealot who turns violence of any stripe will pay heavily. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS: We will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats, intimidation, and outright violence to further an agenda. We will find you. We will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law. (END VIDEO CLIP) KEATING: Federal investigators suspected that the package bombs may have come from the South Florida Postal Sorting Center. And overnight, sure enough, after evacuating the building, FBI and Miami-Dade police went in, searched, and found bomb number 11, that one addressed to Democratic Senator Cory Booker. It was there but had not yet been sent off to his office. Now, Sayoc has a lengthy criminal history in going back numerous years that includes a 2002 threat to use a bomb and a 2014 shoplifting case. Well those put his fingerprints in the National Database, and that helped FBI agents make a match to a fingerprint found on the package sent to California's Maxine Waters. Tucker. CARLSON: Phil Keating for us in Florida tonight. Thank you, Phil. Dan Bongino, former Secret Service Agent, author of Spygate, joins us tonight. Dan this, I mean and I guess this is always true, is not exactly what we expected. When this man's apprehended, he turns out to be a middle- aged male stripper who identifies as an American Indian. These bombs may or may not been operative. What - what do we know about this story that we didn't know yesterday? What conclusions can we draw from the facts we have right now? DAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT: Well I can say having worked Protective Intelligence Cases in the Secret Service for many years, which are the cases where we investigate threat cases basically, out of the New York office, which was very busy that the pattern here is actually not that unusual. You know, I've actually discussed this on - on Fox a couple times before, Tucker. You know, when you see movies like \"In the Line of Fire,\" a lot of people are obviously influenced by what happens in Hollywood, they think that's the real world. You see this target that's singularly focused on one subject. \"Taxi Driver\" -- CARLSON: Right. BONGINO: --with, you know, used in De Niro movie, right, that's not the way it really works in the real world. What you see is pretty common with what you saw with the accused attacker today, where they - we call target shifting, where they actually pick multiple targets at the same time. That's more common in the real world than it - and for - from our perspective, is indicative of - of a greater danger than that one person who focuses on that one so and stalks that one person. CARLSON: For - for sure. What do you make of the fact that none of these devices exploded? And I just want to be clear, that doesn't minimize-- BONGINO: Yes. CARLSON: --the terror that they inspired. BONGINO: Sure. CARLSON: It's horrifying. But does it tell us something that they didn't go off? Where they intended to go off and he was an inept bomb-maker? What can we conclude? BONGINO: Well there's only two possible explanations for this. One is that he didn't intend them to go off, and had done his homework on it and intended them, as you said, to inspire terror again, no less devious, as you said, but obviously, less deadly if they don't go off than if they do. CARLSON: Right. BONGINO: The second explanation, which I believe is more plausible in this case, is that he just was completely inept. The word you used, I think, is accurate. I think he was just entirely completely inept, Tucker. I mean the mistakes in this case, thankfully, I mean, and I say that in a positive way, the mistakes in this case are just incredible, simple misspellings of names, sending packages to CNN where John Brennan doesn't even work, I mean the use of tape. You know, Tucker, that's how they get fingerprints, tape. That's how police print officers-- CARLSON: Right. BONGINO: --in police departments get fingerprints, using tape. It's just such an amateur-hour operation, thankfully, that I think inept is the proper word. I - I don't think he intended these things not to go off. I think he was just really bad at this, if the accusations are correct. CARLSON: If this man did what he is accused of doing, the profile is I don't think what you would expect. Again, this is a man in his mid-50s, who identifies anyway as a Seminole Indian and has worked apparently for decades as a male stripper. You typically think of crimes like this is being committed by young men. He's not. Neither was the shooter in Las Vegas. Are we wrong in thinking that mass killing is typically create - inspired or carried out by young people? BONGINO: Well, in this case, Tucker, I would attribute a lot of this, and I've seen this in some of the investigations I conducted into similar threat cases, where mail - the mail was used, whether the mail a threat or not, narcissism may be at play here, and I mean extreme narcissism. CARLSON: Yes. BONGINO: I don't mean looking in the mirror and combing your hair. I mean when you look at the-- CARLSON: Right. BONGINO: --the background of this guy, apparently, again, these are allegations, of course. But a - a - a former coworker said he was a - a steroid user, was obsessed with working out. This extreme narcissism and thinking you're somehow going to change the political process, and you're the guy to turn this around, it's - it's actually not that uncommon. And that target shifting is important. That was always a bull's-eye to me that this person was a bigger danger than he was letting on if - if we found evidence that they were targeting multiple people at the same time. It's not just the quantity of people. It's the fact that they are so obsessed with doing something that they're not even willing to focus on one person, they'll get anyone. So it's not, it's-- CARLSON: Right. BONGINO: --the profile is pretty - pretty serious on this. CARLSON: This is a very weird story. And so, I look forward to-- BONGINO: Very weird. CARLSON: --finding out more. Yes, I think we all do. Thanks, Dan, very much. Good to see you. BONGINO: Yes, sir. CARLSON: Thousands of Central American migrants are making their way to our Southern border to claim asylum. Meanwhile, the city of San Francisco, which is completely out of control and filthy wants to let illegal aliens vote in some local elections. That'll make things better. That's next. And the President, meanwhile, rallying supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, as we speak. We're monitoring that rally. And, of course, we'll take you there live if news occurs. We'll be right back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --then they go back to the White House. Look at this crowd, it's crazy. (CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Go out and vote tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) Immigration advocate Roberto Hernandez argues the U.S. policies in Central America entitle the migrants to asylum in this country. CARLSON: Well the President has threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border and cut aid to various Central American countries in response to the massive Caravan of migrants making its way slowly up from Mexico. Secretary of Defense, General Jim Mattis, has also ordered hundreds of U.S. troops, about 800, to the U.S.-Mexico border in anticipation of their arrival. Roberto Hernandez is an immigration advocate, who lives in San Francisco. He says he's happy the migrants are coming. He joins us tonight. Roberto, thanks very much for coming on. I don't expect to convince you to change your views on immigration. We've talked many times. I know what they are. But I applaud you for being more honest than most on the Left in saying out loud what you really want. So, I - I want to use you to inform our viewers about the aims of the Left. Tell me what the justification for this group coming here is. If they wanted asylum, they could have applied in the embassy in Tegucigalpa. They're instead coming to our border. Are they claiming that they're refugees, fleeing a war? If so, what war? What is the justification for this? ROBERTO HERNANDEZ, IMMIGRATION ACTIVIST: Good evening. First of all, let's go to our history. You know, here in the Americas-- CARLSON: No. Let's not. Let's just go to the question. HERNANDEZ: --we've always welcomed people around the world. CARLSON: OK. HERNANDEZ: Look at all the Europeans that came here. This was Native American land and Europeans came-- CARLSON: All right. HERNANDEZ: --here. CARLSON: OK. HERNANDEZ: --this is the Americas-- CARLSON: You've demonstrated an ignorance of history sufficient -- HERNANDEZ: --and we should always-- CARLSON: --that I don't want you trying to educate us-- HERNANDEZ: --welcome people. CARLSON: --and that I just want you to answer my question about right now, if that's OK, if we just stick to the question, what is the justification, the legal justification, for these people coming to our border and not the U.S. embassy in Tegucigalpa? HERNANDEZ: Well if you look at the role of the United States in Central America, in Nicaragua, in Honduras, in Guatemala, in other countries, in Latin America, the United States has promoted wars to protect corporate interests in a lot of these countries. And so-- CARLSON: OK. HERNANDEZ: --you have a lot of people who have been affected by these wars, and it's caused poverty in a lot of these countries. And currently, there are - is a political climate in a lot of these countries, and people are coming here looking for refugee-- CARLSON: OK. HERNANDEZ: --and we should-- CARLSON: So, let - let - let's - let's - hold on, no, OK-- HERNANDEZ: --welcome these people-- CARLSON: --I'm - I'm going to try and take you seriously-- HERNANDEZ: --the fact is that the United Nations is -- CARLSON: --what, OK, right-- HERNANDEZ: --work is supporting-- CARLSON: --OK. HERNANDEZ: --did you know that-- CARLSON: But-- HERNANDEZ: --that the United Nations-- CARLSON: --what? There's nothing the United-- HERNANDEZ: --is out there right now -- CARLSON: --Nations does matters to me or surprises me-- HERNANDEZ: --volunteers and helping people-- CARLSON: --but let me - hold on - let me just ask you-- HERNANDEZ: --get here through the Caravan. CARLSON: --I'm trying to take you seriously. You said most of them in this - the first Caravan are coming from Honduras. What war specifically are you talking about that the United States promoted? Whose interests were benefiting from that war? And when did that war end? What are you talking about specifically? HERNANDEZ: Specifically, look at the - the role of the U.S. government in Honduras. I mean-- CARLSON: OK. HERNANDEZ: --we can go here all day-- CARLSON: --right, what war are you talking-- HERNANDEZ: --all night but we don't have that much time-- CARLSON: --about? HERNANDEZ: --so, I want to make sure that-- CARLSON: Well just give me the war and tell me-- HERNANDEZ: --you understand-- CARLSON: --when it ended. HERNANDEZ: --that the -- CARLSON: I'm trying. HERNANDEZ: --that - OK, let me ask you this. Have you - do you know of any involvement of the U.S. in Honduras? CARLSON: So, you - you - what you're saying is-- HERNANDEZ: Do you know of any involvement of U.S.-- CARLSON: --you don't really know what you're - hold on, what-- HERNANDEZ: --in El Salvador-- CARLSON: --what you're saying is you don't really know what you're talking about-- HERNANDEZ: --in Nicaragua? CARLSON: --but you're throwing out a talking point-- HERNANDEZ: Oh then you need to do -- CARLSON: --designed-- HERNANDEZ: --then we need to have a show-- CARLSON: --OK, so-- HERNANDEZ: --just to talk about the U.S.-- CARLSON: --OK, Roberto-- HERNANDEZ: --government's involvement-- CARLSON: --I'm trying, I'm trying-- HERNANDEZ: --in Central America-- CARLSON: --I'm asking you - hold on, stop-- HERNANDEZ: --and the rest of Latin America-- CARLSON: --I'm asking you, specifically, what war in Honduras are you talking about that the United States inspired that justifies this migrant Caravan? What war? When did that war end? What year? What are you talking about? HERNANDEZ: OK-- CARLSON: Or do you not know? HERNANDEZ: What? I do, OK? Let's look at the role of the military of the U.S. currently in Honduras. CARLSON: No, but you said there was a war. So, you're totally ignorant of the history of Honduras, but you are lecturing us about our responsibility to let these people in because of a war that we started but you can't tell us what war or what year it ended. I think that's what you're saying. HERNANDEZ: And the - and - not only that but it's the involvement of the U.S. in-- CARLSON: OK. HERNANDEZ: --Honduras and Central America. CARLSON: OK. HERNANDEZ: We've talked about-- CARLSON: OK. So, obviously, history's not your subject. HERNANDEZ: --this before. And you and I don't disagree -- CARLSON: Let's - let's go to something-- HERNANDEZ: --and that's fine with me. CARLSON: --OK -- HERNANDEZ: But, you know, the fact is-- CARLSON: --I'm not sure we're disagreeing. I've - I - I think I don't really know-- HERNANDEZ: --that the United Nations currently is supporting-- CARLSON: --what you're talking about. HERNANDEZ: --this-- CARLSON: Right, OK. United Nations-- HERNANDEZ: --Caravan. Why would the-- CARLSON: --yes, OK, I'm sure they are-- HERNANDEZ: --United Nations be supporting and helping-- CARLSON: I - not account by -- HERNANDEZ: --these people? And then Trump goes-- CARLSON: --can't imagine why the U.N. does a lot of things-- HERNANDEZ: --and - and says that - that the-- CARLSON: --OK. HERNANDEZ: --U.S. should-- CARLSON: Right, got it. HERNANDEZ: --stop Mexico-- CARLSON: Let me ask you-- HERNANDEZ: --from letting these people come here. CARLSON: --all right. Let me, well we're -- HERNANDEZ: Mexico-- CARLSON: --we're going to change the category to the - to the 200-- HERNANDEZ: --let these people through-- CARLSON: --category, let's see if you can answer this, OK? San Francisco has now announced that illegal aliens, people who have no right to be here, will be allowed to vote in local school board elections. You live in the city. You think this is a great idea. Do you think Americans who sneak into other people's countries ought to be allowed to vote in their elections? HERNANDEZ: Well, let's look at how many White people live in Mexico, the Mexican government doesn't harass them. But let's - let's look at how many people-- CARLSON: Are they allowed to vote in elections? HERNANDEZ: --did - look how many people did not vote in this last election? Look, look at the numbers. CARLSON: OK. I would say as a performance artist-- HERNANDEZ: OK. So-- CARLSON: --you're - you're talented. But I just want to get a one straight answer. Are Americans who sneak into other people's countries without permission allowed - do they have a right to vote in those countries' elections? Do I have a right to sneak into Mexico and announce that I get to vote there? And if you don't let me, you're a racist. Is that a human right that I possess? HERNANDEZ: So, let's get it clear. In San Francisco, these individuals that are being allowed to vote are only voting for the election, for the members of the Board of Education-- CARLSON: Oh, another question unanswered-- HERNANDEZ: --and these-- CARLSON: --all right. HERNANDEZ: --these people, right, should have the-- CARLSON: OK. HERNANDEZ: --right to vote-- CARLSON: I got it. HERNANDEZ: --specifically for-- CARLSON: Right. HERNANDEZ: --those who are going to make-- CARLSON: OK. HERNANDEZ: --policies and decisions affecting-- CARLSON: I get it. HERNANDEZ: --their children. CARLSON: OK. So, I asked you a couple simple questions. You - you couldn't come up with an answer. Text me later if those answers come to you. OK, Roberto? I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Victor Davis Hanson lives in California as well. He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution in the Bay Area, and he joins us tonight. So, it does raise, I think-- VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: Hi, Tucker. CARLSON: --I mean, tell me if I'm overstating the importance of this, but California allowing illegal aliens to vote in school board elections can be written off as it's just a school board. But how philosophically is that different from letting them vote in any other election? HANSON: Well it's the - it's the beginning of the erosion of the federal electoral laws we saw with sanctuary cities. But it - it's part of a message that we're sending. If you have 500 jurisdictions where Immigration law doesn't apply, and you start allowing people to vote in local then it might be state and eventually federal, it sends a message to these Caravans that there's already 22 million people here who came illegally. There's another 40 million who came illegally and it's a place-- CARLSON: Right. HANSON: --where if you get across illegally, you're going to be able to function as a citizen. And then we don't - they have a lot more - the Caravan people have a lot more strategic assessment, much more astute than we do. They have - the governments of Central America and Mexico gets $60 billion in their remittances. They want it. Employers, it's a boom economy, they need cheap labor. The identity politics, as your guest illustrated, they want them, and Democratic Party want. The only people who want to follow the law are your viewers, the ordinary voters without a lot of clout. But I think they understand that there's only two ways to stop them once they get here, Tucker. You either have to have a wall or you have to use force. 800 soldiers or even the Border Patrols we saw with Mexico when they crash through is not going to stop them. You need three divisions. CARLSON: Right. HANSON: So, we don't have a wall. And the optics of - of using tear gas or rubber bullets will be as bad as children being separated and that's what they're counting on. CARLSON: Exactly. HANSON: What we need is what every country in the world throughout history - Saudi Arabia has a 500-mile wall. Israel has a wall. Greece, Turkey, Eastern Europe, then it changes the dialectic and it makes them try to come through a physical barrier, and they have to be the aggressor. And then usually the people who might get through are going to be young males who are easily more deportable than women and children. But we say to them, \"Here's our wall. We - we don't - we don't want to oppress you. Just stay on your side.\" But if we don't have a wall then we have to be pre-emptive and have the whole messy use of force and they count on that. And I think-- CARLSON: So what-- HANSON: --that's what's behind it and I'm not-- CARLSON: --so the-- HANSON: --optimistic. CARLSON: --the-- HANSON: I'm op-- CARLSON: --no, I'm not optimistic at all. But I also wonder this is not the end but the beginning. These migrants are claiming refugee status because of political instability in Central America. But by recent historical standards, things are relatively peaceful in Central America. What if there really is a revolution or another Civil War or a natural disaster in any of these countries, could we potentially get an enormous wave, like a real wave, tens, hundreds of thousands-- HANSON: Yes, I - I think we are -- CARLSON: --of people on our Southern border. HANSON: Well I live in a state where one out of every four people was not born in the United States, and not all of them - about only 60 percent are legal, and this is the time when we've rejected assimilation, integration, inter-marriage, the inner - the melting pot, and have opted for the identity politics sellable. CARLSON: Right. HANSON: So, we are getting into a tribal society. And one final thing about your speaker, he said that this Western civilization in California is sort of an artificial construct. But they have many alternatives of indigenous people. They can make a left turn and go south into Oaxaca and enjoy an indigenous person's paradise. CARLSON: Yes. HANSON: But they're going into an artificial civilization, according to the speaker, that they should detest because he says it's antithetical to the Native American experience. But when, you know, when we - when we formed California, there were only 15,000 Mexican nationals in this huge state. It was almost empty. So this myth that there were millions of indigenous people here then they were displaced by so-called White Europeans is - is historically inaccurate. And we didn't have these-- CARLSON: Well, of - of course. HANSON: --discussions when we believed in the melting pot and we had secure borders and legal measured meritocratic -- CARLSON: Wow. HANSON: --and diverse immigration. CARLSON: Of course. And many Mexican nationals are themselves-- HANSON: Yes. CARLSON: --the descendants of European conquistadors who oppressed the indigenous population. HANSON: Absolutely. CARLSON: So, it's a lot more complicated than we're pretending, as-- HANSON: Absolutely. CARLSON: --you well know. Professor, thank you. Great to see you, as always. HANSON: Thank you. CARLSON: Well Democrats have been promising America a Blue Wave for months. Are they going to get it? Some of their wackier candidates may be slothing that wave down. Lisa Boothe has been taking a careful look at those candidates and she joins us after the break. We're, of course, also monitoring the President's rally now ongoing in Charlotte, North Carolina. Stay tuned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: --stop Catch-and-Release, end the Visa Lottery that we talked about, end chain migration. And we will keep the criminal drug dealers and terrorists the hell out of our country. (CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Mid-term elections less than two weeks away, Democrats have raised unprecedented amounts of money, really, historic amounts. There're also historic levels of voter enthusiasm among Democrats. And the party hopes that all of that will propel a metaphorical Blue Wave. Only one thing stands in the way at this stage, the quality of some of their candidates. It's low. Consider Law Professor Katie Porter, she's a Democrat running for Congress in a basically Republican-leaning district in Orange County, California. The Washington Free Beacon has published documents that Porter submitted to a progressive activist group. And those documents show she supports the creation of something called The Department of Peacebuilding, dude, as well as reparations for African-Americans and lots of other Left-wing ideas that most people think are stupid. In Arizona, meanwhile, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, treated by the press as a real candidate, has lost the endorsement of the State Troopers Association, after the members revolted against her candidacy. Sinema has been caught faking key aspects of her biography. She's also called her state, \"The meth lab of democracy,\" welcome to Arizona, and said on a radio show in 2003 that she did not care if Americans joined the Taliban. She's a lot of fun. Lisa Boothe is a senior fellow at the Independent Women's Voice. And she joins us tonight. Lisa, thanks a lot-- LISA BOOTHE, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE SENIOR FELLOW: Hi, Tucker. CARLSON: --for coming on. So, first to this candidate in Orange County, California, is she in step with the voters of this district, would you say? BOOTHE: No, she's absolutely not. And that's what's so crazy about the fact that this race is so competitive because, as you mentioned, this is Orange County. Clinton did win the district by-- CARLSON: Right. BOOTHE: --5.4 percent. But this has been a traditionally Republican-leaning district. However, Katie Porter says that Elizabeth Warren is her mentor. This is someone she admires. You go to the list of endorsements on her website. It's EMILY's List, Planned Parenthood, anti-gun groups, every progressive organization you can think of. So, she is absolutely out of step with her district. She wants single-payer. She supports Bernie Sanders' single-payer system plan that would also give healthcare to illegal immigrants. She supported California becoming a sanctuary state. So, you just go through the policy that she supports and it is entirely inconsistent with the district that she's seeking to represent. CARLSON: Can you be a lot more specific about the Department of Peacebuilding? Would there be a Peacebuilding SEAL team that would go out and create peace by force? Or did she put meat on those bones? BOOTHE: I don't know. It doesn't sound like a very dangerous group to be a part of though. So, unlike the SEAL Team Six where, you know, you go through rigorous training and yes, so, I'm not-- CARLSON: Standards are lower for peacebuilding-- BOOTHE: --I don't know much about -- CARLSON: --OK. BOOTHE: I think so-- CARLSON: So-- BOOTHE: --yes. CARLSON: --so, it seems like a big deal in the Arizona Senate race for any professional organization or a union to withdraw an endorsement this close to an election. How did this happen with the State Troopers and Kyrsten Sinema? BOOTHE: It is a big deal because this is the thing. She's been running on the endorsement to kind of bolster her law enforcement and also on immigration issues, essentially, border security. So, this is a big deal for her. And what happened is the group put out the endorsement and then found out that some members were not so happy about it. So now, they're deciding to be neutral in this race. And I think the border security issue is really big because Kyrsten Sinema has also been part of this group called No More Deaths where she was part of a group that helped and aided illegal immigrants in trying to cross the border. And this group has said about U.S. Border Patrol that they engaged in a systematic - systematic torture. So, this is a group that's been very critical of border security. And she has also compared illegal immigrants' deaths to that of or troops dying. So, this group's been kind of wacky and she's supported in the past. And clearly, what she's been trying to do is run from all these comments that have come back to haunt her as she's been trying to position herself as a moderate in this Senate race. CARLSON: Yes. Those remarks comparing the deaths of illegal aliens in the desert to our troops in Iraq really were pretty far out. I don't think that we're shading those who are taking them out of context. That was pretty unbelievable. BOOTHE: Well, and-- CARLSON: Lisa Boothe, thank you. BOOTHE: --sure. CARLSON: You've been on this for us. And I appreciate that. And I hope we'll see you again next week for more updates. BOOTHE: Thanks for having me, Tucker. I appreciate it. CARLSON: Well does your right to free speech include your right to have views that organized Islamic groups don't think you should be allowed to have? Well European Court has ruled on that. Sharia speech codes have come to Europe. We're not overstating it. That happened. And we have details. Of course, Europe isn't the only place where freedom of speech is threatened. Sadly, in America, our leaders don't support it either. The social justice Left, authoritarians in Silicon Valley wage war on speech every single day, and they are winning. We are sad to tell you. That's addressed at great length in a new book called Ship of Fools, available for purchase TuckerCarlson.com. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: A European Court has determined that a Muslim's right not to be offended takes priority over the majorities' right to free speech. That's not an interpretation. They said that out loud. Here's the case. An Austrian woman was convicted of \"Disparaging religion.\" She was fined more than $500. Her crime was suggesting that Muhammad's marriage to a six-year old constituted a form of pedophilia. She claimed her comments were protected by the freedom of speech because she is a European. And traditionally, they would have been. But things have changed now. The European Court of Human Rights disagrees with her. They affirmed her conviction. They said that they needed to balance her quote, right to freedom of expression with the right of others to have their religious feelings protected. Brendan O'Neill is Editor of Spiked Online, and a columnist for Reason Magazine, and he joins us tonight. Brendan, thanks for coming on. Just as a factual matter, did I misstate any of that? I mean are those the facts of the case? BRENDAN O'NEILL, SPIKED ONLINE EDITOR: Those are the facts of the case. It's pretty shocking. In 2009, this woman, whose name is not being given out in public, she gave a seminar in Austria in which she said that Muhammad behaved like a pedophile. And she was charged with inciting religious hatred. And she appealed to the European Court of Human Rights believing that a - a Court of Human Rights might actually defend her rights. But the European Court of Human Rights has decreed that the Court was right to punish her for making these comments. And furthermore, the European Court of Human Rights establishes precedent across Europe. So, we now have effectively being warned, all Europeans, that you are forbidden from making this comment about Muhammad. CARLSON: So, in other words, a standard that has long prevailed in the Islamic world, which is that you can be punished for criticizing Muhammad, is now the law in Europe? O'NEILL: Exactly right. And I think this is pretty terrifying because what we are witnessing in Europe is the return of Blasphemy Law by the back door. You know, people fought long and hard in many European countries for the right to question religion, to mock gods, to make fun of prophets. This is a long hard for - fought for liberty. It's now being overturned by these new forms of Blasphemy Law, which really are rehabilitating quite medieval laws, which tell us that there are certain things about religious gods and prophets that we are not allowed to say. I think it is a brazen and terrifying attack on freedom of speech. CARLSON: Yes. And one specific legitimate I - I assume you're still free to attack the Archbishop of Canterbury-- O'NEILL: Well-- CARLSON: --in fact, of course, you are. It's Islam. So, but let me ask you this, the guardians of the First Amendment in any society, of course, are journalists. I mean that's their role in a society. But my sense is the European press has not reacted like their house is burning down to this. They haven't raised a hue and cry over it. Or have I missed that? O'NEILL: They haven't. Not yet. I'm - I'm - I'm optimistic that something might happen because this is a pretty extreme case. But the problem we face in Europe, of course, is that Islam is offered the kind of protections that no other religion enjoys. We have the term Islamophobia, which is used against anyone who simply raises criticisms of the Quran or the hijab or any other aspect of Islamic practices or Islamic behavior. There's a real culture of conformism and censorship around the issue of Islam, in particular, which means that unfortunately many journalists probably will not take the tasks this court ruling in the way that they should. I think what we have to recognize is that freedom of speech, by its very definition, includes the freedom to offend. And what the Court has done has it has said that people's religious feelings trump the freedom of speech. I think that's a really dangerous road-- CARLSON: Right. O'NEILL: --to go down because nobody's feelings should trump the right of anyone else to say what they believe. CARLSON: Of course, but there's - and this is a much longer conversation, which maybe you come back and we could have, but it's not simply a failure to defend speech. It's also kind of continent-wide self-hatred. O'NEILL: Yes. CARLSON: What people are saying is the culture - our culture should bow down before another culture, minority culture, from another part of the world. I mean no - healthy society would not take this position, right? A society that hates-- O'NEILL: Yes. CARLSON: --itself would. O'NEILL: That's absolutely right. I think what we are doing is we are demolishing one of the key principles of modern Europe in the - in the wake of the Enlightenment and the-- CARLSON: Yes. O'NEILL: --Renaissance, Europe propelled itself forward and started to believe in freedom and choice and the right to express yourself. We are now backtracking on those great historic gains, and we are-- CARLSON: Yes. O'NEILL: --allowing a new form of censorship to come through. I also think it's a very dangerous ruling. We have many radical Islamists in Europe. And the court-- CARLSON: Right. O'NEILL: --has now basically said it is impermissible for people to say this thing about Muhammad. What message does that-- CARLSON: Exactly. O'NEILL: --send to these people? It tells them that if they hear someone say this, maybe they can punish them, maybe they can-- CARLSON: Well exactly-- O'NEILL: --reprimand them. CARLSON: --exactly. That's exactly-- O'NEILL: And exactly they-- CARLSON: --right. And-- O'NEILL: --in the way they did with Charlie Hebdo. I think this is green- lighting pretty violent responses to criticisms of Islam. CARLSON: Brendan, thank you. And I hope you will come back. Nice to have you. O'NEILL: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: NBC News and TIME Magazine both in effected PR for a Creepy Porn Lawyer, they hid facts about him. The public had a right to know. Why did they do that? We'll explain it to you next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) NBC and Time withheld stories that would have been damaging to creepy porn lawyer Michael Avenatti; reaction from progressive radio host Chris Hahn. CARLSON: Well, if you've got a television set in your house, you know perfectly well that the media have been celebrating Creepy Porn Lawyer as a Resistance hero for months and months now. But turns out they're not just celebrating him, but actively protecting him by withholding damaging information about him from you, the public. Two examples of this. Last June, Creepy Porn Lawyer told TIME Magazine that the Democrats absolutely needed to nominate a White man in 2020. Now, saying something like that would have instantly wrecked his political career. As a Democrat, there's nothing that offends Democrats more than that phrase. But have no fear, TIME did not tell you that. Democrats didn't know for months because they sat on the story. Meantime, Creepy Porn Lawyer became a national figure. NBC News, by the way, did exactly the same thing to even more political effect, when Creepy Porn Lawyer and, his client, Julie Swetnick, accused Brett Kavanaugh of participating in a long series of public gang-rapes. Remember that? Creepy Porn Lawyer presented a sworn statement from a second woman that seemed to back up some of Swetnick's claims. You probably vaguely recall this. Well two days after he released that sworn statement, the woman recanted the story to NBC News reporters. She said that CPL had \"Twisted her words.\" In other words, NBC News had credible information that dramatically undermined accusations against Brett Kavanaugh. Would have been nice to know that before the vote, but they didn't tell anybody. Huh? Are you surprised? Well only if you imagine NBC News was still a news organization and not a particularly clumsy arm of the Democratic Party which, needless to say, they are, because it was, of course, NBC that leaked the Access Hollywood tape to The Washington Post just before the presidential election, in order to influence the outcome of that election, and later protected Democratic donor and accused rapist Harvey Weinstein. They did all that. And yet, it wasn't enough for Creepy Porn Lawyer. Even with NBC's assistance, it has been a tough couple of weeks for him. His client Stormy Daniels was ordered to pay Donald Trump's legal fees. His theatrics during the Kavanaugh confirmation helped put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. Now the law firm, that he runs, is facing eviction for failing to pay its rent. He's still one of the best-known Democratic candidates for president though. How is he likely to do? Chris Hahn is a progressive radio host and a former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer. He joins us tonight from Long Island for a Creepy Porn Lawyer update. Chris, it's great to see you tonight. Thank you for bringing this up today. CHRIS HAHN, RADIO SHOW HOST: Great to see you, Tucker. CARLSON: So, here's my theory. So, Creepy Porn Lawyer makes baseless charges against Brett Kavanaugh, accusing him of participating in a rape. He says all of these lunatic things. He doesn't pay his taxes. He's obviously a discredited figure. And not one Democrat criticizes him until he endorses the idea of, and I'm quoting, \"A White man running for president,\" at which point all Democrats are like, \"Oh, no. It's over.\" It's over. Why didn't anyone note that before? HAHN: Hold on it. I have criticized him on this network several times and said he will never be the Democratic nominee for president. I do love his haircut. I think it's fantastic and very efficient. But I have criticized him politically. I think he is the reason why Susan Collins voted for Brett Kavanaugh because I thought the Swetnick allegations were very outrageous and hard to prove. That said, he had an affidavit from a client. He was not the one defaming the President or defaming Kavanaugh. It was the client. So, it is it - you know, look, there are lots of problems with him-- CARLSON: Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I'm - I'm sorry-- HAHN: --he will never - he's a sensationalist -- CARLSON: I - I agree with you up until there. But I just can't let you get away with the lawyer's dodge that it's the client. So, it was Creepy Porn Lawyer who brought these allegations forward, who took the deposition, who was the vehicle by which the rest of us know that these allegations were made. And, by the way, these allegations were taken with dead seriousness by every news organization in America, practically, not this show, but everybody else. And Democrats never said, \"Wait a second. 10 gang-rapes in a row? That's ridiculous.\" HAHN: I-- CARLSON: They stood and they nodded-- HAHN: I think a lot of -- CARLSON: --their heads, \"Oh, it's very serious.\" HAHN: --a lot of people took it, you know, took it less than serious, and a lot of people dismissed it and thought that this was adding something to what was some very credible allegations against Kavanaugh. And look, we call him Creepy Porn Lawyer because he-- CARLSON: Who are that made hold on, who were those people-- HAHN: --represented a porn star. CARLSON: --though? HAHN: He represented a-- CARLSON: Right. HAHN: --he represented - myself. He represented a porn star who we know was paid money not to discuss her affair with the President of the United States. So there is-- CARLSON: Wait, wait, hold on, no, wait, wait, hold on, wait, can I-- HAHN: --there, you know, that's why we know him as a-- CARLSON: --just - can I just ask you, wait hold on-- HAHN: --porn lawyer. CARLSON: --can I just ask a question. She took money for a voluntary sexual relationship in exchange for not talking about it. We used to call that extortion. HAHN: Yes, she did. CARLSON: Mafias specialized in it. But now we're totally cool with it. And we're blaming the guy who had to pay the extortion money. How does that work exactly? Are we for that now? HAHN: We don't - we actually don't know exactly how that money was proposed. In fact, it could have been proposed by the person who wanted to cover it up, not necessarily the porn star who wanted a cover story. CARLSON: Wait, wait, wait, so but you're-- HAHN: We never got to the bottom of that. CARLSON: --you're totally cool-- HAHN: And the President-- CARLSON: --with people-- HAHN: --the President's lawyers did settle the matter. So, I think they were happy with the arrangement. CARLSON: Oh? So they didn't want to talk about therefore they must be guilty. But just for the record, I want to get this on tape. You're totally cool if people have a consensual sexual relationship, and one of them gets- - HAHN: No. CARLSON: --money not to talk about it, that's OK with you? HAHN: I'm not. CARLSON: If that person breaks the agreement and talks about it anyway-- HAHN: No, look, look-- CARLSON: --it's the - it's the fault of the guy who-- HAHN: --look-- CARLSON: --paid her off not to talk about it, like what world is this? HAHN: --I am not - I am - I am not in favor of extortion. I was just pointing out-- CARLSON: Oh, OK. HAHN: --you're calling him a porn lawyer, we know why we call him a porn lawyer-- CARLSON: Well yes. HAHN: --we got to remember why he's a porn lawyer and who he represented. CARLSON: But look - not just-- HAHN: It wasn't like he was arguing for more money-- CARLSON: --a porn lawyer. If I could just correct you, no, no-- HAHN: --from the porn stations that-- CARLSON: --he's a Creepy-- HAHN: --right, sorry. CARLSON: --Porn Lawyer. Anyway just want him to clear that up. HAHN: Yes. CARLSON: Chris, thanks so much for clarifying all that, appreciate it. HAHN: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, former Trump Campaign Foreign Policy Advisor, George Papadopoulos now says that he was framed by the FBI. He may seek to undo a plea deal he entered into with Robert Mueller. Ed Henry has the latest for that, tonight. ED HENRY, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, I was there at Fox & Friends this morning when George Papadopoulos stunned us in this exclusive with Brian Kilmeade flat-out charging he was framed by the FBI that he may now seek to undo his plea deal with Robert Mueller and pursue a trial on what he called \"An entrapment case.\" That's a 180 degrees from the grand predictions in the media when Papadopoulos pled guilty one year ago this month to lying to the FBI. There were all kinds of reporters and pundits suggesting this was a bombshell, it would damage President Trump. Instead, Papadopoulos was sentenced to just 14 days in prison. His plea deal has not a whiff of collusion with Russians. And he emerged from his testimony on Capitol Hill Thursday declaring he's happy with how all of this has turned out, a far cry from last October when people in the media were declaring his cooperation with Mueller would prove to be bigger than the indictments against Paul Manafort, even though Trump aides have repeatedly said Papadopoulos was a low-level aide. Chris Cillizza of CNN insisting, \"But, what Papadopoulos has already admitted to doing, lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian operatives regarding dirt on Trump's general election opponent, is a very big deal. A bigger deal than the dozen counts laid out in the Manafort indictment.\" Well Papadopoulos' interview today raised more questions instead about whether President Trump's campaign was spied upon. Back in December, The New York Times published a story claiming it was Papadopoulos' 2016 meeting with an Australian diplomat that launched the FBI's counterintelligence probe without any help from the Clinton-financed dossier. Except, a more recent New York Times story said the FBI did not talk to the Australian diplomat until after that counterintelligence probe was already launched, and that there was surveillance of the Trump campaign. It even had a codename, Crossfire Hurricane, which Papadopoulos teed off on today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER: It seems completely suspicious at a week or so after Joseph Mifsud drops this information on me in London -- BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS: Unsolicited? PAPADOPOULOS: --unsolicited, then Alexander Downer apparently wants to figure out info on this particular topic. It just seems that it was some sort of a sting operation gone bad, to be quite honest with you (END VIDEO CLIP) HENRY: Republicans on the Hill believe this suggests the Special Counsel was launched based on trumped-up charges. Democrats continue to insist no, this is all about the President's allies trying to undermine Mueller's findings, which we now expect to come after the mid-terms. Tucker? CARLSON: Ed Henry, thanks for that. Democrats tell us they believe survivors, but not all survivors. We'll tell you which survivors they believe, after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We believe survivors. TED CRUZ, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, TEXAS: It was a delight. Excuse me. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Beto is way harder than you dude. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We believe survivors. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We believe survivors. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We believe survivors. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We believe survivors. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: God bless you Ted Cruz. CRUZ: Excuse me, let my wife through. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We believe survivors. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We believe survivors. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We believe survivors. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: The Democratic position on sexual harassment and assault is very simple. Believe women, all women at all times, in all cases, because women always tell the truth. They do not make false allegations ever. You cannot doubt them. Skepticism is hate. So with that standard in mind, we've been watching the Keith Ellison case pretty carefully. Ellison is, of course, the Democratic Congressman from Minnesota. He's running from - for Attorney General for Minnesota. His ex-girlfriend has accused him of physically abusing her because we do take women seriously. We asked her on the show to tell her story. Here's how she described the Democratic Party's response to her allegations. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAREN MONAHAN, KEITH ELLISON ACCUSER: If you look on social media, if you see some of the letters that have been written that basically say they don't believe me, the folks who have signed on you it's pretty apparent. There's been a lot of bullying. There's been a lot of harassment, isolation by many folks that I stood side by side with supporting them in their campaigns. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Democrats don't believe me, she said. Turns out, she was right. Just yesterday, the Chairman of the Minnesota Democratic Party put it this way. \"I don't believe her.\" So apparently, it's time to revise the believe-all-women rule. It turns out Democrats believe all women who make allegations that could be politically useful to them. The rest are ignored and attacked. That's the real rule. That's it for us tonight. Thanks for a great week. We'll be back 8 p.m. Monday night, the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have the best weekend.

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and a blueberry is her beach ball, Dana Perino. \"The Five.\" There's an old saying in media, if you don't have something nice to say, you'll do great. Luckily the press has Trump, so they never have anything nice to say. Eventually, this starts to become a problem. Since Trump got elected, doctors are seeing patients suffering from Trump Anxiety Disorder or TAD. The symptoms of TAD? Feeling like the world is ending. I wonder why? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) JOE SCARBOROUGH, CO-HOST, \"MORNING JOE\"/MSNBC: Donald Trump and his erratic behavior could be leading the United States towards World War III. JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\"/ABC: We're talking about annihilating millions of people. UNINDENTIFIED MALE, MSNBC: If this border wall happens it will be an unprecedented environmental catastrophe. JOHN AVLON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: We can't begin to normalize this. This is dangerous. This is childish. This is un-presidential. TREVOR NOAH, HOST, \"THE DAILY SHOW\"/COMEDY CENTRAL: This is it, the end of the presidential race and it feels like the end of the world. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No! (END VIDEO CLIPS) GUTFELD: Never gets old. But that's why you really can't mock the ill, when there's a whole industry selling them this kind of terror. As their go-to evil, the media has replaced climate change with Trump change. Everything bad in this world is now due to Trump, even as life improves. We've never been in a better spot with North Korea, GDP is going up, unemployment keeps shrinking. Optimism is higher than Willie Nelson. Yet if you listen to the other guys, the sky isn't just falling, it's already fallen and it can get up. It needs Life Alert. But as much as the chicken littles hate Trump, where would they be without him? Trump's election created a need that we didn't know we've had. The media has never been louder, celebrities have never been shoutier, academia has never been more strident. So haters, imagine if Trump were to disappear? How large a hole will there be in the lives of CNN and \"Morning Joe\" and Chelsea Handler? You think these people suffer from Trump anxiety? Wait until you see Trump withdrawal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS\"/E!) KIM KARDASHIAN: I wasted everyone's time. Everyone -- everything and I feel bad. You don't think I feel bad? (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: I know that. You can't go back after Donald. He's added something to politics that we haven't seen, which is speed -- not the drug, the energy. It's the first time in eight years so many in the media are sweating. Anxiety isn't from the apocalypse. It's from trying to keep up. All right, let's introduce. We have a new face here as a guest. Emily, welcome to the show. I know you've been on Jesse's program, but other quality shows, like mine. But I just thought maybe you say -- tell us a little bit about yourself. EMILY COMPAGNO, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah, thank you. So, first of all, thank you for having me here today. I'm really excited to be here, so thank you for that. And a little bit about myself, I'm a 12-year attorney and I still practice. I'm licensed in California and Washington. But the majority of my career was spent with the federal government and criminal law as well. And I've had the additional pleasure of cheering in the NFL while I was an attorney for the Oakland Raiders. And I went on a USO tour throughout Kuwait and Iraq visiting troops. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: That's so cool. COMPAGNO: . that really does remain, to this day, my greatest honor. There's me in one of the black hawks we flew around in which is an awesome way to travel. Oh, that's my. PERINO: I like that. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: You're doing so well. (LAUGHTER) COMPAGNO: And he chased a squirrel, right after that picture, by the way with that hat on. It's ridiculous. And this is my car. I drive a '72 Mach One, and Greg was telling me about his car before this show but I'm pretty sure my engine is bigger. GUTFELD: I think your engine is bigger. That's beautiful. Ah, '72, right? COMPAGNO: Yes. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: Yes, I have. PERINO: Do you drive that all around everywhere? COMPAGNO: I did in California and Seattle. It's harder. PERINO: Yeah. Does Seattle give you the stink eye when you drive around in that? COMPAGNO: Berkeley, I got more, you know, negative looks. But I think in Seattle, I just. PERINO: Beautiful car. GUTFELD: Yeah, you just run over those Prius', that's what I would do. What do you make of this whole idea of anxiety? Could this be a massive class action lawsuit against Trump? COMPAGNO: Well, they could certainly try, right? We saw the class action suit about caffeine and coffee in California. But I just feel like it's one more thing where the reality is that people want to be outraged or affected rather than informed, right? The whole thing is ridiculous. And we're seeing now that this -- to me, also, it's another oversimplification of the matter. Oh, I have this Trump anxiety syndrome, and so that must mean X, Y, and Z. Well, what is that the root of, right? Fear and fright is usually from lack of education. So, if we could talk about things more engaged and indicial manner, people probably wouldn't be so frightened of positive news coming out of the administration. GUTFELD: You know, Juan, to paraphrase a stoic, if you're offended, you're complicit in the outrage. Got that from our producer. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: That was good. GUTFELD: Yeah, very good. So, it means, it's like Donald's isn't really making you sick. It's -- you're letting him get you sick, right? It's like you have to learn how to manage the emotions and turn it into something productive, correct? WILLIAMS: Is that right? Because I think Donald plays on emotions every day. I mean, he plays on the fear factor. He likes to stir up his base with fear. He likes to mock people and intimidate people. But here's the thing, you can even make fun of Trump derangement syndrome. GUTFELD: Right. WILLIAMS: But I think that -- look at it from the Democrats point of view, Greg. That's -- the base is anti-Trump and energized to turn out in the midterms. And all the numbers right now are flowing towards the Democrats because the Democratic base is so energized. GUTFELD: Right. WILLIAMS: They are upset about Trump. GUTFELD: Deranged. WILLIAMS: You say why things are going so great. Hey, people look around and say, you know what, this country is in a place I've never seen it before. I don't even recognize it in some cases, and they're outraged. GUTFELD: But that's a -- again, a psychological problem. WILLIAMS: Why? You can't just speak the truth? GUTFELD: Well, no, it's psychological. I mean, if you look at the job numbers and the economy, those are real -- you know, real progress. You're talking about the real serious psychological problems. People think there's something wrong when there's something good going on. WILLIAMS: Yeah, look at the taxes. Oh, gees. We're going to give a tax cut to the working men of Americana and it goes to nobody but the rich. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Fake news, Juan. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Check with the rich. WATTERS: I think what happen is Trump was elected not to bring continuity, and to not, you know, guide the country along the path it was going. Donald Trump was elected to grab America by the back of the neck and then yank it from off the edge of the cliff. For some people that's very thrilling. GUTFELD: Yeah. WATTERS: And for some people that's incredibly jarring. And I think those people are mentally weak. I mean, we had generations had stormed the beaches, and now they're crying in the streets. So, I think it's because the media is so negative, and the media is constantly saying the sky is falling, and people can't process that. It's also because Trump is constantly battling everybody. He's taking down institutions. He's fighting with people. He's on twitter. And we've never had a president like that before and people can't process that. And then, three, people are frustrated because they haven't been able to take him down. They've thrown everything at this guy and he's still at 45 to 46 percent. And for them, that's incredibly frustrating and they need to see a shrink. GUTFELD: You know, Dana, let's say you are the shrink. PERINO: OK. GUTFELD: And I come in and I go I have all this anxiety over Donald Trump. He's driving me crazy. What kind of advised would you give me? PERINO: All right. I would say it depends -- are you an action oriented person or you're somebody who need to just turn off the TV and turn off twitter? I know people that are just like I don't like to watch the news anymore. It's too negative. Or especially if it was violent, you know, they don't want to watch that. So you do have a choice. You know it's been the serenity prayer, you ask for wisdom for the things you cannot change and the courage to know the difference and the things that you can't. And so, I think that -- the other thing is, and I do think the Democrats have done this at large extent, and so have Trump supporters, which is channel that energy into something else. Run for office, donate, decide to turn something into action so that you can actually get involved. If you feel like you're more involved and you're actually being able to do something on either side, then you can deal with your anxiety better. But more is probably, I think, getting on twitter is probably good. GUTFELD: I do think there's something -- to what Jesse said, Emily, which is like -- I think the stress, actually, is real and it's not -- it's has to do with time compression. The fact that because Trump has packed like five incidents into one day it's like you'll be a politician with something controversial once a week, but it seems like he just -- it's like to him news is shuffleboard, like if there's a news item, he'll hit that one out with another news item. So we are just constantly racing and racing, and I can kind of see where that gets exhausting, even for us. WATTERS: Yeah. COMPAGNO: Well, sure. The rapidity of the media cycle can certainly be exhausting. But, also, I feel like part of the issue is focusing on that fright and the fear of what hasn't happened yet. And we're ignoring then to our detriment the negatives that still aren't face. So, you know, we're just talking about California. Well, that still has the highest poverty rate if you take into account cost of living. And yet we have 125, approximately, billionaires living in that state. GUTFELD: Yeah. COMPAGNO: . with $500 billion-plus among them. And then, L.A. County just leveraged, what, you know, $430 million worth of debt to combat the homeless problem that is growing by the day. So, it's almost a shell game where we are focused on what this media, on the headlights, the oversimplification, and then ignoring what really needs our attention. GUTFELD: I'm stealing those stats when I do Tucker later. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: Juan, the media and Hollywood shares some responsible for this, I think, because they're the ones that are keeping it at a doomsday level, and they're going to fork out millions. Now, a lot of people in Hollywood are going to fork out millions in the midterms, obviously, with the hope to win both houses and impeach. Is that the realistic goal, you think? WILLIAMS: No. But I think -- I think, realistically, they have a shot at the house if that's what you're asking. But, you know, I'm struck by this conversation because to me, you say it's the Hollywood elite, it's the media, it's everybody but Donald Trump. But I think if I'm anxious, if the American people are anxious, and according to what I saw. GUTFELD: I agree with you. WILLIAMS: They are more anxious. Apparently you can measure this, right? And they are more anxious. But what about Donald Trump's repeated lies? What about the idea he stands next to Putin like a submissive puppy and says, oh, I believe Putin, not the Americans. Wait a second, what side is this guy on? I thought he was our president. WATTERS: Well, I don't know. I think people are more resilient on the right than people on the left. During the Obama administration, there is, you know, racial riots, there was a lot of domestic terror attacks, there are gas price spikes, there was premium spike with the healthcare situation. There was a lot of uncertainty and volatility during that time. Conservatives didn't rush to see a shrink. You know what they did? They had a drink and went to work the next day. GUTFELD: So they created the tea party. WATTERS: And they translated that into votes. PERINO: And there was ISIS, remember? GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: That was a little bit of anxiety producing, and you're worried about the future of the world. The other thing I would say is part of this is that the celebrities in Hollywood have said they're going to be more engaged now than ever. GUTFELD: You're right. PERINO: The thing is that the president -- yes, for President Trump, he does better if he has someone or something to work against. So, I actually think if Hollywood really wanted to help the Democrats, it would be better just to sit back, write checks, and register new voters rather than giving him something to run against. GUTFELD: That's what Clooney -- Clooney say he wouldn't hang around Obama because he didn't want to tarnish Obama with the Hollywood, you know, stench. PERINO: They just met behind closed doors. GUTFELD: Exactly. All right, President Trump and his legal team launched a new wave of attacks against Robert Mueller and Michael Cohen. The war of words, that's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: President Trump ramping up his attacks on what he calls the rigged witch hunt, and his legal team is now saying there's no chance Trump is going to sit down for an interview with the special counsel. Rudy Giuliani making the rounds on TV today, though, going after Robert Mueller and Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Here are some of the highlights. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: My client didn't do it. Even if he did, it's not a crime. And I've said that over and over. Collusion is not a crime. No, on the sit down until we get -- we get exactly what they want to do. We'll advise the president -- he decides. And he's always leaned in favor of doing it. Right now, I'm telling him no way. We're not going to do it. They're interfering with the ability to govern. It's a horrible thing that Mueller is doing. You tell me a lawyer is taping his clients. I've got to say, sorry, I've made a mistake. The guy is unethical. He's a scumbag. He's a horrible person. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right. So, Greg, Rudy is off the leash today. GUTFELD: He's off the leash and he's got a little dog in his jaws. (LAUGHTER) WATTERS: What do you make about the timing and the strategy behind turning loose Rudy? GUTFELD: Well, it's interesting. It's like -- it's a mess that the more you clean it, the messier it gets. It's like Rudy's strategy is he sees this spill on the carpet and dumps a wheelbarrow of soup over it. But this is part of the package you get from Queens. Trump is from Queens. Nothing goes down without a fight. Nothing goes down without name calling. This isn't Brentwood, Bel Air, or Madison, Wisconsin. These are New Yorkers. You've got Giuliani, you've got Trump. PERINO: And Michael Cohen. GUTFELD: And Michael Cohen. I mean, this is the streets of New York and New Jersey. It's like -- we are now watching an ongoing episode of The Sopranos. WILLIAMS: Wow. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Did you mean that as a complement? GUTFELD: Yes, I did. Because I don't believe -- I'm very skeptical of the attention that's being devoted to this. And so, I can't take it seriously. When the if's become ours, then I will take it seriously. Right now it's just background noise. WILLIAMS: I'll give you some ours. GUTFELD: OK. WILLIAMS: So Giuliani said, this is just a few months ago. GUTFELD: Yeah. WILLIAMS: Cohen is an honest guy I trust. GUTFELD: Yeah. WILLIAMS: Now he says. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: . this guy -- I don't even want to repeat what he just said. But, you know, he thinks he's a lowlife. WATTERS: Because he taped the president. WILLIAMS: No, no, on a host of issues here, Jesse. He thinks that the guy is a lowlife. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: He keeps changing his story. Greg, would you want Rudy representing you? GUTFELD: Juan, this is how life works. Somebody is your lowlife until they're no longer your lowlife. Then they're just a lowlife. But everybody -- yeah, he's my jerk. He's a jerk, but he's my jerk. That's how they look at lawyers. There's no -- sorry, Emily. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: She just looked at me like. WILLIAMS: Take it easy. This is full combat. MMA of debates. WATTERS: As a lawyer, what do you think about this? Do you think it's just a P.R. game that they're playing and trying to discredit the Mueller investigation by saying all of these things were happening? He stacked the deck with a lot of Democratic lawyers. Mueller has a conflict. I'm not going to be treated fairly. So when the investigation does come to a conclusion, there's a lot of doubt in the air. COMPAGNO: That's absolutely one argument for sure, but there's also been a lot of question as to -- well, is there even a strategy, right? And certainly what we saw today might be evidence that it's more of a reactionary one even though it's always trying to get in front of the new cycle, in front of the statement to put out there with the narrative should be and that's partly, for example, this -- you know, should he sit down with Mueller, should he not. Well, that's in part the strategy behind that would be to help frame that sculpted frame then that narrative, but, obviously, has a lot more potential for detriment than not. And I think if I could throw in my two cents about Cohen, you know, obviously, everyone keeps repeating, well, it's a one party consent state in New York, sure. His lawyer says, well, he recorded all of his conversations because it replaced him taking notes, right? And because there's so many -- there's almost 200, that speaks to that, but you still have a duty of confidentiality to your client, which is a broader duty than privilege, for example. So, you never release it and you never - - you essentially vow not to do harm to your client with their confidence they've given you. And they also begged the question so the privilege was waived by that tape and I think that was a smart move because, A, the conversation doesn't continue about, well, there must be something in that tape and there must be something recorded that's nefarious. And also, because it takes out the fight the government could have argued, A, it is privilege, or, B, then there's a crime fraud exception. So, I certainly think that was wise, but I also think that this, either purposeful or not strategy of being mired in the details, it's a little bit taking us away from the bigger picture. WILLIAMS: Well, Giuliani says he wants now all the tapes to be heard. He thinks it helps the president if all the tapes are heard. But I've got to think as I'm sitting here, you know, people -- Giuliana comes out and, for example, he says, yes, we paid off Stormy -- oh, the president knew about that. Now we learn the president knew about Karen McDougal and that thing. You think is he helping this president? WATTERS: I just think it's less about the Cohen thing and it's more about Mueller. And now we believe the Mueller thing, if we are to believe Rudy Giuliani, may conclude around September, and the president doesn't want to talk to him it looks like at this point. PERINO: Well, no, that's not what they said. Rudy Giuliani says he does not want his client to talk to him, but that the president still has always maintained that he wants to talk to him, but all of his advisors are saying no. And now, Rudy Giuliani is a hard pass, like not going to happen. I also feel like Mueller might be about -- I don't know -- completely wrapping up, but it feels to me like every time we get to this sort of ramped up rhetoric. WATTERS: Something else. PERINO: . something is coming. And it might be another indictment that you might see, you know, soon. I'm not going to say what I think maybe could happen, I don't know. WATTERS: Oh, Dana, now you have to say it. PERINO: Not going to say it. But here's the other thing about Cohen, this is what's really gross, -- what he used to do is -- let's say that he -- you would say, oh, you mind if I tape this? And I'm like, OK, I won't tape it anymore. Pushed it off and put it under -- and he had another device that was recording you the entire time. So, I think, that if you want to be sympathetic towards somebody, like, even President Trump, if you don't like him, like that is pretty underhanded for -- of what you were just saying, Emily, like for a lawyer to do that. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Also remember, why did the southern district of New York go to his hotel room, knock on the door and say we've got to get all these stuff, because they have a tip that he was about to destroy evidence. And I imagine that the tapes were probably on the list. GUTFELD: But Cohen. WATTERS: At least he didn't deleted all those emails. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: I don't think Cohen was hired for his credibility, do you think? (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: Everybody has got to have a fixer. WATTERS: That's right. You know what? Emily is a fixer. Up next, President Trump making a major threat against the Democrats who don't want to build the wall. Wait until you hear this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: It's border wall or bust for President Trump. He's now doubling down on his threat to shut down the federal government if Democrats don't agree to fund his wall. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As far as the border is concerned and, personally, if we don't get border security, after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would have no problem doing a shutdown. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: But some on the left not budging on the wall. Staunch anti- Trump critic, Representative Maxine Waters is launching this new attack on the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: This president is a bully, and he'll try to intimidate all of us. He's not going to shutdown anything. As a matter fact, people will remember that he said he was going to build this wall and he was going to make Mexico pay for the wall. They said they weren't going to pay for anything. Now he wants the American citizens to pay for this wall. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Waters to Watters, answer? I thought Mexico was paying for this thing? WATTERS: They still will. Just be patient, Juan. WILLIAMS: OK. WATTERS: And it's going to cost a lot of pesos because the wall will be built. It will be beautiful. But it looks like it's going to be built one step at a time. WILLIAMS: Oh, is that it. WATTERS: We've had a deal for 25 billion in an exchange for legalizing dreamers. Then we have the S-hole countries comment, and the shutdown- Schumer situation. They didn't want chain migration and lotto thrown in there, so it fell apart. I don't think the senate is going to do this because it takes 60 votes. They can get it through the house but not through the senate. And a shutdown during the middle of the fall, there's a whole hand grenade in there. You've got to confirm Cavanaugh. You've got to run for reelection. I don't even think McConnell wants the wall. He's not a wall guy. And I don't think Ryan wants his lasting, you know, swan song to be a government shutdown, you know, and then losing the house. So, I don't think it's going to happen. But, you know, if the Democrats take the house, I mean, they're not only not going to fund the wall, they're going to abolish ICE, so be careful. WILLIAMS: Did you just say it's not going to happen? WATTERS: I don't believe it's going to happen at this point right now. WILLIAMS: OK. WATTERS: But they're going to have to fund it small piecemeal. WILLIAMS: So, Emily, so what you get is a situation where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says I'm not having a vote on this before the midterms, and Ron Johnson, head of homeland security, says it's a bad idea. And people in the house are saying, hey, we're Republicans but we're not into this. What do you make of it? COMPAGNO: Well, I agree with Jesse, and I also -- I personally -- I really don't like the threat of a government shutdown or using that as a tool. First of all, we're not really getting much out of a lot people there anyway, and, secondly, you know, as a federal attorney, I was a managing attorney and an acting director, so I've handed out papers. And the amount of resources it takes to prepare for a furlough and execute on it and then have backup after, it is inordinate. And so, to me, it's just a tremendous hemorrhage, again, of those resources. And also, I feel like -- you know we've talked about this but the southern border issue, we cannot overstate or underestimate the power that -- of the corruption in Mexico, and the Central American countries, and the transnational drug cartels. Almost 150 politicians have been murdered in Mexico ramping up to their election, and then five since their election this month. And so, to men, again, if we could just have a little bit more dialogue I think from those border or the districts along the border by those reps, by those southern border senators and have a more engaging conversation in detail, then we can get out of that hyperbole, especially coming up to the midterm election. If we can have a collective, cohesive strategy on that with the facts at hand, those -- all those push factors, that would be way more fruitful than just this kind of volleying back and forth about it. WILLIAMS: Dana, tell us about the politics here, because it sounds like Republicans think the politics are not good heading into the midterms. PERINO: Well, they're not exactly sure. So remember, the Democrats started to shut down the government, and then they, you know, got -- they touched the hot stove and, like, \"Oh, wait. Never mind.\" And there were all those embarrassing headlines, and the base -- the liberal base was very mad, saying, \"Why aren't you going to fight?\" And it's because they don't have anything to fight with. And the shutdown was just, like, a terrible idea. And President Trump absolutely won on that, and he was able to ride that for about eight weeks afterwards. So -- but is it different for President Trump? If he's going to shut down the government, could it turn out better for him? I don't know. He's got really good instincts on politics. He knows that the economy, as good as it is, is not what's driving voters to the polls. He needs to turn out his base. Will his base turn out for something like this? Possibly. The other thing about the politics is, I don't think that the members of Congress actually believe him. So they're like, \"Oh, he's just, like, threatening to shut down the government. He won't really do it.\" What I think the president should do, if he can, is to send up to the Congress the exact -- exactly what he would veto. And so that they know what they're dealing with so that they can try to get this done and avoid a government shutdown. But he might be just spoiling for a fight. WILLIAMS: He just wants a fight? PERINO: Maybe. WILLIAMS: You know, Mitch McConnell and the Republican leadership that they had a deal with the president not to shut down the government over this. And Greg, 60 percent of the American people plus say they don't want a wall. GUTFELD: You know, a government shutdown is the World Cup of politics. PERINO: Oh, it's the worst. GUTFELD: It's got all this -- there's this massive buildup: \"Here comes the World Cup.\" And then you turn it on, and it's boys just kicking a ball around. It's -- you know? And then it ends with penalty kicks. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: It's like, OK. Let's just skip the game and get to the penalty kicks. That's the same way, by the way, with the Supreme Court. It's like skip the hearings. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: Just get to the penalty kicks. Trump has had a lot of success so far in a year and a half, two years. But this is his birthday pony. Like, he's got GDP, unemployment, North Korea. But if he doesn't get that pony, he's not going to be happy. He wants the birthday pony. And he might already have it in the sense that what have we always said? Who's the wall? PERINO: He's the wall. GUTFELD: They wall was always a visual metaphor about an enhanced border security. He's made it an issue. People are listening. He -- you know, he's made it the issue that people weren't talking about. Maybe he'll get something out of it. WILLIAMS: Maybe he'll get something out of it. I think he's -- I think his strategy is \"I'm going to go after immigrants. I'm going to --\" This weekend he was going after the -- GUTFELD: Illegal immigrants. WILLIAMS: -- after the -- no, no, he wants to cut legal immigration. Don't forget that. WATTERS: He wants chain -- he wants chain over. Lotto over. He wants merit-based. WILLIAMS: Yes, and he wants to cut legal --- so I'm saying. WATTERS: Bring in the best and the brightest. WILLIAMS: Oh, please. WATTERS: And we don't bring in some guy's uncle from Zimbabwe. WILLIAMS: Oh, Zimbabwe. Thank you. WATTERS: Or Thailand, Juan. Take your pick. WILLIAMS: I get it. I want Norway, too. Norway, Norway. But the other part of it is -- GUTFELD: No way to Norway. WILLIAMS: -- goes after -- goes after the NFL players. GUTFELD: He wants to deport NFL players? When did this happen? WILLIAMS: Deport them? GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: No, no, he just wants to mock them and use it to stir up his base, like the immigration. GUTFELD: You just shifted. WILLIAMS: By the way, as a former cheerleader for the NFL, are you upset over Trump's attack on NFL players? GUTFELD: This is about the wall! This is about the wall! PERINO: The wall. GUTFELD: You are -- oh, my goodness. WILLIAMS: This is the wall. This is that wall. COMPAGNO: Right now, has paused any type of policy that they have, right, on kneeling during the anthem, which the -- we saw the Dolphins and then the Cowboys make their own policies. WILLIAMS: Yes. Jerry Jones, though, has now got his own policy. COMPAGNO: Exactly right. GUTFELD: How do you feel about Trump destroying ISIS, Juan? COMPAGNO: So I -- WILLIAMS: I wish it was true. GUTFELD: It is. COMPAGNO: It's become now a more polarized situation, and I think it did get too far at this point. But right now the NFL and the NFLPA are sitting down in front of an independent arbiter, and they are hopefully coming to an agreement behind closed doors. And that's all we need to focus on now, in terms of hoping that that's going to -- WATTERS: Can I say this? WILLIAMS: Yes. WATTERS: As an Eagles fan who hates the Dallas Cowboys, I love hearing those Cowboys players say, \"We're America's team, and we will not be kneeling; we will be standing.\" WILLIAMS: Good for them. All right. WATTERS: Go, Cowboys. Did I just say that? Oh, my God. PERINO: Bite your tongue. WATTERS: Where's the edit button? WILLIAMS: All right. A stunning number of millennials walking away from cushy jobs, and they don't even have a backup plan. What's going on? The surprising reason for this, straight ahead on \"THE FIVE.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: Talk about a workforce walkout. More and more self-described burned-out millennials are quitting their lucrative jobs and not worried about what they'll do next. Must be nice. A new survey says 43 percent of these young adults are ditching their careers after just two years to travel and have a better work-life balance. Only 28 percent plan to stay in their current jobs for more than five years. We are going to discuss. This is what I want to say. I'm kind of jealous and envious that they get to go and do all this. They have no cares in the world. They can just go travel, see the world while we're working here. But this is what I'm going to say. When you come back, do not expect to get the managerial position of a 26-year-old. You will start at the 22- year-old position. That is the entry-level one. Work experience is great. It gets you a lot of place. Travel experience is great, but it is not going to get you to leapfrog over people who stayed and worked. GUTFELD: Somebody is a little angry. PERINO: But you know how many calls I get a week asking me for mentoring advice? And I'll tell you, this is one of them. GUTFELD: Yes. No. 1, I'm very skeptical of stories like these when they have anecdotes. Like they find some 20-something who -- who scaled a Guatemalan volcano. For every one of those, you have 10,000 who work their butts off, but you don't do articles about them. We also pile on millennials, because we believe they do have it easier, but how do -- why is it -- why are their lives easier? Because we invented the technology that makes their life easier. Every generation, subsequent generation has it easier -- PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: Because we paved the way. We invent the things. We build the wealth. We create the wealth. Millennials traveling more than ever. Why? Because I invented the plane. WILLIAMS: Thank you, Al Gore. PERINO: Emily, you are not a millennial. COMPAGNO: I'm not a millennial. I want to make that clear. PERINO: But you're on the cusp. You're a young Generation X. GUTFELD: Want you just ask her how old she is, Dana. PERINO: I'm beating around the bush. OK. What do you think of this thing? COMPAGNO: I think what frightens me is it seems like there's no investment. Like, when everyone comes back from living in Bali and doing whatever, what happens when that generation starts aging out? You know, you talked about jobs there are going to be for them. And we're also seeing total vacancies in -- in industries that do depend on that kind of young, now millennial entry-level jobs. Right? So one of them is the restaurant industry. I just said it. So they're experiencing, literally, like vacuums in, for example, hostessing positions or hosting positions -- GUTFELD: If only we had immigrants. WILLIAMS: Imagine that. That would be me. PERINO: There is a legal shortage. WATTERS: Legal immigrants. COMPAGNO: I just -- it worries me, because I don't know what's going to happen when they need what -- GUTFELD: Robots. PERINO: We can have robot -- robot hostesses. Jesse, how do you feel about these youngsters? WATTERS: I look upon them with disdain. PERINO: OK. WATTERS: Because I'm 40 now, and I like -- it makes me feel better. So it's easy to drop out of the workforce and go eat fish tacos by the beach all day and take Instagram pictures. That's easy to do. But they're wasting their lives and their talent, because in your 20s and 30s, you need to develop skills so you can actually make money. GUTFELD: But maybe those are skills. You have to be able to live a comfortable life. When he returned to the workforce and you go to an interview and they go, I see a 15-year gap. What were you doing then? You can't say, \"I was scaling a whatever in Guatemala. You're going to get -- you're going to work for another millennial. PERINO: But also, I do think maybe we're being a little unimaginative, Juan, because of this great technology. So you can kind of work from anywhere. So maybe they've figured out a way to work from Bali. And I just haven't. WATTERS: I don't think that's what's going on. I think they treasure going to Bali. And here's the thing. I think there's a psychological thing at play, which is for all of us, at least, at this table, I believe it's the case that we felt we're going to hustle, we're going to pick up skills. We're calling people like Dana Perino for, you know, career advice. We're those kind of hustlers, Type A's, right? PERINO: Yes. WILLIAMS: But I think for a lot of people today, look at the numbers. You know, college costs are up. Income is stagnant. Home ownership is down. Even to get married, the rates of marriage are down. They're like, \"I don't know if I can make it. I don't know if I'll ever make as much money as my folks, have a house as nice as my folks. You know what, I'm not playing the rat race game. I'm going to Bali.\" PERINO: Right. WILLIAMS: And for a lot of them, that's what they want to do. Now don't - - WATTERS: We're doomed, because China's going to kick out butt, then, Juan, because you need a competitive young generation to go out there and hustle. WILLIAMS: I'm for it. WATTERS: And pass that down to the next generation. WILLIAMS: I agree with you, but I think that what we are not discussing at the table is income inequality. That it's so difficult now to get your foot on the ladder of upward mobility. WATTERS: I see rich people, I aspire to that. I don't drop out and go to Bali. GUTFELD: And you know what? It is inequality, but its status inequality. What they're plagued with now is going on Instagram. And the reason why they're traveling is because they see their friends' Instagram, and they go, \"I have to do that, too.\" It's actually -- you know, you talk about the race up the ladder for money. It's not that. It's status. WATTERS: They're going to Bali, and they're in debt. WILLIAMS: Hold on. You're talking about rich kids who can even think about going to Bali. GUTFELD: Or go to Coachella or go to Bonnaroo, wherever, and have your picture shirtless, wearing beads. I'm tired of those pictures. PERINO: All right. Men, listen up. Another reason for you to eat meat. It could help your love life. We will explain, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COMPAGNO: Hay, single guys. Listen up. So apparently, the quickest way to a woman's heart is through your stomach. That all depends on what you put in it. A new study from Italy finds that when ladies were showed fake bios of potential mates, they were more attractive to those who ate meat than to vegetarians or vegans. Now, this makes sense to me, right. I'm Sicilian-American, and that study came from Italy. We have entire festivals dedicated to meat. So Greg, I see you are wolfing that down. I've heard that your diet is -- GUTFELD: Nothing but -- COMPAGNO: -- mostly meat. Right? GUTFELD: It's almost entirely pork and cow. My favorite are barbecued ribs. I eat them -- COMPAGNO: Pork and cow. GUTFELD: I call it cow, because I like people to know that I'm actually eating a living being. But here's the deal: 100 years from now, how are they going to look at people like me? Because essentially, I'm an earthling eating an earthling. I cow is an earthling? So this could be seen as a form of cannibalism by space aliens. Space aliens could look at earth and go, \"My God, these people eat each other. These species, creatures, eat each other.\" So the solution is to eat the space aliens, because they're really different. COMPAGNO: But you don't know if it's high in protein, though. GUTFELD: Yes, that's true. I would not have a high-carb alien. WILLIAMS: You can't eat robots? GUTFELD: No, you can't. But they can eat you. COMPAGNO: So Dana, what about you? Would you be less attracted to your husband -- is he a vegetarian, first of all? PERINO: No, my husband is not vegetarian. Not in any way. But my family still has cattle ranches in Newcastle, Wyoming. So I highly encourage everyone to eat meat. But I also got to go on safari once in Africa. And the -- we had a guide who explained to us, if you have eyes in front of your head, you are meant to chase. You are meant to chase so that you can get meat. That's what you're supposed supposed to eat. And that animals with eyes on the sides, they're supposed to, you know, gather. GUTFELD: That's a crazy -- PERINO: It made total sense to me. GUTFELD: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) COMPAGNO: Jesse -- oh, have you taken a bite yet? WATTERS: No, I was waiting. PERINO: Self-restraint. WILLIAMS: Can we tell the audience that they told us we should order meat for this segment. So everybody, like -- you know, Greg ordered some ribs. I ordered some chicken. WATTERS: A little rare. WILLIAMS: Tell them what you ordered, Jesse. WATTERS: I got a strip steak with bearnaise sauce. WILLIAMS: That's serious eating. WATTERS: I know. GUTFELD: Nothing changes. WATTERS: I should have asked for a side, too. COMPAGNO: So this makes sense. What do you think about the study? What do you think about this? WATTERS: Listen, I think it goes back to hunters and gatherers. PERINO: Oh, thank you. WATTERS: Women are attracted to men that can go out and stab something with a spear and throw it over a fire and eat it. Plus, it has protein and men -- women like men with muscles. And steak is expensive, and that also attracts women. And if you're a vegan or you eat salad, it makes you a little softer. And, you know, it's not the most masculine thing. It's as simple as that. GUTFELD: Very simple. It is simple. It is literally simple. COMPAGNO: You have a chicken in front of you. You don't have red meat. WILLIAMS: I try not to eat meat. WATTERS: That explains a lot. WILLIAMS: But the funniest thing happened to me on this front in my life. I was living with an African tribe. So I was a kid. I was like a teenager. And the other boys would just make so much fun of me. They would say, \"You smell like meat,\" because they don't eat meat, and I ate meat. They're like, \"You smell like\" -- you know, \"You're a stinker.\" But -- WATTERS: What do they eat? WILLIAMS: What? WATTERS: What do they eat? WILLIAMS: They eat all kinds of things but not meat. They eat fish. They eat -- in fact, they didn't eat that much fish, but they eat vegetarian stuff. And they are very healthy. PERINO: Yes, they were manly men. WILLIAMS: Yes. But I don't eat a lot of beef, because doctors have said to me, especially after prostate cancer, \"Hey, you know, you might slow down a little bit on it.\" WATTERS: Well, meat for me, Juan. COMPAGNO: So \"One More Thing\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: \"One More Thing.\" All right. I'm going to be on Tucker tonight. We'll be talking about my book, I hope. I better be talking about my book, Tucker, because I'm sticking around. But more important, from 7-8 p.m. tonight, which is, what, 4 p.m. West Coast time, I'm going to be on Facebook doing a live autograph signing. So you can come on there, and you can actually get a book signed. And I'll sign -- you get on there, I sign it to you, whatever you want. PERINO: And you get to make fun of them. GUTFELD: I get to -- I get to make fun of you. Tom Shillue is hosting it, and I'll be there. It will be for one hour, 7-8, 4-5. Like right? I can't do -- I can't do math. Yes. All right, we have this, too. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Greg's Sports Corner! (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: All right. This is pretty exciting. You've got to take a look. This is one of the prospects for the NFL. Let's take a look at this cat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CAT KNOCKS DOWN ANOTHER CAT) (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: He's -- depending on his 40 time he could be an early second- round draft pick. Yes. PERINO: Looking forward to football season. GUTFELD: Yes. You better stand for the anthem. All right. Jesse. WATTERS: All right. Dana's \"One More Thing\" video, regarding dogs, I've been a little soft recently. So I'm going to kick it up a notch here. This is a real \"One More Thing\" dog video. Watch this dog steel steal a Go Pro and chase -- GUTFELD: That was great. WATTERS: -- everybody around the backyard. Harrowing video. That's what dogs do, and that's why people like dogs. Dana, that's how you do a \"One More Thing.\" GUTFELD: But you don't like dogs. WATTERS: That is gripping. I've learned to tolerate them. GUTFELD: That's good. Like liberals. PERINO: Stuck with one. WATTERS: That was -- PERINO: That would be Jasper. WATTERS: Yes. PERINO: Jasper. Is it my turn? WATTERS: It wasn't sexual. PERINO: Jasper loves everyone, even Jesse. WATTERS: Even Jesse. PERINO: OK. Get this. Twenty-six-year-old David Casarez (ph), he originally moved to Silicon Valley with the hope of finding a job in the tech industry, but Greg, as you've told us, it's extremely expensive. It was so expensive it forced him into homelessness. However, it didn't stop him from looking for work. On Friday a photo of David handing out resumes and holding a sign which says, \"Hungry for success\" were shared on Twitter and went all around. It was shared by over 130,000 people. And since then he has received hundreds of job offers, including some from industry leaders like Google and Netflix. One CEO has even provided David with temporary housing so he can focus on interviews. So he didn't go to Bali. GUTFELD: No. PERINO: He went to the valley. GUTFELD: Nicely done! Nicely done! All right. Juan. WILLIAMS: Well, Saturday it was girls gone wild in D.C. Yes. My twin granddaughters and their fellow first-graders had a throw-down party. Pepper and Wesley turned six on August 1. The girls said they wanted a luau themed birthday party. So my legal eagle daughter created cake magic, baking two fantastic cakes. And I've got to tell you, they tasted even better than they look. Here, you can see one cake with hula girl on top in a straw skirt atop some sand. Really, it's just crushed peanuts. The other cake, even more amazing, folks. Look at this. It's a pig ready to roast at a luau. WATTERS: That is cultural appropriation, Juan. WILLIAMS: Happy birthday, girls, from your old pop pop. WATTERS: What does that taste like? WILLIAMS: Great kids. PERINO: Strawberry cake? Or what kind of cake? WILLIAMS: It was confetti cake inside. GUTFELD: What is -- what's confetti cake? PERINO: It's like vanilla cake with all sorts of little, like, dots inside it. GUTFELD: I don't like that. WILLIAMS: You don't like vanilla? You don't like -- GUTFELD: No, no, no. I like chocolate cake and just white -- I like Duncan Hines. WILLIAMS: That's good. GUTFELD: Duncan Hines. I'm a -- all right. I hear you. Emily. Your turn. COMPAGNO: I have to say I'm still reeling from your \"don't like dogs\" comment. Like, to me that's worse than being a vegetarian. WATTERS: I'm reeling from some of your comments. WILLIAMS: Whoa! Holy smokes, take it easy. She's a guest, man. WATTERS: I know. All right, Juan. I'm out of line. COMPAGNO: On July 10 last year, we lost seven U.S. Marine raiders and nine Marine aircraft crew members of a KC-130 in a tragic crash in Mississippi while they were on transit -- in transit to pre-deployment training. So on the first anniversary of the crash this month, a team of 30 Marine raiders and special amphibious reconnaissance Navy corpsmen undertook an 11-day, 900-mile ruck march from the crash site in Mississippi back to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. This was called the Marine Raider Memorial March, and it honored the Marines who died, symbolizing bringing them back home on the voyage they were unable to make. And the march was just completed this Friday that we just had. PERINO: That's impressive and very important. WATTERS: Hear that, millennials? Real Americans right there. PERINO: Emily's \"One More Thing\" was the best one. GUTFELD: All right. WATTERS: Excuse me. GUTFELD: Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" He's a triple threat.

            "article_content": "Columnist, author and Fox News commentator Charles Krauthammer lived his life telling others exactly what he thought. Long-time Fox News panelist Charles Krauthammer, a psychiatrist, Pulitzer Prize-winner and bestselling author, who died Thursday at age 68, regularly commented on issues great and small. Following is a selection of his wisdom from exclusive, in-depth interviews he has done with Fox News: GETTING IT RIGHT \u201cI decided to become a writer so I could write about politics, because I thought that\u2019s the most important thing one can involve oneself in. In the end, all the beautiful, elegant things in life, the things that I care about, the things that matter, depend on getting the politics right. Because in those societies where they get it wrong, everything else is destroyed, everything else is leveled.\u201d AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM \u201cAmerica is the only country ever founded on an idea.\u00a0The only country that is not founded on race or even common history. It's founded on an idea and the idea is liberty.\u00a0That is probably the rarest phenomena in the political history of the world; this has never happened before. And not only has it happened, but it's worked. We are the most flourishing, the most powerful, most influential country on Earth with this system, invented by the greatest political geniuses probably in human history.\u201d GO WHERE THE EVIDENCE TAKES YOU. \u201cI was a Great Society liberal.\u00a0 I thought we ought to help the poor, we ought to give them all the money we can.\u00a0 And then, the evidence started to pour in.\u00a0The evidence of how these grand programs, the poverty programs, the welfare programs--everything was making things worse. I didn't have a dog in that fight.\u00a0 I was willing to go where the evidence led.\u00a0 As a doctor, I'd been trained in empirical evidence.\u00a0 If the treatment is killing your patients, you stop the treatment.\u201d THE RIGHT WORDS MATTER \u201c[Playwright] Tom Stoppard once said the reason he writes is because every once in a while you put a few words together in the right order and you're able to give the world a nudge.\u00a0And sometimes I'm able to do that.\u201d HOW TO PERSUADE OTHERS \u201cYou don't want to talk in high-falutin\u2019, ridiculous abstractions that nobody understands. Just try to make things plain and clear. The one thing I try to do when I want to persuade someone is never start with my assumptions, because if I do, we're not going to get anywhere. You have to figure out what the other person believes, and then try to draw a line from what they believe into what you believe in by showing them a logical sequence.\u00a0But you\u2019ve got to lead them along and you have to have it clear in your head from the beginning or you'll never get there.\u201d HOW HE MELLOWED \u201cI've calmed down a bit from where I thought: this is it, it\u2019s the end, we're done.\u00a0I\u2019ve sort of accepted the fact that there's an organic evolution to society, and as long as we keep civil society strong and in constraint to some extent, we're going to do okay.\u00a0 So I guess you could say I've become a mellow conservative.\u201d THE IMPORTANCE OF STRUCTURE \u201cWhen you write anything--a column, an essay--if you have the structure right, everything is easy. You get the structure wrong, you'll never get it right. You\u2019ll spend hours whacking your way through the weeds with a machete and you won't be able to escape the marsh.\u201d Napolitano Reflects on Krauthammer INDIVIDUALS MAKE A DIFFERENCE \u201cIn our sophisticated historical analyses, we tend to attribute everything to these large underlying currents, to certain political ideologies, or social changes like industrialization or the growth of women's rights and all that. But that\u2019s missing the obvious\u2014there\u2019s usually a person who influenced things in a way that all the underlying forces cannot account for. In American history, (there\u2019s) \u00a0Washington, Lincoln, FDR, Reagan--they all stand out.\u00a0 It\u2019s a way of looking at history that's less abstract, and is more recognizing the individual, which we tend not to do.\u201d FAITH \u201cFaith is something that one has or doesn't have; one doesn't construct it. The one thing I do believe is that of all the possible views of God, atheism is the least plausible.\u00a0The idea that there's no meaning or purpose or origin--that the Universe is as it always was, is to me entirely implausible for reasons of physics, apart from faith. Because if you reason back to first causes, and if you\u2019re an atheist, you get to a logical contradiction.\u201d BEAUTY DOESN\u2019T NEED A PURPOSE \u201cIn major league baseball you can see the highest level of play\u2014it\u2019s irresistible. I love the game And there's such a beauty in the intricacy of chess--you use words that to a non-player seem nonsensical\u2014elegance, romance\u2014people don\u2019t see it when you push a piece of wood across a board. Anything done at a high level of excellence always intrigues me because it's the ultimate expression of being human, that you do something, something you don't have to do. What's the point of playing chess?\u00a0 There is no point.\u00a0 There doesn't have to be a point.\u00a0 It's just the beauty of the exercise and the difficulty of it that make it worthwhile, admirable and very pleasurable.\u201d HIS LUCK \u201c[Writing commentary] is more than passion.\u00a0 It's purpose.\u00a0 I'm very lucky to have ended up where I am by pure blind luck--how I stumbled upon what I was meant to do.\u00a0 It turns out I have some aptitude for it and I love it and I think it's important.\u00a0 That's a great rarity in life.\u00a0And I appreciate every day I wake up that I can do that and it turned out that way.\u201d HIS PARALYSIS \u201cAll it means is whatever I do is a little bit harder and probably a little bit slower.\u00a0And that's basically it.\u00a0Everybody has their cross to bear-- everybody. I made a promise to myself on day one [after my injury].\u00a0 I was not going to allow it to alter my life. It's very easy to be characterized by the externalities in your life. I dislike people focusing on it. I made a vow when I was injured that it would never be what would characterize my life.\u00a0 I don't want it to be the first line of my obituary. If it is, that will be a failure.\u201d",

This is a rush transcript from \"Justice with Judge Jeanine,\" June 30, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JEANINE PIRRO, HOST: Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being us tonight and thanks so much for making \"Justice\" number one again last weekend. I really appreciate it. and look who is hear? Lara Trump is live in our studio and will join me in a moment. And I'll also be speaking later with Congressman Duncan Hunter, Michelle Malkin, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and more. But first, my opening statement. The rise of socialism has never been more clear. Right now in America, there are forces dug in, organized and well funded, doing whatever is necessary to make socialism happen. Today's demonstrations are part of an ongoing step-by-step agenda to change our country at its very core. They demand the abolition of ICE -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the zero-tolerance policy of the Trump administration. (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) CYNTHIA NIXON, AMERICAN ACTRESS: I think we need to abolish ICE, that seems really clear. They have strayed so far from the interest of the American people and the interest of humanity. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) PIRRO: Cynthia, are you stupid? I know as an actress you are used to saying what is on the script and this government thing is new to you, but strayed so far from the interests of the American people? The whole point of ICE is to protect the American people from illegals who would do us harm physically and financially. And listen to this one. (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ICE isn't doing what it was created to do, it's being used as his own personal police force and in those actions it's actually making us less safe. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) PIRRO: ICE isn't doing what it was created to do? ICE is doing exactly what it was created to do. Are you stupid, too? And the President is using it as his own police force? When ICE was doing its job in 2009 to 2016, was it Obama's police force? And you think ICE is making us less safe? I've got two word for you. Kate Steinle -- a primer. For all you geniuses out there. ICE does not separate children and parents at the border. Border Patrol does that. and if you abolish ICE, who will arrest the drug dealers and the coyotes coming across our border in droves delivering 80% of the narcotics and 90% of the heroin here? and pray tell, who deports the illegal who committed rape when he finishes his jail time? Should we just let bygones be bygones and throw down the welcome mat to the local YMCA, give him his food stamps and call it a day? You don't want them deported. Maybe they ought to come live with you. And Kirsten Gillibrand, a United States Senator who has ambition to run for President in 2020 says... (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y.: We should protect families that need our help and that is not what ICE is doing today and that's why I believe, you should get rid of it, start over, re-imagine it and build something that actually works. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) PIRRO: Why is it that whenever a Democrat doesn't want to follow the law, they say it's broken. The immigration system is broken, ICE is broken. How about I say, the tax system is broken, and we don't then have to pay our taxes and we can go suck another capitalist country dry. That way none of us have to pay taxes. The truth, Americans want the immigration laws enforced, even 60% of the Democrats want that. Those laws protect jobs and the more people who come in especially the poor ones, the more taxes we pay for their education, medication, housing and social services. And when we don't know who is coming in, we cannot screen for gangs and drug dealing operatives. Not to mention, none of this is fair to those immigrants who played by the rules. The narrative of today's protest is backwards. Those marching object to adults who cross the border being separated from their children. It happened even before Trump was President. No one cared, objected or protested. Trump issues an executive order to end the family separations, and yet they still march. So what's going on? The overarching message is that illegals, people who do not respect our laws are entitled to everything that we Americans are. That they are being wronged by Americans if we don't share our wealth, our capitalist success and our way of life with them. This, my friends, is socialism. Like the women's march, these anti-Trump protesters are extremely well organized, and they are more than political. They are ideological. We are witnessing the evolution of a socialist coup. And if you don't believe what I am saying, take it from their own mouths. (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) CROWD: (Chanting) \"F your borders, F your walls, we will make your system fall.\" (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) PIRRO: Did you hear it? F your borders, F your walls, we will make your system fall. This week's primary win by a 28-year-old socialist Congressional candidate who took down a well funded long-term New York congressman is about more than one district, and although Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deserves credit for working hard, she won the assistance of the Democratic socialists of America, and don't forget, a little known socialist from Vermont would have been the Democratic candidate for President in 2016, but for the Hillary Clinton corruption of the Democratic National Committee, and make no mistake, folks, socialists are beginning to win elections at the state and national level, defeating even long-term incumbents. And expect more hard left Democratic candidates to run. Even Obama's cradle to grave fictional ad called \"The Life of Julia\" suggests an anti- capitalist socialist framework. And for those of you who need reminding, socialism doesn't work. The crushing poverty and violence in Venezuela is just the latest example. According to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" people go through garbage bags full of rubbish to take whatever they can and then try to sell the empty bags. Socialism when private property in the distribution of income is subject to state control hasn't worked out very well in Sweden either. National healthcare, far from what they promised, pregnant mothers are turned away from maternity wards because of overcrowding causing women to give birth on the streets. Socialists have or want what you have. I for one work hard, pay taxes, believe in capitalism and have no plans to move to Venezuela or Sweden. One of my heroes, Margaret Thatcher put it best when she said, \"The trouble with socialism is that eventually, you run out of other people's money.\" And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram #judgejeanine. And joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and much more is President Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. All right, good evening, Laura, welcome to \"Justice.\" Thanks for being in the studio tonight. LARA TRUMP, DAUGHTER IN LAW OF DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Absolutely. PIRRO: All right, so what do you think of these well organized demonstrations that in spite of the fact that the President issued an executive order saying, \"You know, we're going to stop the separation of children from parents.\" They're still marching. TRUMP: Yes, well, I mean, you said it best. Listen, this has been happening for a long time. What we see is that Donald Trump is the law and order President. He wants to enforce the laws that by the way have been there for many, many years, and to see what is happening out there is really scary, and I hope people are paying close attention because what people should understand is that if they are voting for someone who wants to abolish ICE, these people are putting illegal immigrants, drug dealers, gangs, ahead of American citizens. They are saying that they are more important than you, than me, than everyone in this country. It's very, very scary stuff. PIRRO: But you know, Lara, I mean, does it worry you when we see that this young woman, and to her credit, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she won. She is clearly -- she calls herself a socialist. She believes in the socialist agenda. I mean, we just had Bernie Sanders almost have a Democratic nomination. I mean, there is this organized effort. Do you ever think about it? TRUMP: Well, I think about it all the time. It's very scary. In fact, one of the things that I want to make very clear to people is that if this scares you, you have to get out in the midterms and you have to make sure that you are voting for the right candidates. Republicans who are going to support the President, otherwise this is what we are going to see happen. And make no mistake about it, the Democrats are grasping for anything they can. They are desperate right now and if they think this is the way out, I hope that the American people have a resounding effect in November whenever they say we do not want this to become our country. PIRRO: You know, I was just reading an article that said that millennials today have like 34% less income than the last generation did. They don't have the homeownership, nowhere near it. And yet if millennials latch on to this concept of we want money, we want free this, free education, free everything, that they could be a powerful voting bloc. TRUMP: They could. It's so funny because it sounds so good in theory, why wouldn't we just take other people's money. But you just said it. What happens when you run out of that money? And I think what happens generally is, people have these ideas that socialism could possibly work. First of all, when has it ever worked? It's never worked anywhere. And then they get out and they start getting jobs and they start paying taxes and they realize why it doesn't work. And so, hopefully all of these millennials will benefit from the very low unemployment numbers that we now have under this President, go out, get a job and realize that this doesn't work. PIRRO: Okay, I want to switch gears a little bit, okay, you are a new mother, how old is baby Luke. TRUMP: Luke is nine months old, and as big as he can be. PIRRO: I know, I follow you on Instagram. He's adorable. You know, this week we have seen a lot of pushback against women, Republican conservative women by the left. Maxine Waters flipping her lid literally saying go after them. Sarah Sanders being forced out of a restaurant and on and on, Pam Bondi who is going to be on in a little bit. I mean, do you worry about that, Lara? TRUMP: You know, I hope that people would have a little more sense than to listen to somebody who sounds as crazy as Maxine Waters. I tend to think that if we can be civil to one another, that's all you can ask for. Let's all be friendly, but yes, I mean, it should worry everyone out there, that you have someone who is an elected official calling for harassment of people that supporting our President, who, don't forget, half the country voted into office. It's really scary stuff, and you know, women, men -- everybody should be very concerned with this. And again, that's all the more reason the midterms are so, so important. You've got to get rid of these kind of people. PIRRO: Well, when they were protesting the Department Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen outside of her home. I mean, there is nothing more private and frightening than somebody coming to your home. I mean, there's no gate around it. I mean -- and they go right up to them and who was the one who said, go right up to them and make sure that they hear you and Pam Bondi talks about them in her face, literally, she said, screaming at her, men, an inch from her face. It's scary stuff. I've never seen anything like this. TRUMP: Yes, well, but what we are seeing, Judge, is that I really do think people are getting desperate when it comes to the Democratic Party because they realize that this President is winning for the United States of America again, and it makes them very, very nervous. Because remember, first of all, they never thought Donald Trump was going to get elected. Now that he's in and he's doing such a great job for this country, what are they running on? What are their talking points? So, instead, they are saying go out and harass people who support the President. It's crazy. PIRRO: You know what's amazing to me, when I first heard the statistics, and you know, your father-in-law, I mean, I've been friends with more many, many years. But when I heard there were more jobs than people to fill them. I had to repeat that in my head and say, I can't -- I mean, it's fantastic. It really is. He's a businessman. He came at just the right time. But finally, let me ask you this. You expect -- I mean, I expect, we all expect that the Supreme Court nomination that he's going to announce his nominee a week from Monday is going to be a bitter fight. But 2018 midterms historically, the President in his first term, his party loses the House. Do you think that that's not going to happen now that all of the records that he's broken, he will continue to break them? TRUMP: Well, of course, Donald Trump doesn't play by the normal rules, and the normal rules don't apply to him, so if ever, Judge, there's an opportunity here for the Republicans to not only keep the majority in the House, but gain a few more seats in the Senate, it is 2018 and I really do think that people are very scared about socialism. They are very scared about the chaos that we see happening out there and they are ready to put more Trump supporting Republicans in the House and Senate. We will see. PIRRO: You know, you use a perfect word, \"chaos,\" that's what's going on. Lara Trump, so great to have you in studio tonight. TRUMP: Thank you. PIRRO: Thanks. And Michelle Malkin, Pam Bondi and Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk all on deck tonight, but next, we'll get deeper into the immigration issue and the calls to abolish ICE. I'm joined live by Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter. \"Justice\" rolls on in a moment. Welcome back to \"Justice\" live from New York on this busy night of news. A lot to talk about with my next guest from the Democrats call to abolish ICE to the serious port security concerns right here in the United States. Congressman Duncan Hunter joins me now. All right, good evening, Congressman. Very quickly, I mean, the President signed an executive order. He stopped the separation of children from their parents at the border, and yet, they still march. Does this signal to you that this is about more than just the separation of children from their parents? DUNCAN HUNTER, US CONGRESSMAN, CALIFORNIA, REPUBLICAN: Totally. This is all about politics. This is not even about the Democrats winning on DACA and getting those votes. This is simply about keeping true. This is what -- I think it's about keeping a slave class of people in this country who will vote Democrat that will never be American citizens. The Democrats don't want to fix this problem, so President Trump had to. Now, if we have e-verify and build the border wall, we'll be in great shape. PIRRO: Okay, all right I want to move to a topic that I find very interesting, and that is a company called Gulftainer and I know that you're familiar with it, I know that you've been watching it and tell me about Gulftainer, what it is? Who owns it and what does it have to do with American port security? HUNTER: So, Gulftainer is the largest Middle Eastern port management and container company. They are from the Emirates. The owner's brother was Saddam Hussein's former nuclear science adviser that helped build some nice nuclear stuff with the North Koreans and the Russians. So that kind of gives you a general take on its corporate hierarchy. It's owned by a company called Crescent, also with military Islamic ties in the Middle East and Turkish ties and Russian ties. So, in our wisdom in this country, they ask for a massive port facility in Wilmington and the United States says, \"Hey, that sounds great.\" So, while we are doing all these other things on immigration, stopping people and families of people bringing in marijuana and cocaine across the border, we are opening up a giant port facility where the Russians and our enemies could literally put in massive cargo containers full of -- I mean, name the type of bomb you want to name that they could ever -- anything from chemical, biological, electromagnetic pulse, nuclear weapons. The point is that while we are doing all of this stuff with immigration, at the same time, we just handed over one of the nation's premiere container ports to the United Arab Emirates. PIRRO: All right, and so you are talking about the one in Delaware. This Gulftainer deal that they say is -- it involves a Club K System. What is a Club K System? HUNTER: So, here is what Club K is. It doesn't involve it, but the company Gulftainer is owned by another big conglomerate called Crescent that has ties with a Russia company. Now, we're getting complex, but Trump has already slapped sanctions on the Russian company that makes a cargo container missile system. So it's a cargo container that goes on trains or ships or trucks. It holds four cruise missiles and those can have any kinds of warheads that they want. But the point is, Wilmington is about 125 miles away from DC, about 110 miles -- 125 miles from New York City and now we are going to give a foreign country an opening to bring in kind of whatever they want there. So, I'm not saying they are going to use Club K. They are not going to have missile system container boxes coming in, but the option is now there and there is nothing the US can do about it if they want to get by all of our concerns. Because we can set up as many security measures at a port like this as we want to, but if the major owner of that port wants to bypass or get around our security measures, they can do so because they own the port. PIRRO: Okay, so they own the port. They have these Gulftainers that are capable of holding a cruise missile? HUNTER: Yes. And this doesn't just go from there, but they also control what gets shipped from foreign countries. So if you look at what President Trump did when it came to the Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm, the mix of our 5G/LTE chips, President Trump stopped that. He said no. If that's dangerous, if given the Chinese the ability to have the same technology and know the technology companies that own it, that we use in our phones, this by God has got to be massively dangerous. Because you are literally putting lives on the line allowing them bring in nuclear threats right on US soil. PIRRO: Well, the amazing part of this is that, you would think that CFIUS would have to approve this and I understand that they didn't. They said there is an exception for this. HUNTER: Yes, from what I understand, they did not look at this as a national security case which allowed CFIUS to kind of go around President Trump and around General Mattis, excuse me, Secretary of Defense Mattis. It if was a national security fix, the President and Mattis would have had to have looked at it. From what I understand, they were able to get around that, so that's a loophole that they exploited and that we're going to try to exploit back and still stop them from doing that. PIRRO: Congressman Duncan Hunter. We're going to stay on top of this Gulftainer issuer. Thank you so much. HUNTER: Thank you, Judge. PIRRO: All right, and Charlie Kirk still ahead, plus, I go one-on-one with Chris Hahn. But next, tamping down the rhetoric, the call for civility and the lowering of the volume on both sides of the aisle. Michelle Malkin and Pam Bondi join me in a moment to talk about it. MARIANNE RAFFERTY, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Marianne Rafferty. A ceasefire in South Sudan violated just hours after it began. The warring parties there agreed to a ceasefire last Wednesday, set to again at 12:00 a.m. Saturday, but each side accusing the other of attacking in the early hours of Saturday morning. The bloody South Sudanese Civil War has raged for five years killing tens of thousands of people. And Ted Cruz going against his own party in an upcoming election. The Texas Senator upset that holocaust denier, Arthur Jones has won the Republican nomination for Illinois third Congressional district. Cruz tweeting, \"This is horrific. An avowed Nazi running for Congress. To the good people of Illinois, you had two reasonable choices, write in another candidate or vote for the Democrat. This bigoted fool should receive zero votes.\" I'm Marianne Rafferty. Now back to \"Justice with Judge Jeanine.\" (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) MAXINE WATERS, US REPRESENTATIVE, CALIFORNIA, DEMOCRAT: If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station. You get up and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they are not welcome anymore anywhere. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) PIRRO: That's good old Maxine Waters, Congresswoman, a few days ago, ramping up the rhetoric against the Trump administration. Tonight, I have two strong conservative women to respond to this and talk about a call for civility. Joining me now, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and CRTV commentator, Michelle Malkin. Okay, all right, so there you have it, you push back, you go after them. You do whatever you have to do and impeach Trump. So, Pam, I believe it was Sunday night, you had gone to the movies, and you had a rather horrible experience that I'd like maybe -- I'd like you to talk about for a moment or two. PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL, FLORIDA: Sure. Friday night, my boyfriend and I were walking in the movies, \"The Documentary of Mr. Rogers,\" of all things, about what? Civility, humility, anti-bullying. Two or three big guys came up to me, they're filming it, said I was ripping babies out of mother's arms. And I disputed them on that. They didn't know what they were talking about. I was very kind to them. Of course, they didn't air that video. They started screaming in my face. Lost control. We bought our tickets, went into the vestibule, and continued to get there... PIRRO: And by the way, you're seeing this on the screen, folks. Sorry, Pam. Go ahead. BONDI: Jeanine, that's after the fact. So, that's the fourth incident. So walking in this happens. They go nuts. They are screaming, yelling, blocking me from walking in. That's when my security, they came up, stopped them. I thought they were gone. We went to the snack bar, then they came up again, yelling at the top of my head, every curse, baiting my boyfriend, saying, \"Come on, come on, aren't you going to protect her? Aren't you going to do something?\" Trying to get him to fight them. They spit on my head. Now, whether it was unintentional, I can't prove because he was yelling so loud, my hair was blowing. The guy inches from my face. It was that -- and then the incident that you saw was two hours later. They were not going to run me out of a theater. PIRRO: So, you stayed for the movie. BONDI: A few hours after the movie, we stayed for the movie, and then they called in more protesters. So what you heard was tame. That's the part they chose to post on Facebook. I was not going out a back door. I was going out of the front door that I walked in. PIRRO: And I am aware of that and I was proud of you for that, but Michelle, you had an experience that was not so friendly. MICHELLE MALKIN, COMMENTATOR, CRTV: No, I've have had many and many in the heart of DC where all of the self-appointed arbiters of civility rule. And in part, it's why I decided to move my family away from there 10 years ago. Because I would be on the political and rhetorical battlefield every night on TV. Then the next day, on a Saturday at iHop, I'd have people in my face practically spitting the way that they did with Pam while my kids were trying to enjoy their happy face pancakes. This is toxic. This is not healthy. And we do have to underscore that the war on conservative women, right of center women, independent thinking, limited government women has been waged and festering for a long, long time. And the escalation with President Trump in office and so many more women able and willing to be outspoken tells you that this is what they fear. You know what the ultimate C word is, gals? Conservative -- it is an offense to the radical left because they believe they can lay claim to our chromosomes and our minds. PIRRO: I want to get to where we are going from here. I mean, the threats toward women, and I have my own stories, I mean, I am not going to waste this time, I mean, I am as outspoken as the next, but the threats are growing in ferocity. Opposing points of view are not being tolerated. There is this call to arms, a mob mentality. We are the fascists when they are trying to shut us up. That's what I call a fascist. So what do we do now? Pam, you do file charges. Let me ask you this, you are a former Assistant DA and former prosecutor DA, did you file charges against them for harassment? BONDI: There is a police report being written. That's what they wanted. They wanted to be taken out in handcuffs or they wanted to cause a brawl and have someone else be taken out. And I wasn't going to let that happen. We tried to get video from the theater. They didn't have it. They soon will, I think. They didn't have it, they'll soon put it in, but, no, I didn't. We filed an incident report because I made a restraining order against them because they have been tweeting. But you know what they're doing is, our President is doing such a great job. President Trump is incredible with what he's doing. (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: But this is about you, Pam. It's about you. They are coming for you. If you and your boyfriend -- I think -- is your boyfriend is tall? BONDI: Tall. PIRRO: That's what I thought. You have a really tall boyfriend and they are attacking you in front of your boyfriend. What happens? And I know you are the Attorney General. I mean, you have a security detail. I used to, but when you are alone. What if you are getting your nails done? I mean, what you and Michelle- what do you do? MALKIN: Well, you arm yourself both literally and figuratively. I have a concealed weapons permit. I have had one for 10 to 15 years back to my days as an editorial writer and columnist at the \"Seattle Times,\" before that at the \"Los Angeles Daily News,\" where I faced my first death threat from the Mexican mafia. Conservative women never run from a fight. We are the ones that run towards the fire. And showing fear is the first thing that is necessary, and of course, we are all women in either public office or in the public square, but what conservative women and Trump women know is, anybody is vulnerable to this now. We know that we can risk the principles in our lives for that and we are willing to do it. That's why the left goes after us. BONDI: They cannot quiet the President and so they think they can quite us and they are not. We are going to continue our support for this great President. PIRRO: You know what, I respect you. I know you. I know each one of you. I know how you think, but at some point, do we have to tamp it down? MALKIN: Well, we are not the ones who have to tamp it down. The climate of hatred from the left and the progressives, their demonization and dehumanization particularly of women. I talked about this, the four stages of female conservative abuse that everyone has faced from Phyllis Schlafly to Michelle Botana (ph) to Sarah Palin, to this generation now of young millennials who are facing this on college campuses. We are not the ones -- the onus and the burden is not on us. If they started treating conservative women as women who believe in their principles and care about children and families, then we get a (inaudible)... (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: So, Pam Bondi, we've got 15 seconds, what do you do? BONDI: Sure, well, we continue what we are doing without fear. They are breeding hate and we are not going to let it continue. They tweeted vicious things after they did this to me. And they went after a state senator, a female, and a state representative when she was in a coffee shop with her children. So, we cannot back down. We are not going to run and hide. They are calling us monsters, they are saying, \"Don't let them breed. Go after them.\" Some of the tweets were so threatening, they had to -- Twitter removed them. That's what they are trying to do, and they are not going to win. PIRRO: All right, out of time. Michelle Malkin, Pam Bondi. We have to have a longer discussion on this. Thanks so much for being with us. Thank you. BONDI: Thank you. PIRRO: And last week, we tussled over immigration. You liked it so much I invited Chris Hahn back to \"Justice\" for round two. I think you're going like it again. Coming up next. The battle over civility continues to intensify tonight, and joining me now with his take on it all, former adviser to Chuck Schumer, radio show talk show host, Chris Hahn. All right, Chris, you heard Maxine Waters. \"Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to and if you see anybody in a restaurant, department store, gas station. get out, create a crowd, push back, tell them they are not welcome anywhere anymore.\" What's that about, Chris? CHRIS HAHN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: First of all, I don't agree with any of that. and I know Senator Schumer made a statement from the floor distancing himself from that, too, disavowing that completely. I believe that we have to have civil discourse. I believe that we could disagree without being disagreeable and I think there's a time and a place to protest and when people are out to dinner or going to a movie, as your last guest was, I don't think that's the time and place to protest. Go to their office. Go to their meetings. Write letters, make phone calls, but we've got to be nice about it. And I think the President could do a little bit more to lead the civility here, too with some of his tweets being a little over the top. But that doesn't excuse anybody who goes out there and get in people's face physically. PIRRO: Okay, let's -- this isn't the President who is being harassed. This is Pam Bondi, Sarah Sanders in a restaurant with her family, Kirstjen Nielsen in a restaurant having dinner. I'm sure she worked an 18-hour day. They go to her home. They are pushing back on everyone. I walk down the street in Manhattan. I honestly, am not worried about a thing, but I get it, too. I mean, why is it that the conservative women are getting it? What are we doing to deserve it? I'm walking down the street. Pam Bondi is going to the movies. Sarah Sanders is having dinner. Kirsten is having dinner in her house. What is this craziness? It's lunacy. HAHN: Well, look, I think it is bad, but this is not limited to conservatives. PIRRO: Well, give me an example of a Democrat -- wait a minute, Chris, time. Give me a Democrat woman who was harassed by conservatives and conservatives who called other people to say don't let them stay anywhere, get in their face. Give me one example. You can't. You can't because it's not happening. HAHN: I can give you an example, but there was -- look, there are definitely examples of progressives and Democrats being protested right at their homes. PIRRO: Who? HAHN: Chuck Schumer had a protest outside of his home a couple of years back. PIRRO: Chuck Schumer is a guy. I'm talking about women with their families. Michelle Malkin at iHop having pancakes. Cut it out. You can't make one incident where conservatives have gone after a woman. HAHN: First of all, all the women you mentioned are strong women. I might agree with them, you are a strong women -- and by the way, and you included are strong as any man. So, I don't think we should distinguish between men and women. PIRRO: Do you think I could deck a guy as quickly as he could deck me? Come on. HAHN: It depends. I wouldn't want one of your heels to my head. It would hurt. You know, look, you are tough. We know that, Judge, I've been around you long enough to know how tough you are, but that said, nobody should be getting in anybody's physical space. That's not what this is about. We are Americans, we could disagree with each other, without coming to blows, without invading people's personal space. I think that's despicable. I think that kind of stuff needs to stop. And as for Sarah Sanders, let me make one more point, as for Sarah Sanders, that restaurant should have served her. And the guy who makes the cake in Colorado should have baked the cake for the gay couple that was getting married. PIRRO: No, no. Let me explain the difference, Chris, and I'm so glad you brought that up. Here in lies the rub, and I don't mean to point my finger. But where religion is involved, freedom of religion, religious freedom takes priority. All right, that baker had no problem serving gay. He didn't want to make the wedding cake because that was contrary to his religious beliefs, the wedding. He'd sell them nine million chocolate cakes. HAHN: Take the slippery slope. PIRRO: It was the wedding cake, but you know what? That's not the point. Chris, should Pam Bondi, should she have filed criminal charges? You and I both know that's harassment? HAHN: You know what? I mean, it's a political question for her, right? How is that going to look politically in her state? I don't know the answer to that. I think, if it was me, I would file criminal charges if I were her. But you know, if these people are harassing, I didn't see the tape. I didn't see the video. I don't know exactly what happened, but if they were trying to incite violence, that crosses the line in my opinion for peaceful protest. PIRRO: Well, you're right, Chris, and I have to tell you, I am not going to fight with you anymore because we seem to be agreeing with each other, but one thing we don't agree on though is that is this is all from the left to the right, but everything has to be tamped down because this is getting out of control. And at the end of the day, someone -- a lot of people are going to get hurt and people need to just respect each other. You know, I could fight with you verbally. I would never get in your face, in your space, go to your house, throw you out of a restaurant, that's not the way to behave. Chris, thanks for being with us tonight. HAHN: No. Thanks for having me, Judge. PIRRO: All right, and when Bill Maher and Mike Moore get together, you know it's going to be something. They made my list of outrageous statements this week, and Charlie Kirk joins me next to talk about it. Don't go away. What do you get when you combine Bill Maher and Michael Moore? Outrageous comments at the very least. That's what and that's... (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) MICHAEL MOORE, AMERICAN FILM MAKER: ... week after week, fascism is at the doorstep. We are in... BILL MAHER, HOST, REAL TIME: A moving coup. MOORE: People are afraid to use the word, but I think that we've got to be very serious about this. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) PIRRO: And that's just one of the most of outrageous things I heard this week. Here to break it all down, founder of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk. All right, is fascism at the doorstep, Charlie? CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: He wouldn't know fascism if it hit him in wherever -- you know what? Look, I'll tell you, of course not. I mean, this is a common talking point of the left. It's really interesting. A primary component of implementing fascist policies would be let's say, gun confiscation. You have a President who is trying to protect the Second Amendment and the rights of the citizens. He's trying to protect free speech rights. In fact, if you look at what fascism really is, it is a sister of socialism. It just means bigger government. It means more control and the President every single front is trying to protect the freedoms and liberties of the American people. This is a fear mongering tactic by the hard left to put try to actually put forth a talking point and accuse other people of what they are actually doing, which is one of Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals. PIRRO: Indeed, and also fascism doesn't tolerate independent thought, and it is the left that is trying to stifle the conservatives. All right, now I think we have got a Chelsea Handler tweet. It says, \"Trump and Putin are going to meet on July 16 in Finland which means Trump has two weeks to get in shape to fit into his wedding dress.\" What is that about? KIRK: She is a comedian, right? I mean that was so funny I forgot to laugh. The left has completely killed comedy in America. I mean, this goes to this pathological hatred of Trump, and I had to summarize it shortly, I would say this, it's not that the left is afraid that Donald Trump will fail, they are terrified that he actually might succeed because he's going to be the most of successful President in our lifetime, if not one of the most of successful Presidents in American history and when that does happens, all these horrible jokes, the Kathy Griffin stunt tactics, the hatred embedded in the Democratic Party will shatter. They will have nothing to stand on because despite all that opposition, despite all the mockery and all false prophecy, you will have a President that will have turned this country from the abyss back to prosperity, and so they are not afraid that he's going to fail, they are afraid he's going to succeed. PIRRO: And you know what's amazing to me, Charlie, is I see this stuff play out, I still can't believe it. I can't believe that the left that is supposed to be so protective of women is yelling and I am sure you may have heard this segment with Pam Bondi and Michelle Malkin. You know, go after them. Do whatever you have to do. Get a crowd. It's pretty outrageous. But let's talk about the next thing I heard. Jon Stewart last night delivered a message to the President. Let's listen to it. (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) JON STEWART, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: I just want to say, there is one hallmark to your presidency that I think we're finding the most of difficult is that no matter what you do, it always comes with an extra layer of gleeful cruelty. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) PIRRO: What is he talking about? KIRK: Yes, I mean, exactly. Let's take -- so gleeful cruelty, so when he gives tax cuts to millions of Americans that's gleeful cruelty. When he abolishes ISES from taking over the Middle East, that's gleeful cruelty or when he takes nuclear weapons away from North Korea, that's gleeful cruelty or when he pardons Alice Johnson from a life sentence. I mean, that's somehow -- look, again, this is back to this pathological hatred of Donald Trump. They don't look at things rationally. They have completely lost their mind, they're almost having a competition. It's almost like they are having the outrage Olympics trying to see who can say the most outrageous thing from week to week and they seem to continue to outdo themselves. PIRRO: And you know, as we go forward in 2018, I have to tell you something, Charlie, it seems to me as people listen to this stuff, they say to themselves, first of all, he's not that bad, my life seems to be a lot better. It seems safer. I mean, I've got a job. I don't have to have three jobs or whatever it might be. That I think that more and more independents are saying this left is really just -- this is my open talk, this is socialism. KIRK: That's exactly right and look, the modern day Democratic Party has moved so far to the left. They are having a competition now who can be the socialist, or the communist or the Marxist, it's scary, and so you articulated it so well. If you look at the last 100 years, socialism has been tried 100 times, and we have 100 million people that have been murdered, civilizations destroyed and countries ruined and this will only further the chance of Donald Trump winning reelection and us succeeding in the midterms, the more radically left the Democrat Party goes, however, it is horrifying to think if they ever get back the reins of power. PIRRO: Indeed, Charlie Kirk. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. KIRK: Thank you, Judge. PIRRO: All right, we'll be right back. Finally tonight, don't forget to friend me on Facebook and follow me on Twitter and on Instagram @judge_jeanine. I'd love to read your comments.

            "article_content": "U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen speaks in front of a newly fortified border wall structure on Friday. (Associated Press) Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said \"everything is on the table\" with regard\u00a0to border security during the unveiling of a border wall project\u00a0in California on Friday. Nielsen's remarks came as the Trump administration considers ways to slow\u00a0immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border and as a caravan of migrants\u00a0-- mostly made up of thousands fleeing violence and poverty in Central America -- are making their way north through Mexico. The caravan covered more than 60 miles Friday and was roughly 990 miles from McAllen, Texas, and over 2,300 miles from San Diego. \"We are looking at every possible way within the legal construct that we have to make sure that those who don't have the legal right to come to this country do not come in,\" Nielsen said from the El Centro Sector near Calexico in front of a newly constructed\u00a030-foot, two-mile fence. \"Looking at this, I would not attempt to climb it,\" she added. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, center, embraces Gloria Chavez, Border Patrol chief of the El Centro sector, as the look at a plaque adorning a newly fortified border wall structure Friday. (Associated Press) In an effort to enhance security, the Pentagon recently approved a request for 800 additional troops at the southern border. The White House is looking\u00a0at other measures, including blocking migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S., which would almost assuredly result in court challenges. Around 2,000 National Guard troops already serve on the border. The additional troops ordered will operate in areas in California, Arizona and Texas from next Tuesday until Dec. 15, a Pentagon official said. They will not be authorized to detain migrants. Instead,\u00a0they will\u00a0assist Border Patrol personnel on erecting barricades and fencing, conducting helicopter\u00a0and airplane transport and providing assistance to medical teams and patients. Central American migrants rest on the train tracks where the freight train known as \"The Beast\" has for decades carried migrants north, as a thousands strong caravan travel on foot and by road stops between Pijijiapan and Arriaga, Chiapas state in Mexico. (Associated Press) But the Trump administration's policies have drawn sharp criticism from advocates for immigrants. The efforts to curtail migrants seeking asylum could have \"disastrous\u00a0practical implications for our asylum obligations, for our moral and legal obligations,\" said Andrea Guerrero, executive director Alliance San Diego. \"We know that civil rights attorneys are preparing to litigate right now,\" she said. \"They're preparing to litigate right away. I don't know if (Trump) cares if he wins the litigation. He wants to score political points ... it's all part of the same political ploy to stoke fear for political reasons and build more walls.\" The two-mile section of fencing will go a long way in keeping immigrants out of the country, Nielsen said. \"Let me be clear: Walls work,\" Nielsen said. In March, Trump hailed the project in Calexico as the start of his proposed border wall -- the central promise of his 2016 presidential campaign, the Hill reported. In the leadup to the midterm elections, Trump has focused on immigration issues and the approaching caravan. \"I called up the military,\" Trump said Friday at a meeting of young black conservative leaders. \"We're not letting them in, they ought to go back now because we're not.\" The Associated Press contributed to\u00a0this report.",

            "article_content": "White House says there was a 'conversation' about allowing Russian investigators to question Bill Browder; Browder reacts on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.' This is a rush transcript from \"The Story,\" July 18, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: All right, breaking this evening, Bill Browder, who was once the West's biggest investor in Russia, now, after fighting to escape the clutches of Vladimir Putin, fears that he may become part of some kind of exchange underway for 12 Russian Intel agents after he heard this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very Commission headed by Mr. Mueller. We can let them into the country and they will be present to this questioning. And then, we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate and so, we can bring up the Mr. Browder in this particular case. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: And then, today, this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Russian authorities yesterday named several Americans who they want to question, who they claim were involved in Bill Browder's \"crimes\" in their terms. Does President Trump's support that idea, is he open to having U.S. officials questioned by Russia? SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: There was some conversation about it, but there wasn't a commitment made on behalf of the United States and the president will work with his team and we'll let you know if there's an announcement on that front. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is \"The Story.\" Bill Browder was once a successful American businessman working in Russia until 2005 when he was suddenly expelled from the country. His company was seized by Russian authorities and used then in a massive tax fraud scheme. He then hired Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, a name that you have heard a lot of lately to investigate what was going on. Magnitsky was then thrown into a Russian prison. He died there after being beaten and denied medical care. Ever since then, Bill Browder has campaigned to punish Russia. And he says his efforts have made him Vladimir Putin's number-one foreign enemy. Bill Browder joins us now from an undisclosed location this evening. Bill, good evening once again to you. What was your reaction when you heard Vladimir Putin mention your name? I know you spoke about that here the other night. But then, how about what you heard at the White House today? BILL BROWDER, CO-FOUNDER, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I was absolutely appalled by what I heard at the White House today. You know, what Vladimir Putin wants, we know he's a bad guy. We know he's coming after me because -- yes, we're -- because of the Magnitsky Act. But to have -- to have the White House press secretary saying that they haven't decisively ruled it out right off the bat and they're considering this unseemly trade of me and a bunch of good American people for these Russian spies is absolutely appalling and ridiculous. MACCALLUM: The Magnitsky Act was passed by Congress and it put sanctions on Vladimir Putin, on many -- on many of his wealthiest friends, in terms of what travel they could have. This has irritated him to no end and he wants it lifted. And, in fact, that was part of the reason that Natalia Veselnitskaya was in New York to try to get the Magnitsky Act lifted. It also has to do with some adoption rules, that's part of the larger picture of it. But they very much want that overturned, and he's obviously very angry with you. I wonder if you, you know took any comfort from what you heard later today from the State Department here's Heather Nauert. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HEATHER NAUERT, SPOKESPERSON, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: I can't answer on behalf of the White House with regard to that, but what I can tell you is that the overall assertions that have come out of the Russian government are absolutely absurd. The fact that they want to question 11 American citizens and the assertions that the Russian government is making about those American citizens, we do not stand by those assertions -- (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Does that make you feel any better? BROWDER: Well, I feel better knowing -- I mean, that by itself doesn't make me feel better because the President of the United States is still \"considering\" it. But at the end of the day, I'm highly confident that nothing will happen. I mean, and just to dig a little deeper into this whole thing, just so everyone understands what's going on. The people that Vladimir Putin, wants to have interviewed by his Russian secret police are Mike McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia. Kyle Parker, a senior congressional staff member who wrote the Magnitsky Act. Bob Otto, a senior official in the State Department. And then, in addition to that, there are three special agents of the Department of Homeland Security who have had been conducting investigations into Russian money laundering in New York buying property. And so, the idea that the White House, the Donald Trump would be considering handing these people over, and me over to the Russians is just appalling, it's effectively treason to hand over patriotic people who've been trying to do the right thing. And they better come out quickly and walk that one back. Otherwise, this is -- this is truly a litmus test for the Trump administration. MACCALLUM: Yes. Ambassador McFaul has said that he -- you know, hopes that there is immediate pushback publicly to this idea. How -- do you think that -- you know, do you think the president is very familiar with your case and really understands the whole thing? BROWDER: Well, apparently, he spent a quite a bit of time in his private meeting discussing me and my case. So, he shouldn't be unfamiliar with it at this point. MACCALLUM: And the Russian officials, what do you -- what do you hearing about what their understanding is of what may or may not have been discussed in the closed-door meeting? BROWDER: Well, the Russian government has made a very clear announcement, saying here is a list of people that they want to interrogate in the United States and it consists of me, and it consists of a bunch of these people I just mentioned. MACCALLUM: Yes. BROWDER: And they are very clear about it. And the one thing I should point out to you that these -- the story that Vladimir Putin told at the Helsinki summit press conference is the same story that Natalia Veselnitskaya told in the Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016. And so, this has been something that Putin has been sort of peddling through different -- through different mediums for a long time, and now just reached his own mouth to the mouth of -- to the years of the most powerful man in the free world, Donald Trump. MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, as of right now, the White House says that they thought it was a -- you know, an interesting idea. And that was as far as they went with it, they made no commitment to anything. So, it is a quite extraordinary story, and we'll follow it very closely. Bill, thanks again for being here tonight. Good to see you. BROWDER: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Take care in your undisclosed location. All right. So, President Trump, hitting back at critics today saying that no one has been tougher on Russia than his administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we're doing very well. Probably, as well as anybody has ever done with the Russia, and there's been no president ever as tough as I have been on Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Here now, David Bossie, Trump 2016 campaign, deputy campaign manager, and president of citizens united and a Fox News contributor. And Austan Goolsbee, a former chief economic adviser to President Obama, an economics professor at the University of Chicago. Gentlemen, welcome to both of you. Good to have you both here. DAVID BOSSIE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks for having me. MACCALLUM: David, let me start with you. I just want to get your reaction to my discussion with Bill Browder. Doesn't it seem odd to you that the White House hasn't unequivocally come out and said, \"That's never going to happen, we're not sending anyone to you and your investigators are not going to speak to these people.\" BOSSIE: Well, that's exactly what it sounded like Heather Nauert just said, and she speaks for the State Department. So, I don't -- I didn't see much daylight in there. MACCALLUM: Well, she said she couldn't speak for the White House. I'm just -- you know, curious why if -- you know, has been not so clear from the president or from the White House? Why would there be any hesitation in that? BOSSIE: You know, the Brower case is new for me. And I could just tell you that the President Trump would never agree to allow Americans to be questioned. MACCALLUM: Yes. BOSSIE: Or you God forbid sent over to Russia. I think that's not even on the table, I would expect that it's not. MACCALLUM: And Browder's actually a British citizen, he was an American businessman at the time. But I mean, based on everything we've seen from this president who has brought hostages back from other countries, he's made that a priority. It doesn't seem to line up with the way that we've seen him working on these sorts of things and that's why I guess it's raising a number of questions tonight. With regard to the president's statement that he has been tougher than former presidents on the Soviet Union when it comes to the actions, Austan, what do you think about that? AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISER TO BARACK OBAMA: I mean, I assume he was kidding or he didn't know what he was talking about, because that's obviously frame of face should not true at all. MACCALLUM: How so? How so? GOOLSBEE: Well, let's walk through the Christmas list of what Vladimir Putin has wanted for the last 10 years in the West, Donald Trump, has actively done the bidding that Vladimir Putin has wanted. He's undermined NATO in a very significant way. You just saw it today -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: How has he done that he added 30 -- he push them to add $35 to $40 billion dollars in defense spending at NATO? BOSSIE: No, no, come on, Austan. The opposite. GOOLSBEE: OK, let's talk about number one. MACCALLUM: Yes. GOOLSBEE: Today, the president's saying that maybe we wouldn't have to come to the defense of a country in NATO like Montenegro if it was too small and we didn't want to do so. That's the very core agreement of NATO. It completely undermines NATO. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: David, you're shaking your head. I'm going to go one by one here. Because that -- GOOLSBEE: It's not me saying it, the leaders of the NATO country said that he undermined it. BOSSIE: The NATO -- MACCALLUM: David, you want to weigh in on that? BOSSIE: Barack Obama allowed the Russians to meddle. Barack Obama allowed them to invade Crimea. Barack Obama -- you can laugh. GOOLSBEE: Oh, boy. BOSSIE: Barack Obama allowed the Syrians to gasp children. The red line that Barack Obama talked about was not accurate. He's -- he lied to the American people and he'd let Putin do whatever he wanted. That's the -- those are the facts. MACCALLUM: You know, when you look, you know -- (CROSSTALK) GOOLSBEE: Let me -- David, do you think this was a successful summit? MACCALLUM: Hold on Austan. GOOLSBEE: He went to a summit in which he is talking about potentially extraditing the U.S. -- the former U.S. ambassador to Russia. BOSSIE: That's not true. It's not true. GOOLSBEE: To Russia. BOSSIE: It's not true. MACCALLUM: All right. Well, hold on guys. (CROSSTALK) GOOLSBEE: You just -- look, I don't know what to tell you other than what he himself said. MACCALLUM: Yes, and hold on. Austan, no, but, Austan, Austan -- you know, just take a breath for one second. GOOLSBEE: OK. MACCALLUM: You know, in terms of actual facts on the ground, and what -- and what we have seen happen, this president gave lethal aid to the Ukraine. President Obama symptom MREs. You know, so you can talk in broad terms about being dissatisfied with the -- with the attitude that you saw in Helsinki, and I think, you would find a lot of people that would agree with that. But we have to -- you know, deal in the actual facts on the ground. (CROSSTALK) GOOLSBEE: OK, what's (INAUDIBLE) couple of specifics. MACCALLUM: President Obama said that he would -- he would consider easing up on the missile shield. Can you imagine how that felt to the Eastern European countries when they heard that? And in fact, the missile shield is still in the works and planned to be done by 2020 under this president? GOOLSBEE: Let's walk through specific if you'd like to. MACCALLUM: OK. The U.S. Congress passed a sanctions on Russia to punish them for their behavior. The Trump administration has actively not enforced the sanctions. BOSSIE: The sanctions are still all on. GOOLSBEE: And they -- when first said they were going to evict the Russian diplomats, and then turned around and said that they would allow the Russians to replace those diplomats with other diplomats. So, when you're saying that the president is being the toughest president on Russia, it's obviously not true, you don't have to make claims that are completely over the top falls in order to say that he's doing a -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: I'm just literally going by the facts. The money spent, the strengthening of NATO, the increase in aid to Ukraine, you know, if you're -- if you're one of those people -- (CROSSTALK) GOOLSBEE: When you say he strengthen NATO with the leaders of our NATO allies universally agree that he undermined NATO and they been extremely disturb. BOSSIE: Theresa May. GOOLSBEE: So, why is it that you say that strengthening NATO? MACCALLUM: All right. I been hear a lot. So, David, I want to give you the final thought here. David, go ahead. BOSSIE: Look, Trump derangement syndrome is a real thing. We see this now. We see that Brennan, the Obama CIA director who is responsible for allowing the meddling in the Syrian gassing of children. This guy voted for a communist, now we find out. We have problems that President Trump inherited that he is trying to fix. The Obama administration and their ilk are doing everything they can to undermine him. They lie, they will cheat, they will steal, they want to basically, eliminate the election of November of 2016. That's all they think about, that's all they can do. MACCALLUM: Alright, guys. Thanks, good debate. Good to have you both here tonight. So, still, to come, Mandalay Bay has been criticized for allowing Stephen Paddock to load an enormous amount of firepower into his room there before unleashing it on hundreds of innocent people below. But now, Mandalay Bay is suing the victims. A heated debate coming up tonight. Plus, prosecutors say that she offered sex in return for a job here in the United States and then, proceeded to infiltrate GOP circles. What we are now learning tonight about the woman known as Maria Butina. Do you think that's her real name? Michael Isikoff is joining me with some of what he's done. He is been writing about her actually for a long time, he's up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: She once appeared in GQ Russia back in 2014. Where's -- let's take a look at that picture. There she is in GQ Russia with a couple of guns and a fancy leather jacket. But today she was wearing an orange jumpsuit and she pled not guilty to charges of acting as an agent of a foreign government. She's going to be held in jail. The judge says that she has no ties to America and therefore she is a serious flight risk saying that she could hop into any Russian diplomatic vehicle and she would be out of their hands. So the prosecutors say that this 29-year-old allegedly offered to have sex with an unnamed individual in return for a job in the United States and that she gained access to an extensive network of U.S. persons to influence political activities in the United States by living with and at one point and none of the people in this picture are implicated in this so let's take them off the camera. But there is a suggestion that she had a relationship with an individual and may have moved in with someone in order to gain access as well. So here is Jack Barsky former KGB Agent on the story last night when he asked -- when I asked him if he believed that she is indeed a Russian spy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Is she is a spy, what we would call a spy? JACK BARSKY, FORMER KGB AGENT: I would think so, albeit most likely in an amateur. I'm calling her an amateur, I also have to compliment her because he got a lot further than I as a trained professional got. I mean, she made contact with a lot of people that are and would be of interest to Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So that, of course, is what spies tried to do. Remember Anna Chapman who even kind of looks a little bit like Maria Butina and the ring of Russian spies who were caught back in 2010. Their story was the basis for the series The Americans. Michael Isikoff is the Chief Investigative Correspondent at Yahoo! News, and Co-Author of Russian Roulette. Michael, welcome back to the program. You wrote about Maria Butina in your book. Were you surprised to hear that she had been arrested? MICHAEL ISIKOFF, CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT, YAHOO! NEWS: Not really. I mean, Maria Butina, by the way, is how it's pronounced -- MACCALLUM: Butina. Thank you. ISIKOFF: -- has been on my radar screen and a number of others for quite some time you know, during the 2016 campaign. She kept showing up at various events. She was photographed with Scott Walker at an NRA event shortly after he announced. And also -- and I we do write about this in Russian Roulette, just a few weeks after Donald Trump declared his candidacy for president she showed up at an event. He was speaking out in Las Vegas Trump called on her during a Q&A session and she asked about -- MACCALLUM: We have that, Michael. Let me just jump in for one second because we can show that. ISIKOFF: Sure. MACCALLUM: Let's play that. ISIKOFF: Sure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARIA BUTINA, RUSSIAN SPY: Do you want to continue the politics of sanctions that are damaging of both economy? TRUMP: I believe I would get along very nicely with Putin, OK? And I mean, where we have the strength. I don't think you'd need the sanctions. I think that we would get along very, very well. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I mean, she was clearly doing her job. She was getting -- ISIKOFF: She was doing her job -- right. And look, Russia sanctions was hardly at the forefront of the American political dialogue at that moment. That's not what Republican candidates were talking much about but she got Trump on the record saying he'd do away with sanctions. That was some -- MACCALLUM: But President Obama was pressing sanctions at that point, right? ISIKOFF: Oh, well, he had already imposed sanctions, yes. And there's -- Trump is saying if you elect me you wouldn't need the sanctions. MACCALLUM: All right, let's talk a little bit about the back channels that she was trying to establish and whether or not your -- from your reporting she was able to really get anywhere with that. And part of the investigation is whether or not there was funneling of money. I mean, in my mind she's sort of like the human expression of you know of a bot or a tweet or all of the other efforts that they made. She's a much more traditional expression of that. In fact, over the last, you know decade they've arrested 20 spies who have been doing exactly what she was trying to do. ISIKOFF: Right, right. Look, she was there as we write in the book, I mean, she surprised a lot of people because she kept showing up at NRA conventions, at CPAC conferences, at national prayer breakfasts, and you know there are a number of people who kept wondering why is this woman always here? What is she after? We --- there's a Republican lobbyist who she was sort of coming on to and this lobbyist was wondering what's going on here? Why is this Russian woman you know, trying to befriend me and being so (INAUDIBLE) of what I have to say? MACCALLUM: Yes, I wonder why. I wonder what she might possibly want. Oh my god. Yes. ISIKOFF: But look, there's a serious part to this story and that is her handler, her boss, and that's that guy Alexander Torshin. He is a Russian central banker, deputy governor was a high-level official in the in the Duma, in Putin's party, and an accused money launderer. The Spanish national police had wiretap on him talking to the head of an organ -- Russian organized crime gang leader in Spain in which their leader is talking about him as El Padrino. Torshin is the real target here. He's the guy you got a look for. MACCALLUM: He's the guy in the picture that we're showing right now next to her. Michael, thank you. Good to see you tonight. ISIKOFF: Sure enough. Any time. MACCALLUM: So New Jersey, Senator Bob Menendez has been plagued by scandal and now his New Jersey Senate race is looking like it could actually become a toss-up. And 58 concert goers massacred, hundreds of people injured, and now Mandalay Bay is turning the tables on the Las Vegas victims. One of the survivors is up next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT EGLET, ATTORNEY FOR LAS VEGAS VICTIMS: They have no interest whatsoever in the victims. They haven't -- what their number one and only priority is their money. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Fifty-eight people were murdered and more than 500 were injured in the Las Vegas massacre last October. And now more than 1,000 survivors of the deadliest shooting in American history are being sued by MGM Resorts. The strange twist is sparking in major backlash. Is this heartless or practical or maybe both? Jonathan Hunt is live in our West Coast Newsroom with the story. Hi, Jonathan! JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Martha! It certainly seems odd on the face of it that the company would sue victims but it's all about MGM protecting itself from what could potentially be a series of devastating financial claims. The company says it has \"no liability of any kind to defendants.\" Those defendants being some of the hundreds of people who were shocked, wounded, and traumatized that terrible night when a gunman open fire from Mandalay Bay. MGM sight say 2002 federal act that gives liability protection to any company that uses \"anti-terrorism technology\" or services that can \"help prevent and respond to mass violence.\" MGM says it's protected from liability because it used a security company certified by the Department of Homeland Security. And in a statement, MGM added \"years of drawn out litigation and hearings are not in the best interest of victims, the community and those still healing.\" Now, the act MGM is relying on here cost in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. The FBI has not called the Vegas shootings as an act of terrorism and in fact still hasn't found a motive behind the massacre. Victims and their lawyers are outraged. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EGLET: This is the most reprehensible conduct by a defendant under circumstances like this I've ever witnessed in more than 30 years. (END VIDEO CLIP) HUNT: And they argue that as Stephen Paddock brought his huge arsenal of weapons into the Mandalay Bay, MGM should have seen the warning signs and should not be protected legally by that 2002 federal safety act. EGLET: It wasn't meant to provide immunity for a hotel-casino who had woefully inefficient security process that didn't you know, all the bells and whistles that were going off that they didn't catch. HUNT: Now, the courts will decide the legal issues. The court of public opinion, Martha, seems to have rolled already against MGM. Martha? MACCALLUM: It would be damaging as well. Thank you very much, Jonathan. Brian Claypool, an attorney who was there the night of the massacre, he represents more than 75 of the survivors and Mark Eiglarsh a Criminal Defense Attorney and former Prosecutor. Gentlemen, welcome, both of you. Mark, you were there. We talked shortly after that night about how horrific it was for you. You know, how does MGM turn lawsuits against these victims and get away with it? BRIAN CLAYPOOL, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Hi, Martha. Thanks for having me back. Yes, we talked right after the shooting and I will tell you that the announcement of these lawsuits against the victims of the Vegas shooting has re-victimized and re-traumatized everybody that was part of that shooting, including myself. My question to MGM is how deep into the swamp do they want to go by suing victims? Now how low do they want to kick the victims? In my opinion, both as a victim of the shooting and a lawyer. And actually I'm co-counseling with Robert Eglet on these cases. I mean, this is a bullying tactic and an intimidation tactic, Martha, to dissuade or discourage these victims from filing this lawsuit. MACCALLUM: Yes. CLAYPOOL: Plain and simple. They didn't have to do this. MACCALLUM: Mark, I can understand if MGM thinks that, you know, they can win this suit, but suing the victims? What are they suing them for? MARK EIGLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: A P.R. nightmare. I will not defend them on P.R. grounds at all. My heart goes out to the victims and I can understand why Brian and the others are feeling angry. However, Brian is a tremendous trial lawyer, he knows that your job when you're defending someone is to do everything you possibly can to win. And in this particular case they cite a statute that seems to be created for this very scenario. They didn't hire Justin Bieber's bodyguards or a couple of hells angels. They hired a company that was certified by the Department of Homeland Security in the exact acts that are protected underneath the statute. I'm not sure how a judge doesn't grant this. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: All right. But let me ask you this. Because after this horrific night we talked about the security that other casinos have in place in Las Vegas and the Wynn Casino as I remember had much tougher security in terms of what you can bring into those rooms and how long you can let them -- you know, no one enter your room for days and days. So if you can prove -- can you prove, Brian, that they were negligent because other resorts have handled it much better? CLAYPOOL: You can do that and you can also the way we are going to do it also is, for example, a couple weeks ago, there was evidence of three years ago, convicted felon is in a hotel room at the Mandalay Bay with mass weapons. So we can use -- we can use prior reports of crime at all the MGM casinos and try to get an evidence of other crime occurring on the property from other casinos to prove negligence. But one thing I want to respond to Mark with-- (CROSSTALK) EIGLARSH: Martha? CLAYPOOL: -- is I don't think this is -- this is not a slam dunk. Because the spirit of this 2002 law, Martha, was to prevent terrorism. The definition of terrorism is violence for a political gain. This had nothing to do with terrorism and the last one I want to make is-- (CROSSTALK) EIGLARSH: But that's not accurate. CLAYPOOL: Even is a judge -- but even if -- but listen, Martha. MACCALLUM: Mark, last point. Go ahead. CLAYPOOL: Even if a judge does say this is terrorism-- EIGLARSH: The definition of terrorism, Brian-- MACCALLUM: Go ahead, Mark. Go ahead. EIGLARSH: Brian? CLAYPOOL: Even if -- let me finish. EIGLARSH: The definition of terrorism in this scenario is any unlawful act, and that's what this was, inside the United States, which it was, that causes mass destruction, injury or other loss. It seems to fit exactly the definition, Brian, as much as I feel for you and your client legally the judge will not consider the motion sympathy. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: All right. We got to leave it there, guys. CLAYPOOL: Mark -- Mark? MACCALLUM: Gentlemen, thank you. CLAYPOOL: You can't-- MACCALLUM: We got to leave it there. We'll pick it up. We'll stay on it. Good to see you both tonight. Thank you very much. So coming up, more Democrats run cities like Chicago pushing some usual liberal policies for quite a long time bordering on socialism in some cases like guaranteed income for all. So where are they headed? Jonah Goldberg on that. And President Obama's return to the spotlight ahead. Plus, cleared of corruption and back on the campaign trail, but this time New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez may have some competition on his hands. His challenger is Republican Bob Hugin and he joins me next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bob Menendez chose a life in politics serving his donors, getting indicted. Bob Hugin chose a life of service. He's the better Bob for Senate. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, D-N.J.: To those who were digging my political grave so that they could jump into my seat, I know who you are and I won't forget you. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Remember that? So less than four months until the 2018 midterms, I think it's about 100 days and the New Jersey Senate race is in a statistical dead heat according to a local poll and it's starting to get some attention because there's a real chance that the traditionally safe Democratic seat could possibly for the first time since 1972 possibly go red. So you've got two-term Senator Bob Menendez who was cleared this year of corruption charges. It was basically the jury in both cases, both trials did not reach a decision, they deadlocked. It's a tight race with Bob Hugin, a former drug company executive and CEO of Celgene. So Bob is here live in just a moment. But first, Chris Stirewalt, Fox News politics editor for more on this race. So this could potentially get interesting, Chris, which, you know, it doesn't usually happen in New Jersey. CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: Well, New Jersey politics are interesting. MACCALLUM: That's for sure. STIREWALT: Yes. But usually not in good ways. Look, here's the thing, it's a tough year for Republicans in New Jersey and in a lot of places and a lot of blue states and let's be honest from the start, this is a long shot. This is a hard one. MACCALLUM: Yes. STIREWALT: But you have in Mr. Hugin what Republicans love to see. They have this year a lot of places where they are spending money to try to gain seats in the Senate. This is one where you have a person who has money of his own and has a donor base that he can call on to help them out and he can become instantly viable essentially in this race. Menendez is badly damaged. He was not really cleared-cleared in the sense that prosecutors eventually said look, we are dropping what we're doing. They didn't say we think he's just peachy keen. What they said was we can't get there from here and we give up. And that's going to hang over him. And also resentment inside his party toward him for the way he did this. It would have been much better for him for Democrats to have stepped aside and let somebody without the baggage run. He's forcing it and now there is some division there. MACCALLUM: Yes. Indeed, there is. So what's the vulnerability for Bob Hugin? STIREWALT: He is a Republican, it is New Jersey. The brand in New Jersey right now for Republican is bad so he has to be a different kind of Republican to fit in, in New Jersey, but it has worked in the past. Chris Christie, et cetera. So things are possible and we are definitely watching this race in a way that we normally wouldn't. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: We are watching this race. Thank you, my friend. Good to see you tonight. STIREWALT: You bet. MACCALLUM: Thanks for being here, Chris. So we invited incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Menendez to join us tonight. He had a prior engagement and that invitation is open. Joining me now is Bob Hugin, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in New Jersey and former CEO of Celgene Pharmaceuticals. Good to see you, Bob. Good to have you here tonight. Let's take a look at -- we looked in the tease at your ad against Bob Menendez. But let's look at what he is running against you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When the cause is just, we don't give in. When the odds are long, we don't give up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bob has always made us proud. Always. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We cannot let the dark cloud cast by the president define us as a country. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: It doesn't mention you a whole lot in there. But what do you make of the race you are up against? BOB HUGIN, R-SENATE CANDIDATE, NEW JERSEY: Well, first of all, I think long shot is the wrong characterization. The two most recent polls are within the margin of error. It's a dead heat right now. The people of New Jersey are realizing they have a real choice this year. MACCALLUM: You are a former marine. You were the first to go to college in your family. And you know, I think a lot of people look at you and say, you know, he's a wealthy man, very successful. You put $15 million of your own money-- HUGIN: Yes. MACDONALD: -- into this race. And so I can imagine in a debate environment, because I moderate a lot of debates, that that's how he's going to go at you that you are the rich guy and you are funding your own campaign, kind of like Donald Trump. HUGIN: Yes. Listen, as you said, I lived the American dream. I was born in Jersey City, raised in Union City. First of my family to go to college. Serve the Marine Corps, served my country. I went to a struggling company, six weeks of cash left and now one of the leading companies in the world fighting cancer. So we're going to make a difference here. And the other thing is, let's be clear. In Washington you never see bipartisanship. Senate ethics committee, Democrats and Republicans, Senator Menendez violated the law, abused the power of his office, disgraced the Senate, it's time for change. It fails. MACCALLUM: All right. So how do you convince Democratic voters in New Jersey, because there are more of them than there are Republicans, that they should take a chance on you, and will you ask President Trump to campaign with you? HUGIN: Well, first of all, the people of New Jersey are speaking. I go to all over. They realize that not only has he morally offended them and embarrass them, he's been in Washington for 25 years, 16 years with a Democratic president in New Jersey is dead last. We get the least back from any state in the country of the percentage of what we send and it's headed in the wrong direction. Its failed leadership. We are going to put New Jersey first. MACCALLUM: So you didn't answer my question. Do you want Trump to campaign with you? HUGIN: Listen, this race is Bob Menendez against Bob Hugin. I want everybody to come and support me as long as it's about New Jersey issues and the issues that we are fighting for, for all the people of New Jersey. MACCALLUM: And what about Chris Christie, would you like him to campaign with you? HUGIN: Again, I want anybody who believes in the values that I have from New Jersey. I'm listening to New Jerseyans. It's clear what they want. They want a more affordable state. We need to be supported better in Trenton and in Washington. And it's about Menendez versus Hugin. MACCALLUM: I live in New Jersey, which, you know, I think maybe our viewers are aware of. You've got a lot of people who want to leave the state. They are getting taxed out of the state. A lot of businesses. So I would imagine that that's one of the areas that you are going to want to drive home. HUGIN: Yes. Listen, it's a shame. You want to be able to have your children -- I'm lucky, I have three kids. We raised our kids in New Jersey. My daughter works at Giovanni Yogurt here in New York. Both my sons are officers in the Marine Corps. I want them to be able to come back to New Jersey but it's so unaffordable now people are planning their exit. We got to change. We've got to see the light at the end of the tunnel and say we are going to have Trenton and Washington focus on making New Jersey affordable again. MACCALLUM: Bob, thank you very much. We'll be watching. Interesting to meet you. Thanks for being here tonight. (CROSSTALK) HUGIN: Great to be with you. Thank you. MACCALLUM: You bet. So coming up next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: I'm not being alarmist, I am simply stating the facts. Look around. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: Strongman politics are assented. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So is that true? Are those the facts? Jonah Goldberg is up next and says the rebirth of populism and nationalism is destroying American democracy. He's always so cheery and he joins me next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Look around. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: Strongman politics are ascendant suddenly. Whereby elections in some pretense of democracy are maintained, the form of it, but those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That was President Obama stepping back into the spotlight this week and taking some shots, without saying his name, at President Trump, suggesting that strongman politics, as you heard him say they are, are on the rise and perhaps some of our Democratic freedoms are at stake. Joining me now, Jonah Goldberg, Fox News contributor and author of the new book \"Suicide of the West.\" Who better to talk to about democracy and the future of America? Hi, Jonah. Good to see you tonight. JONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Martha. MACCALLUM: So what about this argument that strongman are ascendant? GOLDBERG: Well, look, I think you're probably right that Barack Obama was, as the kids say, sub tweeting Donald Trump a little bit. You know, he didn't use his name but that people were supposed to take away that association. But it is worth pointing out that strongman politics is ascendant in large parts of the globe. There are lots of countries that are looking at the Putin Model, the Chinese model. Viktor Orban in Hungary has talked about how liberal Democratic capitalism may be has run its course. In Mexico they just elected a big populist demagogue guy. We look at what happened in Venezuela, which should be a cautionary tale. The rhetoric about how democracy and liberal democratic capitalism is fading in a lot, in many parts of the world these days and I do think that you can make the argument that some of that is happening in the United States too. I don't think that Donald Trump is a strongman. I do think he likes a lot of strong men, or says nice things about them, but that's a little different thing than saying that Donald Trump is a strongman. MACCALLUM: We had (Inaudible) Steven Pinker a while ago. I mean, he talked about the rise of democracy, actually, and how the situation for most people has become better in the world in recent decades. He said now you've got -- he said, you know, when he was a kid you had about 60 democracies in the world. Now you have 100 and that this notion that the world is becoming a less great place to live is just simply not true when you look at the economies around the globe. Democracy is going around the globe. The decline in disease around the globe. That it actually is a much more optimistic picture than President Obama wants to paint. GOLDBERG: No. Look, I agree with that and you know, Steven Pinker makes a very similar argument to one of the ones that I make in my book. That, you know, in terms of human prosperity, this is the greatest moment to be alive in all of human history. We actually, right now in this moment are living in the greatest moment of poverty alleviation in the history of humanity. But at the same time, we don't teach people to be grateful for this. We don't teach people to be thankful for this. Instead, we get on the left and on certain parts of the right, the opposite of gratitude, which is resentment and entitlement. MACCALLUM: Well-- GOLDBERG: And as Ronald Reagan -- as Ronald Reagan said, you know, tyranny is never more than one generation away because we don't inherit it in our blood, it's got to be fought for and taught in every generation and we're not doing a great job of that. MACCALLUM: Well, you know, I thought it was interesting when the president -- when President Obama was talking about strongman, you know, and I think about another way of looking at that is that a strongman, you know, some might make the argument, conservatives might make the argument, that the strongman is the government and that the government has grown and grown and grown and encroached on people's freedoms. We have encouraged more people to go into food stamps. We've expanded -- you know, now we are talking about guaranteed income in Chicago so that -- maybe it's not embodied in one human being, but that the government is a fearful strongman for many people. GOLDBERG: I agree with that entirely. And I think that this is one of the ironies is when you hear from so many people on the sort of the Democratic left in America, they are constantly saying Donald Trump is a strongman, we don't need strongman. What we need is socialism, which is basically giving millions of bureaucrat's strongman powers over their lives. And I do think that one of the best arguments for Donald Trump's election was this idea that the government establishment, the globalist, whatever you want to call it, were having too much power over our lives and we needed someone to come in and smash all of that up. And to the extent the things that Donald Trump is doing to smash a lot of that stuff up I support a great deal. MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, also when you look at the rise of Kim Jong-un, when you look at what happened with China over the course of the Obama years, the expansion into the South China Seas, the huge expansion of -- their, you know, trade -- their robbing of our intellectual property all of that. You look at Putin moving into Crimea, into Ukraine. All of that happened on President Obama's watch. So it's difficult to argue that the strongman has become more active since he left. GOLDBERG: No. I think -- I think one of the reasons why though, that a lot of those things happen was in part because Barack Obama had a theory about how the world works that was in direct defiance of how the world actually works, and so he showed weakness to strongman around the world and strongman did what strongman do. MACCALLUM: You are a strongman, but in a different way. Jonah, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much. GOLDBERG: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Thanks for being here. GOLDBERG: Good to be here. MACCALLUM: So still ahead tonight, a sneak peek about what the new Air Force One could look like, and we have a huge debate over whether or not it should be changed. Stick around, we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So President Trump says that Air Force One needs a makeover, the iconic baby blue to be ramped up with a more patriotic red, white, and blue which the president says would be more American. The changes are scheduled to take effect in 2024. Here is one person's interpretation of what it could potentially look like. According to Axios, \"I don't like this particular version it looks like a hockey helmet to me. You know how goalies paint their helmets. That's what it looks like.\" So here's what they said on Twitter. Russ Bourne says this. \"I think it should have been red, white, and blue to begin with.\" Eric Snyder disagrees. He says it must be left as it is. The original iconic colors the plane stands for freedom and that symbol is highly recognizable around the world. So here's tonight's quote from President George W. Bush on the last flight for Air Force One tail number 27,000 question. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT: This plane tail number 27,000 bore the name of Air Force One for 444 missions and more than one million miles. Today it carried a president for the last time. And soon it will be taking its last flight. It will carry no more presidents but it will carry forever the spirit of American democracy. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I think they should leave it the way it is but I don't think the president will listen to me or probably any of the Twitter folks. That is our story for tonight. Thanks for being with us, everybody. Tucker Carlson is coming up next live from Washington, D.C. Have a good night, everybody. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" October 3, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York, and this is \"The Five.\" The FBI probe into Brett Kavanaugh could be finished in a matter of hours. The bureau expected to wrap things up as early as today. Sources telling Fox News a single copy of the report will be sent to Capitol Hill and the White House to read and then it's going to be kept in a safe in the senate judiciary committee. This all comes as Senator Chuck Grassley is demanding answers to stunning new allegations that contradict Christine Blasey Ford's testimony. An ex-boyfriend claims Ford helped a friend prep for a polygraph test, contradicting her senate testimony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RACHEL MITCHELL, PROSECUTOR: Have you ever had discussions with anyone, besides your attorneys, on how to take a polygraph? CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, KAVANAUGH ACCUSER: Never. MITCHELL: And I don't just mean countermeasures, but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that. FORD: No. MITCHELL: Have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test? FORD: Never. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Now, Ford's friend is denying being held for a lie detector test. Meantime, President Trump isn't backing down from defending Kavanaugh from Democratic attacks. He's swinging back harder than ever. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDEN DONALD TRUMP: They've been trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh since the very first, second he was announced. So many different charges, guilty until proven innocent, that's very dangerous for our country. And a man's life is in tatters. A man's life is shattered. They destroy people. They want to destroy people. These are really evil people. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: And after the bombshell story about Kavanaugh throwing ice cubes at a bar, the New York Times is out with another decades-old report about the Supreme Court nominee. The Times printing what appears to be a sarcastic letter from Kavanaugh preparing for beach week in the summer of 1983 where he warns about him and his friends being loud and getting drunk. All right, Greg, this -- I guess this is a sworn statement by the ex- boyfriend of Ford, and it's riddled with bombshells here. Never brought up anything about Kavanaugh, never his name, never brought up about being sexually abused. He witnessed her prepping this friend of hers, Monica, for a polygraph exam. She flew on planes all the time. Not afraid of small spaces. And when he caught her cheating, she ended up keeping his credit card and then spending lavishly on it, then lied about it afterwards. And then once it was said that he was going to press charges, then she owned up to it. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: You know, the key thing to take from this is that two can play at this game in the court of public opinion, OK? We've sat here and watched uncorroborated accusations, so it's now the pendulum is swinging back and there happens to be information out there. That -- the media is saying that Trumps comments about Ford were a mockery or an attack are the same media who thought Matt Damon's ridicule of Kavanaugh was sparkling and brilliant and daring. And yet, they find that Trump said something yesterday and he called it mockery or an attack when all he did was point out a discrepancy. What Trump did, if that was an attack to you, then you really do live in a bubble because if you go home, or you go to a bar, or you talk to somebody at the gym, what Trump said is exactly the opinions of everybody at home going, some of her stuff has holes in it, that stuff about having one drink but not -- knowing she only had one drink but not remembering everything else. The common sense of his -- what would you call, the rally Trump. The common sense of the rally Trump reflects most of America and he's revealing the contrast of the public and private expression about this case, that so many people publicly will say she's credible and compelling, but then they go home and they go, dude, she's not making sense on a lot of it. Remember, he said at the beginning, compelling. But then when he gets to rally Trump, he becomes like everybody else and he says, you know what? She's -- there's some incredible things. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: When you come to rally Trump, what he does is he feeds red meat to the red base. GUTFELD: No, that's -- for America. WILLIAMS: And you're going to go after the press. The media is doing this. Let me just tell you, Greg, pick up the paper. You'll see that people like Susan Collins are saying this is plain wrong. GUTFELD: Because they're scared of the media. WILLIAMS: Let me finish for a second. GUTFELD: Oh, you interrupted me. WILLIAMS: I did not. I respond to you. I'm saying -- and you hear Lindsey Graham saying, well, there may be holes, but you know what, Mr. President, knock it off. GUTFELD: They're wrong. WILLIAMS: . this is not helpful. GUTFELD: They're wrong. WILLIAMS: Let me tell you something, Greg, this kind of going after someone when they give you a -- burying their soul about something that's traumatizing. GUTFELD: Like Kavanaugh. WILLIAMS: . it's not helpful. That women get a message from this that they're being told shut up. GUTFELD: Women actually agreed with Trump at that rally. They know, they applauded. WILLIAMS: How about -- yes. How about when the Catholic Church abuses people, and the power structure ignores them and protects the priests. GUTFELD: What about the Catholic Church? (CROSSTALK) JEANINE PIRRO, GUEST CO-HOST: Women at the elevator. They go to the elevator of Jeff Flake, and if you support Brett Kavanaugh you're not listening to me. Well, you know what? If you were molested, and we now know their source of the people, you were molested, go after the guy who molested you. Don't assume that Brett Kavanaugh should carry the burden for everyone who has suffered, every woman, from sexual abuse. WILLIAMS: That is not what we're talking about, Judge. Even Jeff Flake said what Trump did last night, no time, no place for remarks like that because it is insulting. And the lawyer for Ford said this is why women don't come forward. This why you don't tell your dad, don't tell your mom. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: You brought up a simple discrepancy. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Sarah Sanders was asked about this today at the briefing. Let's hear what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It wasn't anything other than the president stating facts, and facts that were laid out in the prosecutor's memo that she put forward to the senate. I think it is absolutely disgraceful what they've done and exploited this process. They've exploited Dr. Ford. They're exploiting all the women that have come out to make any type of accusation. This isn't the process that should have been done, and certainly everybody deserves to be heard, but that includes Judge Kavanaugh. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Well, I've just got a fresh text from mom. And I'm going to have to go to you. Mom said, I sincerely hope that Dana establishes the tone tonight regarding attacking the victim. So here you go, Dana. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, the thing is -- I was -- it was interesting -- I think Sarah Sanders -- she represents her boss well. Nobody talks like Trump. Nobody can out-Trump, Trump. So you're the press secretary and you -- I think she did her best there in trying to say -- this is what he was trying to say, what President Trump was saying was basically reading from the transcript of the hearing, but it's the tone. Like your mom said, for me to set the tone. So the president has a tone that does sound like he's going after you. That's like for me, like you know I hate the nicknames. I get it that they worked and that they're very effective. I do, though, wonder about the strategy later on because Flake, Murkowski, Collins, they're sincerely polite, like they would never say this kind of thing. And so now, they're already under a ton of pressure. They're waiting for this FBI reports. The president needs their vote. And I just think, like from a strategy standpoint, do you get the country with you and lose those three votes and then end up winning in 2020 because people are so mad? Or do those people, those senators, wait for the FBI report, if it's clean, if they have no reason not to vote for him if the FBI report comes back and is fine. PIRRO: But I really believe, Dana, that Donald Trump always has both situations covered. He's got the public situation covered and the political. And that's why he plays to his base, and then he also is trying to leverage however way he can with these senators. Flake, initially. PERINO: Well, I think he'll end up with. PIRRO: . maybe. PERINO: I think that -- even if he loses a Flake. PIRRO: Right. PERINO: . does he pick up a Manchin? Does he pick up somebody else along the way, McCaskill, somebody like that. WATTERS: And I don't think. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I don't think what we saw at the rally last night, that was not mocking Trump. GUTFELD: No. WATTERS: We've all seen Trump mocking. That is very lite of mocking if anything. GUTFELD: Two can play this game. We've seen the media put their spotlight on Avenatti and questionable client, and let it ride. And so -- then you have Trump just bring up a simple discrepancy and you call that, like, attacking? Give me a break. WILLIAMS: I'll give you a break. That was attack. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: So in other words, every woman in America who's gone. GUTFELD: It's not every woman. WILLIAMS: Oh, they're all snowflakes. Want you just shut up, you know, move on, nothing to see here. GUTFELD: That's not what it is. WILLIAMS: This to me is also part of the issue with the FBI, because right now -- remember, the president said he found Ford credible. That's the president's language. GUTFELD: That's polite. WILLIAMS: And then he comes now -- and instead, now he changes his tune because he wants to play to you, Greg. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Juan, Juan. (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: Every woman in America who has been a victim of a sexual assault remembers more than Christine Blasey Ford. WILLIAMS: I don't know. PIRRO: I know. I did this for 30 years. WILLIAMS: Fine. But I'm just saying, you think you're speaking to every woman. PIRRO: No, what I'm telling you is that for you to say that -- because Donald Trump is pointing out inconsistencies in her own testimony that he's suggesting to other women who've been victimized that, hey, look, we're not going to believe you, it's absolutely not the case. The women who've been victimized are asking the same question. Why do I remember when I was rape? Why do I remember. WILLIAMS: let me tell you. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Most women who were victimized don't even report it because. PIRRO: No kidding. GUTFELD: They fear Donald Trump. (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: What they fear is not the President of the United States and the politics. What they fear is the abuser. WILLIAMS: How about a sham investigation and what you don't interview the victim? WATTERS: How about a sham hearing? How about that? Does the truth about Brett Kavanaugh even matter to Democrats or Juan? Senator Spartacus with a stunning admission, up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Some Democrats making waves amid the Brett Kavanaugh drama. Senator Cory Booker, staunch backer of the FBI investigation into Trump's Supreme Court nominee, now suggesting that his fellow lawmakers ditch Kavanaugh without regard to what the probe reveals. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: My hope is that beyond the vicious partisan rancor that is going on, beyond the accusations, we don't lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country. And ultimately ask ourselves the question, is this the right person to sit on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment? And then, ultimately, not whether he's innocent or guilty. This is not a trial. But ultimately, have enough questions been raised that we should not move on to another candidate? (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: In addition, former Secretary of State John Kerry, he's busy defending the late Ted Kennedy, the former senator scandals have been brought up, of course, during the Kavanaugh nomination. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY: People have been critical through the years with -- and he was critical of himself. He stood up and owned moments where he knew he'd stepped over the line. So, I think that - - and he wasn't about to be nominated to a lifetime position. In fact, he said to the people of Massachusetts, if you think I shouldn't stay here, then, you know, and he took those returns and then he was elected another six times. That's a very different thing from a lifetime confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: So, judge, let's take the conversation to Cory Booker. I'm sure my colleagues here want me to call him Spartacus. But let's take the conversation there because what he's saying is he's not even arguing that the FBI probe is being sort of bull rush and limited by the White House. He's saying that this is not a criminal trial. This is about Kavanaugh's credibility, his character, judicial temperament of a man who would sit on the Supreme Court for decades to come. What do you think? PIRRO: Well, I don't agree with him. I think that will be a surprise to all of you. Look, here's the bottom line, the man was accused of being a sexual predator, of being a gang rapist, and, you know, causing women to get drunk, and he's not supposed to lose his cool for even a little bit. The truth is he's been on the circuit court for 12 years. He's got the temperament. And I don't know how many people out there been in courtrooms, but I've spent 30 years in them. Judges flip out all the time, and that is not what I consider flipping out, what Kavanaugh did. But I think the saddest part of all this is that they're standing up and saying it doesn't matter what the truth is. There's enough smell here. Let's get rid of him. But what is this smell? The only smell I get here is about someone who doesn't know the fundamentals about an issue that she kept quiet about. It's about a guy who was accused by three women, and how this guy found three women who would wait 35 years to admit that they were sexually assaulted by him blows my mind. He must be a genius because all of these women now have suffered from repressed memory. And in the end, they're now coming out to attack him. It's all politics, period. End of the story. WILLIAMS: What do you think, Jesse? WATTERS: I agree with Booker. It's not a trial. It's a show trial, Juan. Think about it. There's no crime scene. There's no physical evidence. There's no corroborating witnesses. There's nothing. There's absolutely nothing. So with that, what you have is people raising questions. Anybody can raise questions, Juan. You can raise questions about everything. But you know what? When you raise questions, you have to find answers. How do you find answers? You get the facts. Senate investigators are looking for the facts. Unfortunately, for Democrats, they don't have any facts. There are no facts on their side right now. And if you look at the context of -- let's just say, the rolling stone rape hoax, how in the context of that can any Democrat say I have absolutely no doubt about what happened with judge Kavanaugh. These things happen all the time. There has to be some doubt there. Look at the Russian collusion situation. What happens if Mueller comes back and says we didn't find any evidence of collusion. What are the Democrats going to do then, Juan? They've convinced themselves for a year and a half there's collusion. And then when there's a fact-finding mission and they have no evidence, what will the Democrats going to do then? And just another side point, Justice Breyer was popped, arrested when he was at Stanford for underage drinking. No one made any stink about that at all. Total double standard. WILLIAMS: Oh, I see. And he denied it and said he was a choir boy and a virgin? WATTERS: Nope. He was popped for underage drinking and no one called him a raging alcoholic. WILLIAMS: I get it. So the temperament question, Dana, is large for the Democrats. They say, you know, Thursday when Kavanaugh was testifying, he's talking about Clinton conspiracy theories like he's a right-wing radio talk show host, not a Supreme Court nominee. PERINO: Conservative start in a hole when they have these conversations because they usually based things on logic and fact and not emotion. And if you show emotion, then you're either hysterical or crazy or angry or mad. I actually think if you want to talk about temperament, he testified for 31 hours that week in front -- several days in front of the committee. Remember all the protesters screaming in the background? All the different -- he never once -- the only time that he decided he had to show what he really felt -- he had to lay it all out on the line, that's not about judicial temperament. That was about his reputation. PIRRO: And everyone said to him if you respond the way you did with Martha MacCallum, our Martha MacCallum, was a great interview, you were too laid- back. I mean, he was basically told this is your moments. You better get out there and show some emotion. WILLIAMS: So, Greg, you're a man of great restraint. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: And you oftentimes play for me that very much a judicial. GUTFELD: I'm going to show you. WILLIAMS: . temperament. GUTFELD: I'm going to show you how restrained I am. Ted Kennedy let a woman die. Bill Clinton has been accused of rape and assault by a number of women. So the Democratic Party should be renamed to Bill and Ted not so excellent adventure. They've treated women like spoils for the powerful, teachers, waitresses, campaign interns were all obliged to kiss the ring, that's to John Kerry. As for Booker, I commend him for his honesty. He has -- basically said that we will ruin a man and accept the collateral damage of his family, his family's torture because the cause is bigger than any individual. And the cause, the left-wing cause is bigger than the actual system itself. We can subvert a system. He would be a great -- Cory would be a great fascist. WILLIAMS: You think he's talking about the man's credibility given there's so many inconsistency. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: He's destroyed it. He could be a great -- he would have been great in East Germany. Booker, he missed his boat. PIRRO: But you know what? I think the most -- the greatest hypocrisy is when they say, Kerry says, that they stood up and owned their moments. They only stood up and owned their moments after the statute of limitations. GUTFELD: Yeah, they stood up with their pants down. WATTERS: Didn't he wear like a fake neck brace, too, because he was the vet. Remember, he played the victim. WILLIAMS: I see. So this woman standing out there, putting her name and her face in public, and all the. GUTFELD: Yeah, we hate her, Juan. We think she's evil. We think she's evil. WILLIAMS: Go tribalism. Greg's monologue, yeah, and it's a good one on how a mob mentality has taken over college campuses, that's next. Have some fun. Watch The Five. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: So clapping has been banned at Britain's University of Manchester student union. Clapping because it triggers anxiety and discourages people from attending events, and it will be replaced with a silent version of jazz hands which is said to encourage an environment of respect. Meanwhile, totally different story, a Massachusetts professor said that the label \"veteran\" should be expanded to include peace activists. I say the label \"professor\" should be expanded to include messy droolers. The one thing these things have in common besides lunacy is that they've both broken out of the asylum gates of a local university. The seed pods from the garden of stupid are now blooming in the real world. Why is that? Because no one wants to say: Man, that's really dumb. We're all bullied to silence now by the tyranny of grievance. Nobody wants to share the risk in calling out absurdity because that makes you a big meanie. Example: You're on a subway and a maniac gets on board, he's a babbling idiot, so everyone, what do they do? They look down at their phones. Why? Because no one wants to assume a piece of the risk, so they hide from the maniac. Then you realized the maniac is Bill de Blasio. Again, he's screaming inanities. Your head aches, he won't shut up. So now the joke's on you: You should have complained the moment de Blasio got on. You should have said shut up and get out of here, you're too loud and stupid for mass transit. Ideological excess spread when everyone looks the other way, whether it's on campus, in Congress, in media. But maybe for once, it's time, let's share the risk. It might be the only defense we have left. So, Jesse, they also said that clapping makes people with autism nervous, and I think that was a strategy to use a real issue to camouflage a silly idea because if clapping makes autistic or any anxious people nervous, it would be harmful to keep them from becoming accustomed to it. Like, what if they want to go to a soccer game, or what if they want to go to a rock concert. They can't because they wouldn't be used to clapping. This is absurd. WATTERS: Are you sure this isn't an onion article? Do you double check? GUTFELD: I double checked. WATTERS: I think we're getting spook here. GUTFELD: I better check with the producers. WATTERS: All right, we'll check after. Here's what I think, clapping isn't really for the people that are clapping. It's for the person that's performing, for instance, myself. Like, when I'm on stage, right, I need the clapping to know if my jokes are landing. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: . to know if I have the audience on my side or not. I need that affirmation. They're missing that point. Also. GUTFELD: It's all about Jesse. WATTERS: The British are also overlooking something else, home team advantage. When you have a really loud crowd that forces the opposing team into taking timeouts, and they miscommunicate, and they're also missing that. Also, to your point about autism, this discriminates against blind people. Blind people can't see jazz hands, OK? Very discriminatory. And getting to the auditory situation, there were some loud noises around World War II when the Germans were dropping really loud bombs. GUTFELD: Yeah. WATTERS: . on the British, and I think the British generation -- I think they survived. The anxiety there, that's real anxiety and they made it out OK. GUTFELD: Yeah. Juan, what do you make of the idea of peace activists being called veterans? WILLIAMS: I think that's a great idea because I think diplomats -- they're really talking about -- I mean, you saw a peace activists like some kid marching in protest. They're not -- they're talking about people who have been diplomats, negotiators, people who made an effort, even people who've gone overseas like with the peace corps, the Mormons. GUTFELD: That's not a military veteran. WILLIAMS: No, I didn't say -- you've said military. They didn't say military, they said veterans. These are people who have given up themselves. GUTFELD: So I'm a TV veteran. (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: I mean, when you think about it, they gave it themselves. They did a job, they've got paid for it. When you put your life on the line, you carry a weapon, that's a veteran. That's someone -- WILLIAMS: Our soldiers get paid for it. PIRRO: Yes, they get paid for it, but you know what? GUTFELD: Not enough. PIRRO: The risk to them, if you do the classic risk-reward. This isn't a good idea to be in this line of work. The chances are someone is out there looking to kill you. WILLIAMS: I don't think -- I don't think it's a great risk to go and put yourself on the line in the Peace Corps, let me tell you. WATTERS: But Juan, when you put a bullet in bin Laden's head, you're a peace activist, because now bin Laden can't make war. GUTFELD: There you go! There you go -- WILLIAMS: You know what, Jesse? You're a veteran. WATTERS: Yes. GUTFELD: You know, Dana, I do feel that the big problem these days is that nobody wants to share the risk. When there's -- when, like, there's a really dumb idea, there's a minority of activists that are so loud that they'll boycott you. They'll come after you. They'll hound you. So people just go, that's a good idea. Nobody wants to share the risk. PERINO: Or -- well, as you were saying that, it does -- all of us for so long, when we hear these kinds of things, like, \"Oh, that's stupid.\" GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: \"That's ridiculous.\" And then -- but you know, all of a sudden, now there's an entire generation of people -- GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: -- who think that you can't function in the real world without all of this mollycoddling. GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. WATTERS: Mollycoddling? GUTFELD: I love that word. PERINO: It's a British word. GUTFELD: It's like, you know, the speech codes on campus is a lousy idea. But academia, they -- they didn't want to share the risk. They didn't want people banging on their doors. PERINO: Remember the president of the -- of that university in Oklahoma -- GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: -- who stood up and he said, like, \"We are not your babysitters. We're not your parents. We're here to challenge your thinking.\" And remember, he got all that attention but a lot of -- more people should be like that. GUTFELD: More people should be willing to take a risk. You know, Manchester United, by the way, has the loudest soccer fans. I don't know if -- WATTERS: They're not doing jazz hands. GUTFELD: They're not doing jazz hands. WILLIAMS: You know what? Have you ever been to Gallaudet? GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: And I tell you what: They do lots of things. By the way, they are very aggressive players, because they don't hear the whistles. So they keep going. But I will say this: jazz hands work. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: Juan is pro-jazz hands. WILLIAMS: I don't have any problem with it. GUTFELD: All right. Hollywood liberals heading to Washington in an attempt to take down Kavanaugh. Will this just rally the Republican base even more? That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PIRRO: Some Hollywood liberals recently teamed up with progressive group MoveOn.org to make a video attacking Brett Kavanaugh. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dear Professor Ford -- JULIANNE MOORE, ACTRESS: -- we know how difficult it is to stand up to powerful people. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We want to thank you for publicly sharing your story of sexual violence. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The behavior you described was wrong. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wrong. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wrong and runs directly counter to upholding the law -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- and promoting justice. MOORE: He should not be confirmed. AMERICA FERRERA, ACTRESS: He should not be confirmed. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He should not be confirmed. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: And they're not stopping there. Tomorrow in Washington, anti-Trump celebrities, including John Legend, Lena Dunham, Alicia Keys, and Whoopi Goldberg, are set to protest against the president's Supreme Court nominee. The star-studded hate-fest is taking place in front of the D.C. Circuit courthouse, where the judge has served for more than 12 years. All right, things are hot. I want to start with you, Juan. OK, first of all -- WILLIAMS: Wait, why do we now break with tradition? PIRRO: I want to start with you first. WILLIAMS: OK. PIRRO: All right. Did any of these celebrities work for Hillary Clinton? WILLIAMS: I guess like -- I think most of them supported Hillary. PIRRO: Yes, but it didn't work for Hillary, did it? WILLIAMS: Oh, it didn't work? They would come out. No, in fact -- PIRRO: So is it going to work for Kavanaugh? WILLIAMS: -- if you watched \"The Five,\" you would know that what happens here is we say \"that Hollywood elite,\" you know, play to the whole notion of conservative grievance with these elites that are taking control. and \"We don't want to hear from them. Why don't they just entertain us us?\" Just go right ahead. PERINO: We're brilliant. PIRRO: You are brilliant. And that's why I'll go to next, Dana. PERINO: OK, thanks. PIRRO: Who do you think is going to be more charged up? Where is the voter enthusiasm? PERINO: If Hollywood -- Hollywood thinks they're going to help, they better hurry. Because just today there was a new poll that came out this afternoon that said that the Democratic -- the Democrats' edge in the generic ballot has evaporated in the last two weeks. So that should tell them something that they should be aware of. Because do you want to increase the possible political fortunes of a Cory Booker and a Kamala Harris at the expense of the Senate seats that you are actually running for in 2018? The other thing is, I do think that Hollywood can help in one way for the Democrats. And Republicans should be really aware of this. This is my issue. It is the registering of new voters. The numbers are astounding. I'll give you two examples. In Virginia this year, 135,000 new voters. New voters are usually the ones that vote -- they'll vote 99 percent of the time that first time, and they're probably Democrats. In Texas, this number just in: 400,000 new voters since March. And that's why these numbers are hard. Like, you see the polling about Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz. That's one of the reasons that -- WILLIAMS: Can I interject there and say that the numbers also show that, given the Kavanaugh hearings and the controversy, 61 percent of Democrats say they're more likely to vote versus 52 percent of Republicans. And guess what? Forty-six, almost half of the people, say it has no impact. PIRRO: All right, Greg. Let me ask you this. Let's assume that Kavanaugh is confirmed. Does that mean that the Republican enthusiasm is lessened and that the Democrats are coming out at full charge? Or is it the opposite? GUTFELD: I'm not sure. Normally, I would say that if Kavanaugh got in, you would see a blue wave; and if Kavanaugh didn't get in, you would have a huge red wave and then get an even more conservative judge. But I think people are so angry at what they've been seeing with Kavanaugh and now he's been mistreated, and how the media has been complicit in this, that you might get Kavanaugh and you might even get a mild red wave. PIRRO: Red wave. GUTFELD: The one thing about Hollywood that is disturbing is that they were silent for decades over Harvey Weinstein. And they didn't come out until it was safe and easy for them. They waited -- they had to wait for Ronan Farrow to get that article out. And many -- let's face it. Everybody in Hollywood knew about Harvey Weinstein. I want these celebrities to keep doing it. Because what it comes off as, it comes off as the cool kids exacting peer pressure on everybody else. They're at their cafeteria table saying if you don't agree with me, you're not cool. It doesn't work with Americans, women. We just look at you and we go, \"Please.\" We don't take you seriously. WATTERS: Yes, not only did they, you know, not say anything about Harvey Weinstein. They didn't say anything about Roman Polanski. They loved up on Bill Clinton. So it's a little bit hypocritical for them. And these celebrities that are coming in and kind of bum-rushing the Capitol, this are not what you do when you want to send in someone to a swing vote or a swing district. This is Whoopi Goldberg. This is Lena Dunham. These people are really despised by half of the country. And then the independents, they're not really going to move the needle. This is not like the Million Man March. This is not like the Women's March. This isn't like the Tea Party. These are highly-trained Democratic activists that are taking off work, if they have a job, and they're going to harass public officials. And the only reason we're paying more attention to them is because they're nastier now. The other day someone went into an office of a congressman and assaulted them. And that's barely been reported. That's why it's gotten out of control. PIRRO: How do you think it sells when Whoopi Goldberg says, \"Donald Trump is not my president, and he take a huge dump on the country\"? I mean, ordinary people, unless you're a partisan -- and let's admit, partisans all already entrenched. They know how they're going to vote. Nothing matters to them. But does that -- is that a way to sway people, to say, \"He's not my president. He takes a dump on us\"? WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, we had discussions here at this table, Judge, about how Donald Trump talks, and how abusive his language can be to people. So she -- now that she does it, you want to condemn her. PIRRO: No, no, I've got my own issues. I was on \"The View\" when my book came out. That's another issue. But to say, \"He's not my president,\" does that mean that you want no part of this country or that you don't believe in the electoral process? Or what is -- I mean, what is the point of that? WILLIAMS: Well, to my mind, what she's saying is she thinks this guy is not behaving in a presidential manner. And he's acting in a way that's damaging and divisive to the country. The whole -- Jesse a minute ago was talking about Roman Polanski and Dem -- liberals, I guess, more than Democrats -- excusing bad, even illegal sexual behavior. But Jesse, why wouldn't you say -- WATTERS: Yes. WILLIAMS: -- that was wrong, and it would be wrong to do something -- WATTERS: I would say she's saying things for cheap laughter and claps on \"The View,\" and I can do that, too, on \"The Five.\" I can throw out red meat all day and get claps. And not jazz hands. PIRRO: OK, not now, because I'm going to a tease. Don't go anywhere. \"Wild Card Wednesday\" is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: I love that song. All right. It's time now for our brand-new edition of \"Wild Card Wednesday.\" Judge Jeanine doesn't know what we're doing here. PIRRO: Yes. PERINO: So we're just going to go with the flow. She's going to have to go with the flow. OK, we each picked out a topic. We put them in the hat. We don't know which -- the stories that each of us chose, unless somebody cheated. I don't think anybody did, because we're all very good people here. OK. New study finds that more than 250 people -- 250 people worldwide have died taking selfies. WATTERS: Darwinism. PERINO: Yes. OK, this was mine. They have died taking selfies in front of oncoming trains, falling from heights, and encountering wild animals. What do we think about that, Jesse? WATTERS: Wow. Like I said, Darwinism at its finest. GUTFELD: I would expect more, because so many people are doing it. And because they only take the selfies in, like, dangerous areas. PERINO: Exactly. GUTFELD: Like on a mountain and stuff. And then they just -- PIRRO: Do you see that on your cell phone? Sometimes you'll be reading an article, and then they'll have sponsored stories and it will have a picture of a woman with a snake around her neck and say, \"Don't hit this unless you want to see what happened to her.\" I never hit. I don't want to see. GUTFELD: I never hit it. WATTERS: I hit it every time. WILLIAMS: I thought your answer was great, Darwinism. Because to me it's an extension of, like, people walking down the street or crossing the street and they are looking at the cell phone. You think, wait a second. But look at this guy here off the edge of a skyscraper, off the edge of a cliff. PERINO: Not cool. WILLIAMS: That's just plain stupid. PIRRO: Stupid. PERINO: Don't do that, guys. Don't do that. All right. Not worth it. Just Photoshop yourself in. GUTFELD: Yes, cheat, lie. That's what Dana says. PERINO: All right. Oh, I'm sure Greg picked this one. Your dog is probably dumber than you think. WATTERS: You did, didn't you? PERINO: A new study finds that dogs are not a smart or special as we've been led to believe. And thinking a dog is exceptionally smart just isn't true. While they may have their own unique traits, dogs have the same intelligence level as pigeons? What? PIRRO: OK. I picked that one, too. Greg, I picked that one. GUTFELD: This is the best story. When I saw this, I go, \"Wild Card Wednesday.\" I don't want to say anything. I just want to hear you people talk about this. PIRRO: OK, I picked this one, so I want to talk about it. My dogs are brilliant. GUTFELD: Yes, of course. PIRRO: No. 2 on the list. PERINO: Horses are brilliant too. PIRRO: Horses are? Forget horses. My dog -- there's my dog! WATTERS: I had a feeling Jasper wasn't very smart. PIRRO: Now wait a minute. That's not right. Jasper likes to fish. What's not smart about that? GUTFELD: They've never invented a single thing. Dogs, animals. PERINO: What about pigeons? GUTFELD: Pigeons. What have they invented? PERINO: Nothing. That's what I'm saying. WATTERS: Pigs are really smart. Did you hear that? Pigs are one of the smartest. GUTFELD: The judge had two pigs. WATTERS: There you go. PIRRO: For 18 years. And I wanted them to be drug pigs. I bought drug dogs for the police department. I wanted to get my pigs to be drug pigs. WATTERS: Find drugs with the pigs? PERINO: Juan, what do you think? Anything quick? WILLIAMS: No. PERINO: OK. GUTFELD: You're too scared to talk about the dogs. WILLIAMS: A drug pig. PERINO: Somebody chose this one, that we had a test today for across the U.S. to receive a presidential alert. It's in case of an emergency. National Wireless Emergency Alert System. You might have gotten it on your phone. It goes, \"Beep, beep, beep.\" Just a test. It was just a test. WILLIAMS: So that was mine, because -- PIRRO: I'm trying get a reading here, Juan. WILLIAMS: -- that's unbelievable. Usually these things go off, and it's an Amber Alert or now they have Silver Alerts for the elderly. PERINO: Elderly, yes. WILLIAMS: But it's controlled by the state and local governments. So this is the first time you have the national government, the president now controls going out, sending it. And everybody gets it. It's dangerous on one level. Because you think, hey, suddenly -- GUTFELD: I was going to say it's like -- PERINO: You could be taking a selfie, you know, and then that thing -- PERINO: It would bad if it was hacked. FiveFanPhotoshop did one of Jasper hacking in, sending a picture. GUTFELD: Of course. We did the dog thing already. PERINO: Guess what? Somebody else chose a stupid dog story. Your dog is probably dumber than you think. You? WATTERS: I chose the text alert. WILLIAMS: There you go. GUTFELD: Then who chose -- PERINO: Who chose the dog thing again? WILLIAMS: Not me. Oh, you. PIRRO: I said I did. GUTFELD: Oh, I did, too. PIRRO: I said it. Nobody listened to me. PERINO: No, nobody did. I didn't think that -- PIRRO: I said I did it. PERINO: I'm sorry. I thought that Greg did it to make fun of me. You did the alert? WATTERS: Yes, I did the alert. PERINO: Why? WATTERS: Because I thought it worked better than the Obamacare website. GUTFELD: Good point. PERINO: OK. The last one is this -- it's the same one. Presidential alert. Like, why would the producers do that? We have to have different things. PIRRO: Yes, producers. WATTERS: You know, I think the producers do a really nice job. PIRRO: I do not like this a lot. PERINO: Let's have a round of applause for the producers. Round of applause, round of applause. WATTERS: The producers. Jazz hands, everybody. Jazz hands. PERINO: All right, \"One More Thing\" is up next. PIRRO: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for \"One More Thing\" -- Dana. PERINO: Well, we all love this song. Listen. (MUSIC: BUDDY HOLLY'S \"PEGGY SUE\") PERINO: So pretty much everybody knows that song. Peggy Sue Gerron Rackham, she was a real person, and there she is pictured there. She was the one who inspired one of Buddy Holiday's [SIC] big -- excuse me, Buddy Holly's biggest hits. She just passed away. She was 78 years old. She was -- the song was originally going to be called \"Cindy Lou,\" named for Buddy's niece, but his drummer convinced him to change the name so he could impress Peggy. That's very romantic. PIRRO: Yes, but did he ever end up with Peggy? GUTFELD: No, he died in a plane crash. WILLIAMS: That's Buddy Holly. Did the drummer die, too? GUTFELD: Well, that's -- PIRRO: What? GUTFELD: Wait. WILLIAMS: Buddy Holly died. PERINO: He died. I don't know about the drummer. But anyway, she -- she passed away. GUTFELD: The Big Bopper died. The Big Bopper died, yes. \"Chantilly Lace, got a pretty face.\" PIRRO: Yes, he didn't like Peggy Sue. WATTERS: Oh, wow. That's good, Greg. GUTFELD: Thank you. WILLIAMS: By the way, she did get married to the drummer. PERINO: She did? PIRRO: She did? WILLIAMS: yes. PIRRO: How do you know this? WILLIAMS: I read it. WATTERS: All right. GUTFELD: Juan reads the packet. PERINO: Well, I didn't actually -- WATTERS: Juan reads. PERINO: Yes. WATTERS: Not the missile report (ph). Go ahead, Juan. WILLIAMS: All right. So you know they say it's your birthday, to quote the Beatles, but what if you're a homeless child? A Pittsburgh woman doing volunteer work with the homeless began to cry when Beverly, an 11-year-old, told her she'd never had a birthday party or a slice of birthday cake. So Megs Yunn, a 33-year-old mom of four, came up with this idea. She calls it Beverly's Birthdays. And since 2012 she's put on parties for more than 30,000 children in Pittsburgh, allowing them to feel like they matter for a few hours and forget the stress of living in poverty. By the way, an estimated 2.5 million homeless kids live in the United States, and for them, Yunn's idea just terrific. It's the gift that keeps on giving, because it's a great example for us all. WATTERS: Very nice. All right. Dustin Grasso is a trainer of mine. His son Dominic was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes. And he's got this crew, Dominic's Dominators, and there's going to be a big annual one walk, big walk, big run in the Long Island area at Hecksher State Park, Saturday October 21. And if you want to just send them some money to raise awareness and to help find a cure for juvenile diabetes, go there and check that out. And also, \"Wednesdays with Watters,\" Martha MacCallum tonight, 7 p.m. GUTFELD: What will you be talking about? WATTERS: We will probably be talking about jazz hands, Greg. GUTFELD: Fantastic. Fantastic. PERINO: I hope she claps for you. WATTERS: She will. I need that affirmation. GUTFELD: So if you go to FOX News -- what is it, FOXNewsPodcast.com or podcast -- PERINO: I think it's FOX News.com/podcast. WATTERS: Podcasts. It's podcasts. GUTFELD: I have a -- FOXNewsPodcasts. I have a great long interview with Tucker Carlson. We talk about his new book. But mostly, we just talk about all sorts of stuff, and I mean, it's pretty brutal -- PERINO: It's a great conversation. GUTFELD: -- pretty brutal stuff in there about his life. WATTERS: You really took it to him, didn't you? GUTFELD: We took one caller. My wife called in. Called in. She didn't know I was doing a podcast at the time, so she ended up in the actual podcast. WATTERS: Wow, that's a podcast I may actually check out. GUTFELD: Yes. And by the way, I talked about a lot of people. I didn't talk about you, though, Jesse. WATTERS: Now I'm not going to listen. GUTFELD: Exactly. WATTERS: Jeanine. PIRRO: OK, so I spent 30 years -- 32 years, to be exact, in law enforcement. And I saw a video, and it is -- it is all about poetic justice. I want you to watch it. Now you see what that guy is doing? He is a burglar. GUTFELD: Right. PIRRO: He is trying to get into a restaurant. He's throwing a brick at it. WATTERS: The brick came back and hit him in the head? PIRRO: The brick comes back and hits him in the head. So this is, for any prosecutor, the most valuable piece of evidence you can have. You can just turn on the light and say to the jury, \"Please deliberate. You heard my opening and my closing. Here's the video.\" So here's the deal. GUTFELD: Looks like an ice cube. PIRRO: This is a surveillance video, and this guy tried three times to get into the restaurant, which apparently has a kind of bulletproof glass that even a brick won't go through. So the crushing blow, as you can see, sends him to the ground. Then he was unconscious for a few minutes. Now, police say he tried it three times, and all three attempts were obviously unsuccessful, prompting the guy, after he passed out, to get up and leave. So my question is, you know, did they arrest him? Did they indict him? Has he been convicted? GUTFELD: They're going to throw the brick at him. PIRRO: Throw the brick at him, that is so good. WILLIAMS: Maybe he -- he could pitch -- WATTERS: All right. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" \"Special Report\" is up next. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS: All right.

            "article_content": "FBN\u2019s Gerri Willis reports Medicare funds will run out in 11 years and Social Security has only 17 years until insolvency. WASHINGTON -- Medicare's financial problems have gotten worse, and Social Security's can't be ignored forever, the government said Tuesday in an annual assessment that amounts to a sobering checkup on programs vital to the middle class. The report from program trustees says Medicare will become insolvent in 2026 -- three years earlier than previously forecast. Its giant trust fund for inpatient care won't be able to cover projected medical bills starting at that point. The report says Social Security will become insolvent in 2034 -- no change from the projection last year. The warning serves as a reminder of major issues left to languish while Washington plunges deeper into partisan strife. More than 62 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and surviving children receive Social Security benefits. The average monthly payment is $1,294 for all beneficiaries. Medicare provides health insurance for about 60 million people, most of whom are age 65 or older. Together the two programs have been credited with dramatically reducing poverty among older people and extending life expectancy for Americans. Financed with payroll taxes collected from workers and employers, Social Security and Medicare account for about 40 percent of government spending, excluding interest on the federal debt. Unless lawmakers act, both programs face the future prospect of being unable to cover the full cost of promised benefits. With Social Security that could mean sharply reduced payments for some retirees, many of whom are already on tight budgets. For Medicare, it could mean that hospitals, nursing homes and other providers of medical care would be paid only part of their agreed-upon fees. Medicare's problems are widely seen as more difficult to solve. It's not just the growing number of beneficiaries with the baby boom generation moving into retirement. It's also the unpredictability of health care costs, which can be jolted by high-priced breakthrough cures, and which regularly outpace the overall rate of economic growth. President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise that he wouldn't cut Social Security or Medicare, but he hasn't offered a rescue plan for either program. Democrats, meanwhile, want to extend the social safety net by spending more on health care and education. But government deficits keep rising, and the recent Republican tax-cut bill is only expected to add to the debt. That leaves less maneuvering room for policymakers when the day of reckoning finally arrives for Social Security and Medicare. In principle, the U.S. is supposed to be paying forward its Social Security and Medicare obligations by building up trust funds to cover future costs. That money is invested in special government securities, which also collect interest. But when the money is actually needed to pay for benefits, economists say a government deep in debt could be hard pressed to make good. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has long been an advocate for overhauling the programs, introducing a voucher-like system for Medicare and calling for partially privatizing Social Security. But now that Ryan is leaving Congress, it's unclear who will take up the mantle for budget hawks. In any case, Republicans may have damaged their credibility on budget issues by voting to increase government spending and cut taxes. Many Democrats don't see a need for immediate action. Their formula is likely to involve tax increases to help keep the programs solvent.",

Five hours from now, the president of the United States sits down with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, the first U.S. president to do so with a North Korean leader. And the stakes obviously couldn't be higher. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. Well, leading up to those talks, Kim Jong-un out and about visiting a Sands casino resort in Singapore. The guy, remember, doesn't get out that much. The North Korean also stopping to pose for a selfie. Former basketball star Dennis Rodman arriving on the scene, saying that he wants to cheer on both sides. And stocks, which were all over the map, ended up nominally to the upside today. But what is remarkable is, through trade wars and tiffs and alienating comments back and forth between ourselves and the Canadians, they have been up and continue to go up. So what do they see that maybe some worried pundits do not? Let's get the read from John Roberts in Singapore, at least for this summit. What happens next? Hey, John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Neil, good job morning to you from Singapore.And the latest that we're learning is, the reason why President Trump has moved up his departure to 7:00 p.m. tonight from tomorrow morning here in Singapore is that Kim Jong-un's people told the United States' delegation that said he was going to be leaving this afternoon.The president had reserved Wednesday morning for additional talks, if it was necessary. So, the president decided, well, if Kim's leaving, there is no reason for me to hang around. So he's scheduled to go out at 7:00 tonight, after a 4:00 p.m. press conference, which will be 4:00 in the morning, 12 hours from now New York time. So if you want to hear what the president has to say, set your alarm clocks, because that's when he will be speaking. The president with a lot to offer Kim Jong-un in their very first historic bilateral meeting today between the United States president and a North Korean leader. He's got to economic guarantees for Kim on the table. He's got security guarantees, a potential end to the Korean War, after it's just been under an armistice for all of these decades, and the potential for the normalization of relations between the United States and North Korea, if -- and this is a big if -- North Korea and Kim Jong-un are willing to give up their nuclear program.The president also changing up the paradigm here. This is not going to be incrementalism, as we have seen in the past, where the United States trades some economic benefits for something to curb North Korea's nuclear program. The president wants complete and irreversible and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. What's really interesting is that the first meeting today is going to be simply between President Trump and Kim Jong-un one on one with only their translators present, unlike this big luncheon, bilateral meeting that you see here with Singapore's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. And there's the president together with Prime Minister Lee. Kellyanne Conway telling us this morning that that's the way the president likes to do things, mano a mano. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: President Trump made very clear he would like to meet one on one with just the translators with the other principal here. And that's very much the way this president has been doing business successfully throughout his career. And it is anything -- it may see -- it may strike many people who have been involved in the past as an unusual request. But, remember, we're looking at an entirely different framing. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: And Kim Jong-un taking in the sights of Singapore last night. One of the places he visited, as you mentioned at the very top of this, Neil, was the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino. There you see Kim walking around. Really is extraordinary. This is the farthest that he's ever been outside of Pyongyang as the leader of North Korea. That Marina Bay Sands, the iconic structure now on the Singapore skyline, that there's three high-rise towers of hotel rooms, and then something spread across the top of it that looks like a cargo ship that somehow landed up there, it's owned, by the way, by Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate and a big supporter of President Trump. So, Neil, perhaps Kim Jong-un getting a look there at what might be possible to get some new economic incentives from the United States in exchange for denuclearization. I should say one thing about the departure, though, Neil. While the president is set to go tonight at 7:00, we're told that the departure is still fluid. Probably no reason to delay it, but you never know. They're  holding open just in case -- Neil. CAVUTO: Very interesting. John Roberts, thank you very much. I know you have a long day ahead of you, night, whatever. Claudia Rosett, a foreign policy fellow at the Independent Women's Forum, has long warned, don't get too excited here, not that she's trying to be a wet blanket. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: But she knows the North Korea leader well, knows his father and grandfather well, and some past history on North Korea very, very well. So, you say we should go into this with eyes wide open. What do you mean? CLAUDIA ROSETT, FOREIGN POLICY FELLOW, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Oh, yes. I mean, be incredibly wary. The fact that Kim enjoys strolling around Singapore at night doesn't mean that he's about to give up his nuclear program. And it does not change the character of the most brutally, bloody-minded, repressive, totalitarian state on the planet, which is what he runs. CAVUTO: Claudia, the argument has always been, we don't pick and choose the leaders of other countries with whom we negotiate. If that were the case, FDR certainly would have found an alternative to Joseph Stalin. But Stalin was the only guy we had representing the then Soviet Union. And this is the only guy we have representing North Korea. What do you make of that? ROSETT: Yes. Well, the problem with the analogy there is that Stalin was also fighting the Nazis. CAVUTO: Very good point. ROSETT: And Kim Jong-un isn't actually fighting anybody. And, of course, once Stalin got done fighting the Nazis, he installed Kim Jong-un's grandfather in North Korea. So, out of that came the Cold War and our current problem. So it's true. You don't know -- you can't always -- you can't pick who you negotiate with or who you confront. But you can be keenly aware that everything points to Kim will want any benefits, but he's probably going to look for any way he can find to not deliver this denuclearization, whatever that actually means, basically to not give up his nuclear program. And, remember, he also has biological, chemical weapons, and the conventional weapons that have held Seoul hostage since the Korean War. So, that's the real scene. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: I'm sorry, Claudia. But we must know the history on this, right? ROSETT: Right. CAVUTO: That other administrations... ROSETT: Yes. CAVUTO: ... also entering talks with the best of intentions and the highest of hopes, were hoodwinked. So this is a little different here, that the actual leaders of the country are meeting. ROSETT: Yes. CAVUTO: So that changes the complexion a bit. But how do you avoid the North Korean history of just lying? I mean, how do you verify what they are doing, when in fact, in some cases, they can drag it out for years looking like they're following an agreement, as they did during the Clinton administration, and yet rip it up as soon as that administration goes? ROSETT: Neil, we have to offer a seriously credible threat. That's why I am encouraged actually that President Trump wants this one-on- one meeting, where if I were North Korea's translator, I would be worried that I was going to be killed on the way out of Singapore, because these will be the witnesses. But that's a chance for President Trump to say to Kim Jong-un, here are -- just in case Kim Jong-un has been misinformed by the lackeys and acolytes who surround him about the real nature of American military might, capability, and so on, look, we do have the ability to obliterate you. And Trump needs some credible way to really make that threat. Now, I don't know if he will. But that's what might persuade Kim to do something. And the problem is, what needs to happen for anything to be credible, for any complete, verifiable, irreversible, in the phrase of the day, right, is the end of that regime, a change in character so profound that it's effectively gone, that Kim presides as some titular head of a very different regime, which I think would bring his downfall, or that we simply get rid of them. It's -- unfortunately, Neil, that's where all my calculations end up, is, this regime has to go. And when that happens, we can talk about seriously decreasing the danger that is North Korea. But as long as Kim Jong-un has this power that he inherited and has greatly amplified by such things as assassinating his brother -- half-brother with V.X. nerve agent, executing his uncle, people who had ideas about liberalizing North Korea, by the way, he has had murdered, it really isn't going to change. We are likely to see more tinsel and promises and kicking the can down the road. So that that's the bottom line, Neil. The regime, one way or another, has to go. What I would -- in my dreams, President Trump would say to Kim in this private session, there's one security guarantee we can offer you, and that is the Marcos residence on Hawaii, where he lived out his life in exile after he left the Philippines, because if -- I don't think, while the regime remains in place, we can pry away its nuclear program. CAVUTO: Wow. ROSETT: I think, in the end, the regime has to go first. CAVUTO: OK. ROSETT: And then you get rid of it. CAVUTO: Don't hold your breath on that. We shall see what happens. ROSETT: No. But -- yes. CAVUTO: Claudia, thank you very, very much. ROSETT: You're welcome. CAVUTO: I think. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: Let's get the read on just that from Oklahoma Republican Senator James Lankford. He is a member of the Intel Committee, among others. Senator, what do you think of that, that, in the end, this really comes down to recognizing we can't trust this -- this guy and the people around him, and that, ultimately, the only way to assure cooperation down the road is that he not be there? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD, R\u2014OKLAHOMA: He has been the brutal dictator. And the people around him have answered yes to every single statement that he has made, because, if they don't, he has been executed publicly. And he is not afraid to be able to take military leaders, put them on a post, and kill them with an anti-aircraft gun for a public execution. So, he has been a ruthless dictator, despite all the pictures of him smiling and walking through the streets in Singapore. And we should be keenly aware of that as we're negotiating with him. Now, if he wants his people, and he has any compassion for the people and the millions of folks that live in squalor and poverty in North Korea, he will set aside his nuclear weapons, and so they have the opportunity to be able to have electricity and food and the opportunities that the rest of the world around them has. CAVUTO: Do you really think he cares, though? LANKFORD: Well, we're about to find out. CAVUTO: Yes, I guess you're right. LANKFORD: That's the big issue is, if he comes to agreement and comes to and says, I will set aside all these nuclear weapons, the United States is very willing to be able to lean in to provide economic engagement. We're not going to just pour millions of dollars on them. But if they open up their economy and they are able to set aside nuclear weapons, they could be as prosperous as South Korea is. It was a great example of what communism and free markets look like when you look at North Korea and South Korea, a very, very prosperous South Korea, and the North Koreans that live in squalor and poverty. CAVUTO: It is kind of weird, for whatever reasons, though, Senator, that we have a situation where we're alienating or talking nasty about our friends, like the Canadians and the Germans and then all those in the G7, maybe for perfectly valid reasons -- they would argue otherwise -- and we're cozying up to this guy. LANKFORD: Well, I would hope the presence not cozying up to this guy. We have very strong sanctions on him. We're watching out for their illegal transportation of any kind of goods leaving out still. We're still working diplomatically around the world to be able to isolate North Korea. So, our sanctions in place. We're continuing to apply pressure. But it's entirely reasonable to say, we're not applying pressure so we never talk. We're applying pressure to force us all to the table, so we actually talk and get to an agreement. So, if you're going to apply strict sanctions, the reason for those sanctions is to get to the table that they're headed to in about 12 hours from now, and so they can get to that table, get a resolution, come out of it out with a first step. And I have no optimism that everything gets resolved today. But I do have some optimism that they can at least lay the groundwork for the next meeting. And, usually, the next meeting is when you start getting some things actually resolved. CAVUTO: The fact that they're talking, to your point, is something in and of itself. And, as I was raising with the prior guest, we can't pick and choose the leaders of the country with whom we meet. And the hope is, at least from this administration talking to the other administration, North Korea, is that they will change their ways. Their history is that they don't, that they lie and they cheat and they find ways around things, sometimes waiting years to not live up to those accords.You talk about the Ronald Reagan approach, trust but verify, but even when we were trying to verify, they were changing the rules midstream. So how do we avoid that this go-around? LANKFORD: Well, you keep strict sanctions on. You do what the Trump administration is doing wisely in that. And that is, keep the sanctions going, keep the pressure on them. And when things change, not with words, but with behavior, then we begin to back off and to begin to loosen that up. But you have got to have a clear set of guidelines of what we're looking for. CAVUTO: But in the past, they did change with behavior, Senator. You know what I mean? LANKFORD: Well... CAVUTO: So, you could be hoodwinked into thinking, oh, well, they are doing what we said. LANKFORD: Typically, in the past, the North Koreans would say, we will test a nuclear weapon -- weapon, we will test a missile if the rest of the world doesn't give us food, aid and money. And so we would give them money. They would not do a nuclear test. They would not test a missile for four, five, six seven years. CAVUTO: Right. LANKFORD: And then they would do it again, and we would go through cycle after cycle. If this -- if this challenge is, no, we're going to talk about actually dismantling your facilities, burying other things, setting aside the potential to have that, having clear inspections, then you let off sanctions, that is very different. CAVUTO: All right, sir, thank you very, very much. Very good seeing you. LANKFORD: You bet. Good to see you as well. CAVUTO: All right. This a big deal, as you might imagine here, and one that the global markets are pretty fixated on themselves. We're going to have live, complete coverage of this all night long, beginning at 7:00 prime minister with my colleague Lou Dobbs. At 9:00 p.m., when the talks formally begin, we will continue on FOX Business. And will be on all night, because this matters. This is something the global markets, as I say, will be watching closely. So we will get the real-time read from them, particularly the Asian markets, as this is going on, and then later on trading in futures. We will get a view of the oil markets. We will get a view of people who are putting money on this, what they make of this. You can catch one or the other. Rarely, in a format like this, can you catch them both. We will provide you both on FOX Business, and only FOX Business. We will have more to this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, what to make a trade tiff now that has escalated with our friends, particularly Canada? Because the markets aren't worried. And the fact that we are now at the lowest point we have ever been all with those friends, including Canada, including European Union, including the Germans, who are worried, even the Italians, who are concerned, where is all of this going? Market watcher Gary Kaltbaum. Gary, you would think, looking at the markets, even with a nominal uptick today, but it had been a lot stronger earlier today, but the markets have appreciated through all of this angst and hand-wringing here, even with this blow-up at the Canadians? What do you make of that? GARY KALTBAUM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think we're just in a war words right now. And I don't think a war of words is really going to kill a market at this point in time. And the market does have a lot going for it. We have talked about it, earnings, a tone a buy-backs. And we still have the ridiculously low interest rates. And the best way to explain that, Neil, is, we're at 3.8 percent unemployment. The last time we were there, we had 6 percent Fed funds rate. We're now at one 1.7 percent. So the easy money definitely helps the market also. So I think markets in good stead, and right now fortunately ignoring all this. CAVUTO: What I found remarkable. It's one thing when the president tweets-- and they were getting escalated back and forth with the Canadian prime minister -- but it's when Peter Navarro started talking and framed it in a totally different way.I want you to react to this, Peter Navarro, the president's trade spokesman, talking, more to the point, about the leader of Canada. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: There's a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad-faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump, and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door. And that's what bad-faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: Gary, I'm not -- you know, I don't know what it was that ticked the president offer or what got Peter Navarro's attention here. But as far as I -- and as long as I have covered the Canadian prime minister, he was fairly consistent in his anger over the tariffs. He expressed it a little bit differently, but he has pretty much consistently said he was concerned before the summit, during the summit, after the summit. So what's going on here? KALTBAUM: Neil, I think he may have had some bad coffee. I'm just a logical guy. And I don't understand. Rhetoric like that is reserved for Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. I don't know why they would do that. And if you're trying to move the needle in negotiations, that the last thing I want to do, because that's all that's being talked about right now. Let's hope cooler heads prevail once North Korea is done, and we get back to doing all the -- all the trade talk, and we get in a better place. And I got to tell you, Canada, we have a trade surplus with, including services. So I don't know why they would attack Canada. We have it much worse with other countries. And, again, I was in the car when I heard this, and I just could not believe my ears. CAVUTO: So, it had to be for another reason. I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt here, because, obviously... KALTBAUM: Right. CAVUTO: ... the president and the prime minister are not of the same political persuasion or parties or thought. But it's not as if any of this was new or a FOX alert, where the prime minister was coming from and how annoyed and concerned he was about these tariffs coming his way and the surplus that we enjoy with his country when it comes to goods and services. So I'm missing something. I just don't know what it could be or whether it sets the table to talk tough to the North Koreans and/or the Chinese, to let them know we could do this even with our friends. KALTBAUM: Well, I'm a big believer that most things are not said by accident, so I'm pretty sure they're trying to set the table for, you better listen to what we have to tell you. You have been doing to us for years. We have been giving you $100 and only get getting back $50 for decades. And we are the new kids in town. And we're not going to be like the past. And either you listen to us or trouble lies ahead. And that is where I think this rhetoric comes from. Again, if it was me -- I always try to put myself in the position -- I'm not talking that way, but, as they have been saying, we have a different type of administration right now. CAVUTO: All right. KALTBAUM: And they're acting like the big dogs. CAVUTO: All right. We will see what happens. Thank you, my friend, Gary Kaltbaum. KALTBAUM: You got it. CAVUTO: A very, very good read of the markets. This will be quick, right? We're told just a few hours and then done. How does that stack up against other big historic summits? Let's just say much, much shorter. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: I love having historian Burt Folsom, because he can always put the rush and rat-a-tat of today in great perspective. Burt, thank you for taking the time. I was thinking of you when I was looking at the nature of this meeting, that it's really going to be hours' long. I guess they could extend it. I don't know how it will go. But hours ain't exactly days, ain't exactly Camp David couple of weeks. BURT FOLSOM, HISTORIAN: Right. CAVUTO: It isn't all -- the nearly week that John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev had back in 1961. So, what can they do? FOLSOM: Right. I'm not sure how much they can accomplish, but, in some ways, summits are better when the goals are narrow. And they are. Just between the United States in working with North Korea, we have a denuclearization goal. And then North Korea wants to get trade reestablished and the sanctions removed. So the goals are clear. Sometimes, summits have gone poorly, even though they had more time, because the goals were too complicated and the said -- the countries were at odds with each other. CAVUTO: Yes. And then they can drag on and on. I'm thinking -- I'm ping-ponging around here, so if my crew can indulge me. The Camp David accords Jimmy Carter had with the leaders of Israel and Egypt, they went on for two weeks. They were dicey throughout. They were done sort of clandestinely, because we didn't know what was happening there, just that they were always still meeting. FOLSOM: Right. CAVUTO: But they ultimately got an accord going after two weeks. But what do you make of that? And I like what -- how you framed it, that sometimes the rush war or the limited timetable might work to that advantage. Explain. FOLSOM: I think that the comparison with Trump's potential summit here is-- with the Carter and the Camp David accords in 1978 is -- 40 years ago -- is a good comparison. The goals were narrow. In other words, words Egypt and Israel, we want them to be at peace. You had Sadat and Begin there with Carter. And that was indeed accomplished. A narrow goal. They didn't -- they had a couple weeks, and they accomplished that. CAVUTO: What about the one with Richard Nixon, of course, and the king, now, of course, Beijing, the great outreach to Mao Tse-Tung. That wasn't about signing some sort of an arms deal. It was just a way, I guess, at the time to triangulate for Richard Nixon the old Soviet Union and China. FOLSOM: Yes. CAVUTO: But explain how that went. FOLSOM: Right, because Nixon wanted to at least establish an increased trade agenda with Mao. And the Soviets and the Chinese were jealous of one another. And for Nixon to reach out to China like that was to in a way embarrass the Soviet Union, make them a little bit defensive. And, of course, once Reagan began negotiating with Gorbachev some 15 years later, then the Soviet Union was really put in a hole, because Reagan was able to push against that high Soviet military budget. And the Soviets simply couldn't afford to go on with their massive weapons program. CAVUTO: In the Reykjavik situation, Burt -- maybe refresh my mind -- that that was all going nicely, until really near the final day, where Ronald Reagan discovered that the Russians had snuck in that line about the space initiative that was near and dear to him, and that the U.S. would abandon it. FOLSOM: Yes. CAVUTO: And that was like a little line on a closing statement when you try to settle on housing purchases. He upped and walked away. FOLSOM: You're right. CAVUTO: Now, how did that go after that? FOLSOM: Well, that was at Reykjavik in 1986. And Gorbachev wanted to undermine the SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, that Reagan was proposing... CAVUTO: Right. FOLSOM: ... because he knew it might be successful, and that would, in effect, outmode his whole weapons arsenal that they had invested so heavily. So, the Soviets were anxious to avoid that. And Gorbachev made that clear. Now, Reagan, in turn, was trying to push human rights violations by the Russians, to sort of put Gorbachev a little bit ill at ease. And so they went back and forth. And, ultimately, Reagan was not going to concede and eliminate the SDI initiative and therefore did not want to go forward. But they did meet again next year in Washington, the next year. CAVUTO: Right. FOLSOM: See, it was a postponement. They respected Reagan. And, therefore, Reagan was ultimately able to be very successful. They did eliminate some weapons systems. But, ultimately, it bankrupted the Soviet Union. They were not able to go forward. And Reagan was an excellent negotiator. CAVUTO: He was, and a wily figure at that. In the end, Donald Trump was saying this past weekend, Burt, that I can size up how things look within the first minute. I'm paraphrasing here. What did you make of that comment? FOLSOM: I was startled at that, because I can -- when I heard that, I thought, I can imagine Reagan thinking that about Gorbachev. And, remember, he was able to isolate Gorbachev at the first conference, the Geneva conference in 1985. CAVUTO: Right. FOLSOM: They did have some time together. And I can imagine Reagan thinking. What I can't imagine is Reagan saying that. Trump may be right. It's odd that he would say that. But, in a way, I think he's maybe trying to project to Kim that he's strong and that Kim is not going to be able to get away with any maneuvers against Donald Trump. CAVUTO: Yes. Keep them guessing, as you say, right? Keep them guessing. FOLSOM: Exactly. CAVUTO: Burt, thank you very much, my friend, for your perspective. And that find brain of yours always comes in handy as we step way, way back from this. What is the benefit of trying to make sure it's short and sweet? It would still be short, but will the results still be sweet? The read from a guy who served our country, not only on the battlefield, but in the United States Congress, after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: It's all in how they look, all in how they president themselves. The president says he can tell within the first minute how things are going to go. So does that mean he smiles, the North Korean leader smiles? Why these things matter more you know -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, so what to expect when they first sit down. Donald Trump made some news over the weekend when he said, within the first minute or so, I have a pretty good idea how things could go. Don't laugh about it. A lot of people say, in business, as in just general life, we can size up someone almost that quickly. Retired us U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, former Republican Congressman Allen West, he served in Korea, by the way. And it's very good to have you. Thank you for taking the time, sir. FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN ALLEN WEST: My pleasure, Neil. CAVUTO: What do you make of that? You're a pretty good read of folks. That you can size them up that quickly? WEST: Well, I can tell you, when I was a commanding officer, one of the things we would tell young lieutenants that were reporting in for the first time, that most of the good commanders can size you up and make an assessment of who you are by looking at you, your comportment, how your uniform looks, your haircut. And then, when you open your mouth, you either confirm or deny our initial assertions. So I think it is very important that President Trump does that. I think that he maintains the high ground and maintains a position of -- I want to say dominance, really, when you think about it. And I listened to your previous guest. I think it's important that we keep this meeting short, because the longer it goes on, it makes it seem like Kim Jong-un has a moral victory, has a propaganda victory. It's very simple. We lay down the markers. This is what has to happen. And then you allow the respective staffs from North Korea and the United States to continue on with this process. CAVUTO: You talk about a victory for the other side, I guess, for the North Korea leader here. But I understand like keep it to time. But a few hours is really tight, unless, as to your point -- I know we chatted before about this -- they have done a lot of legwork and sort of the groundwork for this in advance. WEST: Well, if anyone thinks that we're going to solve what has been going on since 1953 in this meeting over Singapore, I mean, you're delusional. But I think the most important thing is that President Trump looks eyeball to eyeball with Kim Jong-un, who is a person that is economically destitute in his country, quite isolated internationally, and let him know that you have a chance. You have a chance to bring a brighter future to the people of North Korea, or you can continue down this path, and you will find yourself being the member of the Kim family that saw your family's rule come to an end. CAVUTO: Why do you think, Allen, that the North Koreans are doing this, that this -- this leader is doing this now? WEST: It's very simple, Neil. The game of international extortion has come to an end. When I was stationed over in Korea in 1995, that was during the Bill Clinton administration. That was when Kim's father was in charge there. And what they would, they would rattle their sabers. They would make their threats. And we would give them the financial aid and the food aid that would keep them sustained. That has ended. When you look at these sanctions, they are the toughest that we have ever had. We have a mini-naval blockade, pretty much so, that is out there intercepting any ships that are coming and going from North Korea. And that has put a stranglehold on him. And, furthermore, we're putting a lot of pressure on China as well. CAVUTO: Do you feel -- when you are watching this summit -- I'm thinking of having people like you monitoring these developments as they're coming. And since I will be covering it live tonight on FOX Business, which, if you don't get, Congressman, you should demand, but what are you... WEST: I do get it. CAVUTO: Very good. Do watch it. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: But, in all seriousness, what -- help me do this. What are you going to be sort of waiting for, wanting to see? WEST: The main thing I want to know is whether this process continue on. Where does it go from here? I didn't expect this to be the great end-all meeting, like your previous guest talked about. It is not going to be two weeks at Camp David or what have you. But what are going to be the initial markers that were laid down? And where do we continue on in this process? I would like to see what Secretary of State Mike Pompeo comes out and says. I would like to see what the national security adviser, John Bolton, comes out and says. I want to hear that the sanctions remain in place. I want to hear that we are giving them an opportunity over the next six months to a year to start the dismantling of their nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program. I also think that Japan wants to hear that they're going to have their hostages released as well. CAVUTO: All right, sir, always good seeing you. Thank you very much, Allen West... WEST: My pleasure. CAVUTO: ... for joining us, and your service to this country, incredible service, at that. WEST: Thanks, Neil. CAVUTO: All right. We were up about 5.25 points today. In fact, the markets have been doing just fine, as I said, throughout all of this. The read on what's more of a worry, what's going to be going on in Singapore tonight or what just transpired in Canada over the weekend, after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, two of the best from FOX Business joined me now. We have got Susan Li and Charlie Gasparino. And I am so glad you guys join me, because I need to make sense of how the markets are handling this whole Korea thing, the post-trade thing. CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Where did we end up today? CAVUTO: They are -- we're about up about five, seven points. But what is going on? SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. We came off of session highs, though. CAVUTO: Yes. (CROSSTALK) LI: But we are pushing closer to 2800 for S&P. That is the high that we haven't seen since March. And traders that I talk to say, you know, we could see a positive surprise from North Korea later on tonight, because it's not just a two-way summit. It's not just North Korea and the U.S. China is involved as well. We know Kim Jong-un flew to Singapore on an Air China jet. CAVUTO: Right. LI: If all of that goes well, and there's a positive surprise, there could be possibly some positive surprise in good rhetoric for the China-U.S. trade relationship as well. CAVUTO: As you have been reminding me, the underlying fundamentals are what markets respond to. And the earnings have been great. The balance sheets are good. GASPARINO: Right. Economy is getting better. CAVUTO: And even if things are going kablooey with our trading partners, it's OK? GASPARINO: Well, listen, everything looked hunky-dory in late 2007 to early 2008. And I remember when it -- when the switch went on, and it wasn't. And I would just say this. If Donald Trump gets peace in our time with this, the markets will go up, OK? Got you. If he gets nothing, and he just doesn't do anything bad, markets will trade off other issues. But this trade stuff that he's worked -- that he's doing, the role of the dice, I think the market isn't -- right now, the markets are just saying... CAVUTO: Because it doesn't think anything is going to happen. GASPARINO: We don't think it's going to happen. CAVUTO: Right. GASPARINO: But there has been sort of unexpected stuff that comes -- that came in the past. It always does. And let me tell you something. You're going to have -- you have tax cuts, which are going to increase the size of the deficit, meaning we're going to get marginally higher interest rates anyway, because we have to sell more debt. If you got that... CAVUTO: Not if the growth goes at the rate it's going. GASPARINO: But if it doesn't initially -- and, usually, it takes a little while -- if it doesn't, if it doesn't pay for itself, you are going to have a trade war on top of much higher interest rates. Not good. CAVUTO: So, there are a lot of worries about that. LI: Right. CAVUTO: When you talk to people, Susan -- and, of course, you sat down with the Canadian prime minister before everything hit the proverbial fan. There's a lot of ill will out there now. LI: Oh, yes. CAVUTO: And I'm wondering how that's reverberating. LI: Well, Neil, as I mentioned, it's actually making Justin Trudeau look pretty good in Canada, because, yesterday, if you went and watched any of the Canadian airwaves, read any Canadian newspaper... CAVUTO: Sort of rallying around the leader, right? LI: It's the big, bad U.S. bully coming in to tell us what to do. And if Justin Trudeau is standing up to him, well, hey, maybe he might not be a bad strong leader for Canada in the next elections, which he's behind in the polls in some... CAVUTO: But isn't that the expected response? I found it unfathomable, the comments that were made about Justin Trudeau, whatever you think of this trade deal. But you're going to rally around the leader, conservatives, liberals alike, right? LI: Correct. And that's what happened both sides of the aisle. So, in some ways, I guess there's been a bipartisan effect in Canada thanks to Donald Trump. CAVUTO: Right. Why do you think he did this, the president did this? Or Peter Navarro said there's a special place in hell for... (CROSSTALK) GASPARINO: I think that was all... CAVUTO: All drama? GASPARINO: Yes, gamesmanship for the Korean thing CAVUTO: In what way? GASPARINO: Well, to show that we're not going to take anybody's garbage, and we're going to fight you. And -- but -- but, that said, words do matter. And if you spit in the eye of the G7, which -- who are nominally -- at least -- at least in name -- people we can use to blunt the growth of China as an economic superpower looking to take over the world -- that's a real problem. Like I said, right now, the markets aren't recognizing that trade is an issue. They have grown comfortable with Trump. They like his -- most of his fiscal policies. They like his deregulatory agenda. They don't think he's going to press the button on trade. However, markets are often wrong. And if he does press the button, if there is a wide-ranging trade war, if China doesn't kick in what they're supposed to kick in after we let ZTE survive, if there's a problem with trade, and we got a trade problem, when we have higher interest rates, that could be a problem for these markets. LI: You just said markets are usually wrong. Is that what you said? GASPARINO: They're often wrong. LI: They're often wrong? Well, I'm looking at the Russell 2000, the small caps index, right? CAVUTO: That's right. LI: If there's rotation to small caps, what does that say about political risk? It says that people don't know -- they're going to smaller companies, not large ones, that might be more impacted by trade regulations. GASPARINO: They're also looking for yield and for growth, right? (CROSSTALK) LI: And yields below 3 percent still on a week... (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: But, so far, they're looking the other way, right? GASPARINO: I'm saying, you increase your risk profiles right before the markets usually blow up. Just -- that always -- that always happens. CAVUTO: That doesn't mean they will blow up. GASPARINO: But it often happens. CAVUTO: Always a half-empty -- someone is a Debbie Downer here. (LAUGHTER) LI: Yes. CAVUTO: All right, we will see what happens here. All right, in the meantime here, obviously, the summit, and that's getting a lot of attention here, but the other issue has to be whether this has gotten a little ahead of itself, and that some sort of a correction, some sort of a pullback is in order. I'm not talking about the markets. I'm talking about the expectations -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER GOVERNOR BILL RICHARDSON, D\u2014NEW MEXICO: The North Koreans will use that picture of the spy chief smiling, the jocular nature of that meeting, for their domestic political propaganda, because they -- the number one thing the North Koreans want, Neil, is to show that they're on the par. Two leaders, their leader and the president of United States, are in the same par. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: All right, so, does that mean that no one can smile? I don't know. Tara Maller is with us now, former CIA analyst, Counter terrorism -- Extremism Project senior policy adviser. Tara, what do you think, that you got to be very careful how much emotion you show one way or the other? TARA MALLER, SPOKESPERSON, COUNTER EXTREMISM PROJECT: You do have to be careful. But, at the end of the day, the North Koreans are going to use this for propaganda no matter what happens. They're going to use the photo-op, the symbolic nature of this. And you know what? That's fine. I'm sort of less concerned about some of these softer variables. They're all important, the body language, the photo-op. But what's really going to be important here at the end of the day, are there zones of agreement that President Trump and the North Koreans -- the U.S. and the North Koreans can reach through these, I think it's three meetings, really? It's a one-on-one with President Trump. And there's a more expanded bilateral, which I think Secretary Pompeo will sit in on, as well as General Kelly and perhaps a few others. And then I think there is perhaps a lunch following. At least, that's what been reported. So there's been a few opportunities here, but I don't think we want to set expectations too high. It's a good first step. There's going to need to be a long road map ahead to reach any sort of real outcome. CAVUTO: Yes. And, to your point, Tara -- and we have discussed this before -- the fact that they're meeting, we can get in the weeds and say, oh, what do they to have agree to or not. This is unprecedented. This is historic. Whether you're a Trump lover or hater, calm down. It is historic, in and of itself. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: Having said all of that, though, some are wondering, given the president's language and harsh response to G7 leaders, and particularly the leader of Canada, I'm wondering what that was about and what it might portend for this meeting. MALLER: Well, look, I did hear remarks coming out of the administration that that was sort of to lay the lead-up to North Korea, to show that Trump is strong and he's not going to back down by criticizing Trudeau. I think that was sort of fixing it after the fact. Really, what we need to see here going into this meeting in a well-prepared, clearly articulated strategy. I agree with you. This is a historical summit. Praise where praise is due to the administration for lining it up and getting it have to happen rather quickly. I am a little bit concerned about this first portion of the meeting, this one-on-one, where there's nobody else in the room but translators. I just think that leaves open a lot of room for potential volatility. And what I mean by that is, after that happens, you're just going to have both individuals' declarations of what actually transpired. And you could see some disputes after the meeting about what actually was said. I mean, we have seen that before with the Trump administration, and not in a situation that is this high-caliber, this high-pressure. CAVUTO: But they will have other meetings. They're starting out mano a mano with their translators, right? I mean, it's not as if they're going to -- the whole thing is that way. Right? MALLER: Agree. It's not as if the whole thing is that way, but that is supposedly the first meeting that is going to set the tone. We have heard President Trump himself say that, if he doesn't think things are going welcome, he might not even go forth with the meeting. CAVUTO: Yes. MALLER: That is -- those are his words, not mine. I'm not saying that is going to happen. CAVUTO: I hear you. MALLER: It could go quite well and set a very positive tone for the rest of this day. So, as President Trump likes to say, we will see what happens. But I do think that that one-on-one, I'm sort of surprised that Secretary Pompeo or somebody else didn't push to have perhaps one other person, to protect the president as well, right? The North Koreans can come out of that claiming that President Trump said things that he didn't say. CAVUTO: There might be a reason for all of this. But, Tara, we shall see. Tara Maller, thank you very, very much. MALLER: Thank you. CAVUTO: Again, we're just about four hours away from the historic sit-down here. There are a couple things you're going to want to watch, we can tell you right now -- right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: Closer and closer we be, four hours away now from the big sit- down. Talk Media News chief foreign correspondent Luke Vargas with the latest from the Singapore -- Luke. LUKE VARGAS, TALK MEDIA NEWS: Thanks for having me. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: What is it like there? How are things going there? VARGAS: Well, I mean, we're just hours away, the city here starting to wake up to probably one of the most historic days in diplomacy, for a city that has hosted a lot of big meetings in the past. I have to say, myself and a lot of other journalists were in that press briefing yesterday with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. And I think we're starting to be pretty confident. This man, Mike Pompeo, is going to pick up the pieces. Whatever comes out of the meeting today, he's a full-time secretary of state. Everyone believes that he speaks for Trump. And his schedule reflects this confidence, that there's going to be at least thread that can be found after today's meeting that the U.S. can take to our allies, South Korea and Japan. Pompeo is departing for Seoul, South Korea, tomorrow. And he heads to Beijing on Friday, again, just sort of cementing this notion that this U.S.-North Korean diplomacy isn't operating in isolation. It's part of a bigger diplomatic process that involves our allies. And, again, unlike Rex Tillerson before him, I think everyone believes here Mike Pompeo is willing to dedicate all of his energy to continuing whatever comes out of the Singapore process. Once again, you want to leave these talks in trusted hands. And I think Pompeo is giving off all the right signals. CAVUTO: Luke Vargas, thank you very, very much, the latest from Singapore there. And Luke is right. Others are confirming as well that they expect something to come of these talks, brief though they might be. We're going to be monitoring, of course, on FOX Business 9:00 p.m. When the talks begin, we will begin. And we will be on throughout the night, as long as it takes, to get you the latest, with concurrent foreign market reaction, particularly Chinese market reaction, Asian community market reaction, as that will extend overnight to futures trading and rest. Altogether, to put this in perspective, people will be betting money. We will be on it throughout the night. END <Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc.

            "article_content": "Former president endorses 81 Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms; RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel reacts on 'Outnumbered Overtime.' Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the socialist congressional candidate from New York who touts honesty and authenticity as her greatest strengths, used to describe herself as a follower of Adam Smith, the so-called father of capitalism -- and said that terms like \u201cfeminism\u201d and \u201cempowerment\u201d were \u201crelics from the past.\u201d Since then, Ocasio-Cortez has come out as an unapologetic democratic socialist, wishing to see greater taxation and expansion and creation of wide-ranging social programs such as a single-payer health care system, free education, and housing as a right. \u201cI think my strength is I\u2019m honest and authentic,\u201d she told \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah last week. Those qualities helped her in June to beat top Democrat Joe Crowley, whose name was floated as the next speaker of the U.S. House. But not that long ago, 28-year-old Ocasio-Cortez harbored a lot milder if not radically different views. During her time at Boston University, where she studied economics and international relations and graduated in 2011 with cum laude honors, she described herself as a believer in Adam Smith\u2019s analyses and wrote a number of blog posts hinting at her views, according to posts reviewed by Fox News. \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez believes in Mahatma Ghandi\u2019s methods, Adam Smith\u2019s analyses, and Pablo Neruda\u2019s love. Her experiences growing up in a Puerto Rican household, from the boroughs to beyond, has afforded her a uniquely American experience with all the tragedy and hilarity it accompanies,\u201d she described herself in a student-run publication called BU Culture Shock, which she co-founded. \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez believes in Mahatma Ghandi\u2019s methods, Adam Smith\u2019s analyses, and Pablo Neruda\u2019s love.\" In a 2009 blog post, Ocasio-Cortez called feminism into question, writing that \u201cthe terms \u2018feminism\u2019 and \u2018empowerment\u2019 don\u2019t seem to capture the priorities of our generation, and the words themselves sound like relics from the past, frumpy and outdated.\u201d \u201cWe no longer live in the same fight for equality of prior generations, we have moved to the widely accepted reality that marginalizing 50% of a given population doesn\u2019t make much sense, mathematically or socially,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe no longer live in the same fight for equality of prior generations.\" The New York Democrat could also learn a few things from herself, having written in a 2009 post that while health care in the U.S. is \u201cat its most critical crossroads\u201d in recent history, the debate about it is moving slowly for a \u201cgood reason.\u201d That reason being that \u201chealth care is largely an intersection of money and people, which means health care discussions often involve the prioritizing of people according to available funds. How can one possibly measure the needs of children, the elderly, the sick, and the healthy against one another?\u201d Most blog posts written during Ocasio-Cortez's reign at the publication, which include articles on issues like Donald Trump\u2019s 2012 run for president and Israel-Palestine conflict, aren\u2019t available and only a select few were reviewed by Fox News. Boston University\u2019s Howard Thurman Center, which sponsored the publication, said the archives couldn\u2019t be located as the staff at the center changed and new staffers lacked access to the old posts. Yet Ocasio-Cortez's claim of being a follower of a pro-capitalist economist will surely raise questions about her authenticity, as Smith, the 18th century Scottish economist, advocated free-market capitalism and opposed government regulations \u2013 contrary to what Ocasio-Cortez, a card-carrying Democratic Socialists of America member, now pitches on the campaign trail. \u201cThere\u2019s just no doubt about it,\u201d Howard Husock, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow, told Fox News about Smith being a polar opposite of the New York socialist. \u201cFirst of all, Adam Smith believed so strongly in price signals, which are telling us what\u2019s desired, what\u2019s being offered, it allows people who are selling things to adjust their prices to meet demand \u2013 they're just central to how the whole economy works.\u201d Democrat socialist candidate struggles to clarify her comment on Israel's 'occupation of Palestine.' \u201cSo as soon as you have Medicare for all, you essentially are abolishing price signals when it comes to health care. Because the government is not just a one more competitor or one more choice. It kills the whole playing field,\u201d Husock added. Jeffrey Miron, a director of economic studies at the Cato Institute and director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Economics at Harvard University, seconded that there are problems in reconciling one's views of a follower of Smith\u2019s analyses and being a democratic socialist. \u201cI do fully agree that there are tensions between being a Smithian and espousing the views that the social democrats espouse. In order to do massively more redistribution, you have to raise massively more taxes,\u201d Miron said, noting that that would have a negative impact on the economy. \u201cSmith would certainly never endorse that.\u201d \u201cIf Ocasio-Cortez were to say today that she\u2019s a Smithian, but yet advocate for things she advocates, she\u2019s trying to have a cake and eat it too,\u201d he added. \"If Ocasio-Cortez were to say today that she\u2019s a Smithian, but yet advocate for things she advocates, she\u2019s trying to have a cake and eat it too.\" But as Ocasio-Cortez was embracing her pro-capitalist views during her university years, signs of moving to the left became apparent as well. In an article about her getting malaria while studying abroad in Niger, she celebrated the cheap cost of malaria medication in the African country, suggesting Niger\u2019s health care was superior to that of the U.S. \u201cIn all, the blood test for malaria cost me USD$3 and the 10-day treatment was less than $10. Imagine that in a time where healthcare in the United States is at such a critical crossroads,\u201d she wrote. \"The blood test for malaria cost me USD$3 and the 10-day treatment was less than $10. Imagine that in a time where healthcare in the United States is at such a critical crossroads.\" She also questioned the definition of poverty and suggested people are happy in Niger thanks to having no material belongings. \u201cIt is neither a result of resignation to poverty nor an acceptance of such as a fact of life,\u201d she wrote, explaining why people in Niger appeared \u201chappy\u201d to her. \u201cOn the contrary, it may be due to having little material distractions that communities here are better able to focus on true sources of contentment \u2013 such as each other\u2019s presence. The warmth and familiarity of exchange among complete strangers is valued here,\u201d she added, asking \u201cWhere is the line between having less and choosing less?\u201d The campaign for Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t respond to Fox News\u2019 questions on whether she still subscribes to the analyses of Adam Smith and if she would call herself a feminist.",

            "article_content": "(Ann Voskamp) Dear Midlife, 40-Something Birthday, Blow out your dripping candles from the Dollar Store this week, circling there on your gluten-free birthday cake like a miniature candlelight vigil because there you are: Forty-something.\u00a0You\u2019re about half way there, old BraveHeart.\u00a0Half way. Barring an extravagant act of God and a lifetime of green smoothies, there is, at best, only half the track still stretching out ahead of you like your last invitation. So live backward from your 90th birthday cake. Always:\u00a0Live backward from the end goal. Look at who\u2019s in the room singing off tune on your 90th birthday \u00a0\u2013\u00a0and who are you making room for right now? I\u2019m hankering to be the weathered woman of 9 decades, hunched over her cake, looking around a room of babies slung on hips and gangly, grinning teenagers and the gathering of the generations who know the words to the Old Rugged Cross and Psalm 23 by heart and the language of thanks is their mother tongue. I envision a rising of accents and the richness of skin colors and a poverty of spirit that knows the luckiness of Jesus-grace, and I hear the raucous of a room of the gloriously rowdy and live your life backwards from that last birthday cake. Only the people you make priorities now will make you one of their priorities in the end. And all those unconventional priorities of yours? Trust that you\u2019d do them all over again: Have a baby in your 40s.\u00a0Adopt her, hold her, rock her, loose sleep over her, fall in love with her. Change diapers, change sheets, change course\u00a0\u2013\u00a0change everything in midlife, to be laughing nose to nose at the local pizza joint with your tousel-headed four-year-old wearing her scuffed up Peppa Pig crocks, four days before you turn 45. Making a small person one of your greatest priorities makes your life great. Read through university applications with one brave kid before supper and read Beatrix Potter with a little kid on your lap after supper and grow soporific with surprising grace. When you feel people stretching you thin, you feel your heart enlarging. Move someone with white hair and a slow gait right into the center of the crazy current of your life. Upend your agenda: Drive them to doctor appointments, get them a cup of coffee in the middle of the afternoon, fill their sleep machine with water before you turn out the last light, pat the back of their wrinkled hand, and embrace it all, right at the outset: Love is always inconvenient and inefficient and indestructible. Stay in love. I\u2019m holding on to this with all my life. Stay in touch, stay in truth and grace, and stay in the Story and, above all else:\u00a0stay in love. Life is too short to move on to anything else. And midlife is flat-out begging you: Risk it all.\u00a0Risk large, risk now, risk your heart, risk for what ultimately matters. Go back to school.\u00a0Go reconcile. Go make it right. Invest in a dream that terrifies you.\u00a0Do the hard thing that terrifies you. Start a business, a class, a soup kitchen, a friendship, a dinner club, a memoir, a church, a marathon, a family. Just start.\u00a0Start over. Risk is your friend who walks with you where you want to go. Risk is the friend who knows the way to where you want to go.\u00a0Enjoy risk\u2019s company. Live into something bigger than you, that will require more than you, that will require faith and hope and miracles and God.\u00a0Why waste your one life on any one\u2019s small box? Believe it: Life doesn\u2019t have to get easier to be good. All you have to do is just get closer to a good God. Commit to more than a prayer life. Make your life a prayer. Make your work your worship, make your days your doxology, make your life your liturgy, and make Christ your only King. Your work may burn up or cause you to burn out, but the prayers enfolded into the stacks of laundry, the stirred soup, the stairs swept\u00a0\u2013\u00a0they will survive fire. I am still learning, still staying hungry, still staying needy: The cure to an overwhelmed life begins with a daily overdose of Scripture. Leave a Bible open to the Psalms by the sink, on the desk, at the table, eat His book every time you eat because the truth is: Stay in His Story to stay walking on waves. What you focus on\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is what you become like. Focus on good\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and you\u2019ll see more good everywhere to focus on. And yet, truth is, after all this? Bottom line? You will look in the mirror and you\u2019ll see it in your eyes: You will have done a whole mess of things kinda shatteringly wrong, and I mean a whole lot more than throwing in a few lights with a load of darks. I mean the kind of life stuff that makes your heart hurt all the way up the edges of your rib cage and you will desperately wish you could turn around and do so much so very differently. Like: Throw more lifelines than stones. Give more grace than advice. Hunger for integrity more than popularity, celebrity, or prosperity, \u00a0\u2013\u00a0because your integrity is your only legacy. You\u2019ll wildly wish you had known sooner, before, that: The easy way to what you want\u00a0\u2013\u00a0isn\u2019t the same as the narrow way\u00a0to what you\u2019ll want for all eternity. Choosing the path of least resistance\u00a0\u2013\u00a0can turn out to be the greatest mistake of your life. And\u00a0do what feels good now\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and you could feel bad for longer than you ever imagined. This all will keep you up at night\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but trust that this brokenness is a gift: Being broken keeps you soft\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and it\u2019s exactly where there is broken and soft soil that there is growth. Let the rains come, let whatever needs to rain simply come, and grow whatever He needs to grow, however He needs to grow it, because He reigns and knows what is best, and in our tender surrender, the glory of our God wins. There may be another 40-something years left, there may only be another 16,425 days left. And honestly? As many days, as moments, between here and 90, or as many remain? These three are really all you can control everyday: Your grittiness, your gratefulness, and your givenness. Grit, gratefulness, givenness. And the carrying grace of a good God. That\u2019s ultimately what you\u2019ve got every day. So\u2026 when you\u2019re midlife and you go to blow out those forty-something candles? Let it simply be an exhale of\u00a0trusting hope that extinguishes flickering fears and\u00a0lengthens\u00a0the years into a\u00a0long meaningfulness because all of you was imagined by God, meant to be blaze right now in His story for His epic glory, so every day is your party and you can be fully and freely released, if you want to be, to let all of your moments eat the cake of amazing grace.

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" November 8, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" I'm Brian Kilmeade. I'm lucky enough to fill in for Tucker this evening. Now Tucker should be off enjoying a pre-planned vacation right now but instead he'll be joining us in just a few moments to discuss the disgusting display that occurred outside his house last night.\u00a0\nHe got a mob of Antifa for protesters. How do you know? They spray painted on his driveway calling themselves Smash Racism D.C., they appeared outside his house in Washington. These people banged on Tucker's door, they vandalized his driveway. They spray painted that symbol, they were chanting we know where you sleep at night and they returned to come back with a pipe bombs.\u00a0\nIsn't this great? We're not going to show you the video but just listen to their chants.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Carlson, we are outside your home and we want you to know we know where you sleep at night. Mail Bomb. Tucker Carlson, we will fight, we know where you sleep at night. Tucker Carlson, we will fight, we know where you sleep at night. Racist scumbag, leave town. Racist scumbag, leave town. Racist scumbag, leave town.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: You believe this? Now Tucker's wife was at home at the time. While Tucker will tell you himself what happened when she heard the banging on the door where she went. Meanwhile the D.C. police department says, they are investigating the entire incident as get this a hate crime and that's basically a first.\u00a0\nI know myself how terrible things like this are. I've been harassed by thugs like this before, followed me a couple of weeks ago for about a half hour with couple of cameras, try do inside a subway car full of people to attack me because I work at Fox.\u00a0\nFox News CEO Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace took action, they issued this statement a short time ago.\u00a0\nIt reads, \"The incident that took place at Tucker's home last night was reprehensible. The violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable. We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of views. Recent events across our country clearly highlight the need for more civil, respectful and inclusive national conversation.\u00a0\nThose of us in the media and in politics bear a special obligation to all Americans to find some common ground.\"\u00a0\nSeems like a statement everybody should agree with, right? But not everyone does, get this. Fox's Matthew Yglesias, I think is his name, whose Twitter profile boasts of his \"flexible morals\" tweeted this.\u00a0\n\"I honestly cannot empathize with Tucker Carlson's wife at all. I agree that protesting at her house was tactically unwise and shouldn't be done - but I am utterly unable to identify with her plight at any level.\"\u00a0\nTactically unwise, still we've been touched by the outpouring of support for Tucker Carlson from other media personalities, you might remember CNN's Brian Stelter, a regular critic of the show tweeted this out, \"Inexcusable. Whether you love or hate Carlson, we should be able to see that this behavior is wrong.\u00a0\nHis colleague Chris Cuomo responded to that quote, \"Wrong? If they did what is reported, it is criminal.\"\u00a0\nFormer Fox and NBC host Megyn Kelly was one of the first to defend Tucker tweeting this out, \"This has to stop. Who are we? What are we becoming? Tucker Carlson is tough and can handle a lot but he does not deserve this. His family does not deserve this. It's stomach-turning.\"\u00a0\nAnother show of support came from \"The Late Show\" host, Stephen Colbert. Even he tweeted this out, \"Fighting Tucker Carlson's ideas is an American right. Targeting is home, terrorizing his family is an act of monstrous cowardice. Obviously, don't do this but also take no pleasure in it happening. Feeding monsters just makes more monsters.\"\u00a0\nAnd there are many, many more statements like this. It's an outpouring that came in today, all to respond to it and taking it all in first hand is Tucker Carlson who is on a previously planned vacation and joining this via with the telephone.\u00a0\nTucker, that's the response, you're taping your show just before you go on the air. They're outside your house. What have the last 24 hours been like for you?\u00a0\nTUCKER CARLSON, HOST, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT, FOX NEWS: Well it's actually been really nice and affirming. I mean, so for every masked lunatic in front of my house there have been you know, a 100 people some of whom I don't agree with politically, calling or sending texts of support and kindness and it's just a reminder of what a really nice country it is.\u00a0\nAnd if you work in our businesses, you know you can lose sight of that because you see the lunatics but you know most people are not lunatics, most people are humane and decent and kind and it's just been a great reminder of that and really a wonderful experience.\u00a0\nBut what's it like to find out that your wife is hiding in the pantry because people are threatening her? I mean, it's upsetting and I guess, I would say this, I mean, I've characterized the Antifa people and people like them as protesters but they're not I mean they weren't protesting anything.\u00a0\nThe irony is that you know this is the one show that regularly invites people like that on--\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I know.\u00a0\nCARLSON: --to say what they think and if you have a point of view that we disagree with, we - you know I'll debate you but I still want to hear it because I think people should hear it and but they weren't trying to change my mind or advocate for a position. They were threatening my family to get me to stop talking.\u00a0\nAnd obviously I'm not going to because it's my job to talk and I have the support of Fox news and I'm grateful for that but then you think of all the people, most people in this country who don't have that lucky combination of circumstances and they really feel like they have to shut up, that they can't say what they think because they'll be punished.\u00a0\nI mean, this has a chilling effect on people's ability to speak and to think freely, that's the point, it's totalitarian in its intent and we should fight it.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: So, there's a couple things going on, you have your career, you have your opinions, are you going to change your answers? Absolutely no and this might be I guess, retro or sexist to say this but as a head of your household in many respects traditionally, don't you feel a responsibility to protect those who live with you, like your wife, like your family?\u00a0\nWhat is it like? What did she do as they were banging on your door, spray painting your driveway and shouting outside your house and this is more than a dozen people in black outfit? Where was she?\u00a0\nCARLSON: She was in the kitchen and let me say you know, if we find ourselves in a country where men aren't allowed to say they want to protect their wives you know, I don't want to live in that country, that's totally sick and unnatural. So of course, I feel that obligation, it's my deepest obligation and I feel it.\u00a0\nSo, I got a bunch of texts from people, my neighbors saying something terrible is going on in your house. And by the time I called, my wife had the police and my brother there. My brother, I have a very large brother who lives a couple blocks away, thank heaven.\u00a0\nAnd we're close so he was there immediately but so she standing in the kitchen waiting to go out to dinner and people start pounding and on the door, really getting the door hard and screaming and threatening and she thought it was a home invasion.\u00a0\nI mean, the truth is my wife even though she's married to me is not very political and not - I mean we live in Washington which is - and we raised our four children in Washington, it's not - believe it or not, a very political environment.\u00a0\nPeople don't talk about politics at dinner, there's kind of a gentleman's agreement to be nonpartisan and so she's not engaged in this stuff. I'm not sure she knew who Antifa was. She didn't do anything wrong. Why are they screaming at her? I mean the whole thing was completely grotesque and the effect is to make it you know impossible to like open your mail.\u00a0\nI mean one thing they did, I think the worst thing that they did was they put my home address on the internet and they put a poster right in front of my house with my home address on it and they filmed it, they taped it and they put the tape on the internet so.\u00a0\nYou know I can't have my kids stay home alone now and I'm a normal person. I live in a normal neighborhood. I'm not a talk show host trying to get off the year, I'm a father. I don't want to have those battles in my personal life. I don't think most people do and now they brought it right to my house and it's - I don't want to whine, I'm not a victim, I'm a happy person.\u00a0\nBut either you can see why I wouldn't like that and why I feel threatened by it and why I think that this is a threat to free expression to all of us and I mean that.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I agree and also we should, according to the story, the reports, your brother's address is up there too, right?\u00a0\nCARLSON: Oh, they put my brother's address up, they put my college roommates address up, my best friend who lives down the street from me, who I started \"The Daily Caller\" with, who is like my brother, has nothing to do with any of this.\u00a0\nAnd they put both of their home addresses up, my college roommate was on a trip you know, his wife is home with their little kids and he's got to get the police over there. My brother has a family too. I mean the whole thing is completely crazy and I should say just for the record that I would guess that the overwhelming majority of my neighbors are Democrats, probably don't agree with the single thing I think.\u00a0\nBut all of them are appalled by this. I mean we lose sight again of the fact that the country is overwhelmingly normal people who don't think this is acceptable and our conversation publicly has been hijacked by extremists like this and I worry that if we don't stand up to them and say, I'm sorry, this is not allowed, you can't threaten people into silence.\u00a0\nThe rest of us are very passive in the face of this like I think we know who these people are. In fact, I think one of the people screaming at my wife last night has been a guest on our show.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Really?\u00a0\nCARLSON: So, these are semi-public people - yes and I can't prove that, we're going to find out. But I'm thinking to myself two things, if you have something to say, you're always welcome to come back on and say it. Again, he doesn't want to say it, he does want to convince you.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Right.\u00a0\nCARLSON: He wants to scare you into shutting up but second why are the rest of us sitting back and allowing speech to be squelched like this. I mean nobody is for this really other than a tiny minority of people and yet they have control. How did we get here?\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Because they got away with it and I'm going to add this Tucker. So, you hear Antifa, you know we cover this every single day, you saw the bike racks being thrown, you saw the bricks being put through Starbucks' windows. These people, they yell, they scream and they're violent so that's got to really weigh in your mind. So, we've seen them in action before.\u00a0\nCARLSON: Well, they're absolutely violent. I mean, you know, I don't want to pretend to be the tough guy. I'm not a tough guy but I mean, I've been doing this a long time and I'm not personally - I don't feel threatened physically.\u00a0\nBut you know, I have five other people in my house and maybe they do and that's the point so if I'm walking down the street and someone comes up and says you know, I violently disagree with you.\u00a0\nOkay, you know, let me hear about it but to do this is a form of intimidation so why are we describing it as a protest. It's a protest in the sense that when the mafia tells your store owner you know, I'd hate to have this place destroyed.\u00a0\nThat's not a protest, it's a threat.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Exactly.\u00a0\nCARLSON: And that's what this is.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Hey Tucker, you're supposed to be on vacation. I appreciate you joining us. If anybody wants to know talk is going to be intimidated, watch his A block, that's the beginning of the show when he comes back.\u00a0\nYou just as - I have a hunch, you're not going to be pulling back.\u00a0\nCARLSON: Thank you Brian for capably filling in. I appreciate it.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Okay, Tucker Carlson, thanks, please go back to your vacation wherever it might be. Meanwhile 11 minutes now after the hour. Victor Davis Hanson, one of the deepest thinkers, respected thinkers out there. He's a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institute and he joins us right now.\u00a0\nVictor, you heard all that we want to talk about returning to civility. How do we first stop this now?\u00a0\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW AT THE HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, I think we have to - Tucker referred to `they' and he had to because he didn't know who they were but they're a John Smith or Jane Jones, I mean, they're actual individuals and we've lost all sense of deterrence.\u00a0\nWhat he described was not a protest, these were criminal acts and then trespassing, disturbing the peace or threats of physical violence, they all have penalties just as you disrupt a lecture at a university campus or you file a false accusation at Brett Kavanaugh to a federal investigator.\u00a0\nBut these are not prosecuted and we have this image of these guys that are doing these things are the desperate of society. In fact, many of them of the upper middle class and they're invested in their careers and the last thing they want is an arrest record.\u00a0\nAnd all we would have to do is have brave district attorneys find the individuals and then prosecute them and that would set an example. And then we need also the carrot Brian that of civic discourse. I mean, I'm not a Pollyanna, I believe in the first amendment.\u00a0\nOf course, we have to have free expression. We've had speech you know, Ronald Reagan said, let's have a bloodbath once. FDR said, let's not bring Nazism and elect Tom Dewey President.\u00a0\nSo, we've had that rough talk.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Right.\u00a0\nHANSON: But we need sort of a Hippocratic oath that we don't say what we're otherwise legally entitled to say, maybe we could just say, I pledge as a public intellectual or a celebrity or politician that I won't release the private information about my opponent.\u00a0\nI will not evoke the word `Nazism' or `Adolf Hitler' to demonize an opponent. I won't use scatology or profanity when I'm talking in the public sphere. I won't use physical violence or I won't touch somebody and have a whole list of things that we pledge that we won't do, even though they may be not always illegal.\u00a0\nBut they're certainly salvation and improper and they lead to this dissension and this savagery.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Victor, you didn't just wing that, you actually wrote that, you have specific tenets on what to follow and you knocked it down to the basics and some of what you just mentioned, I care to this. We're going to talk about it later in the show but also the way the press was acting with the President a day ago, that fills in all this. That fits in this box as well.\u00a0\nYou believe we got a fundamentally bring civics back to school. Secretary of education DeVos can try to make that happen. Why don't we do it?\u00a0\nHANSON: I think we need - we don't trust the masters of the universe at Facebook or Twitter to censor our speech but we as a nation have to get together and say, you know what, we need formal education in civics and that can be taught at the high school or college and we have a new example of what ethics are.\u00a0\nEthics or not just cosmic ideologies, it's treating people the way you want to be treated. Maybe we should just have a Hippocratic idea of do no harm, if nothing else to somebody when you engage them in discourse and we've had people in the media that have said terrible things on the air and accept it.\u00a0\nWe can stop that with shame and social pressure, I think.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Yes, we used to get that out of the household but it's not happening now so we got to stop it elsewhere. Victor Davis Hanson, thanks so much.\u00a0\nHANSON: Thank you.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Fox News Alert. Now, 12 people are dead after a gunman opens up fire at a California bar packed with college students. A Sheriff's deputy was killed trying to save others' lives. Trace Gallagher joins us now with more in the Thousand Oaks mass shooting. This has been covered all morning long on Fox and Friends, Trace and it's just getting worse.\u00a0\nTRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS REPORTER: Yes, yes, Brain, by all accounts, Ian David Long methodically attacked the Borderline bar shooting a security guard outside, then walking inside and shooting other security teams before turning the Glock 45-caliber handgun toward those in the bar area and dance floor.\u00a0\nWitnesses say, it appeared he knew exactly what he was doing and now we know why. Ian David Long was reportedly a regular at Borderline. A series of name friends say, they often went with him to the bar to have drinks and listen to music, saying it was a place that he appeared to be happy and yet in less than a minute, he turned the dance hall into a hell hole.\u00a0\nHere's video posted on Instagram where you can hear shots fired, watch this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\n(SHOTS FIRING)\u00a0\nGALLAGHER: Ventura County's sheriff's deputy Sergeant Ron Helus was the first officer in the bar. He exchanged gunfire with a suspect but was hit several times and died a short time later. Police say, the shooter had an extended magazine increasing the number of rounds, the gun could fire.\u00a0\nBut witnesses also say, he reloaded giving some people time to exit and scramble for the exits. It also appears the shooter, a former marine may have battled with PTSD, Brian and sadly, we have learned that former and Fox News Correspondent Adam Housley's 18-year old niece Alaina was among the victims. Brian.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Brother's daughter. Unbelievable. Trace Gallagher, thanks so much.\u00a0\nGALLAGHER: Sure.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: All right, meanwhile, Republicans appeared to triumph in Florida's Senate race and the Governor's race. Now Marco Rubio says Democrats are using underhanded tactics to try and steal the seat and the governor's seat. They'll be here next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: The midterms over or are they over? And the last two Senate races, we thought were going to the GOP, they seem to win on election night. I'm talking about Florida. I'm talking about Arizona. Thousands of uncounted ballots keep popping up though, mostly in the Democratic leaning areas. What is going on here and why these elections still up in the air?\u00a0\nSenator Marco Rubio's added. He's tweeted about it, saying this, \"Now Democrat lawyers are descending on Florida. They have been very clear, they aren't here to make sure that every vote is counted. They are here to change the results of the election and Broward County is where they plan to do.\"\u00a0\nSenator Marco Rubio joins us right now. Senator, what makes you think that?\u00a0\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO, R\u2014FLA.: Their words, they held a press conference and said that, we're not here to just have a recount, we're here to win and look, we have procedures in the law for closed elections and recounts. I have no problem with any of that. I have no problem with anyone availing themselves of what the law allows them to do. Here's my problem. My problem is this is focused on two counties and in particular one County. So, let me use an example. Bay County, Florida where Panama City is was hit by a Category 4 hurricane about four weeks to the day of this election. They were without power; you guys covered all this. They did all their ballots at a 52 percent return rate you know, a 52 percent turnout despite the hurricane.\u00a0\nThey did all their ballots, submitted them on time, they were done basically on election night, early the following morning, very early. Broward County 48 hours later, still counting and they didn't have a Category 4 hurricane and it's not the first time that they do this. Problem number one.\u00a0\nProblem number 2 is we don't know how many votes they have and neither do they. Either they don't know or they won't tell anybody, how many ballots are left to count. You know and so forth and so it's concerning when you go to sleep at 3:00 AM on Wednesday morning after the election and for example, Rick Scott is up by 60,000 votes - 54,000 votes, whatever it was.\u00a0\nToday it's at 17,000 and the only county's that are still reporting are Palm Beach and Broward.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Right.\u00a0\nRUBIO: Who have a history by the way, on these things. You know, Broward County lost a lawsuit to the Republican Party a while back because they were opening up absentee ballots and beginning to count them before they were supposed to, okay?\u00a0\nBroward county in August, this year in Broward county mysteriously or I should just say, let use that term, 5000 mail ballots appeared all of a sudden at 7:00 PM on Tuesday night of the election and it actually grew to 9000. When they were done counting those, a school board race that involves Ryan Petty, one of the Parkland fathers that was challenging a school board member suddenly the incumbent was able to barely but she did, avoid a runoff.\u00a0\nA judge race flipped at a 400 vote margin after these 9000 votes appeared. So, this is a pattern of at a minimum incompetence and it's embarrassing to the state. Voters deserve better, this is not even a partisan thing. This is a county that apparently cannot count votes as well as the county just got wiped out by hurricane.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: No matter what happens, you have a sitting governor up for this election. And Marco Rubio, you've been there, you just straighten this out. Brenda Snipes illegally destroyed ballots in 2016. She's still in charge. Now they can't count the ballots, they are supposed to have it up to 30 minutes after elections closes, it's still not done.\u00a0\nSo, I just talked to going to Governor Scott's office, he is a pressure tonight and he says, they understand there's got to be a recount, an automatic recount, first by machine. If it's still close then by hand. Now, we understand that Andrew Gillum says, I'm re - looks like he's going to retract his concession and he's going to look for a recount there as the votes beginning to close as well.\u00a0\nRUBIO: Yeah, look, recount is fine, the law provides for that and in the case of the governor's race and Gillum and DeSantis, they're going to take the ballots and feed them back in the machine and make sure the machine is accurately reflecting them.\u00a0\nIn the case of the Senate campaign, they're going to manually recount these ballots and what that means is, they're only going to manually recount undervotes and overvotes meaning ballots that voted for more than one candidate or ballots that did not vote for any candidate.\u00a0\nAnd they're going to look at it and see, was there a marking that showed a voter's intent. Now it has to be consistent throughout the ballots, if you put an x in a circle, you got to have put an x on all the circles, you can't just do it for one race. But that's where the lawyers get involved, that's where the fights begin to happen and that's where we have seen races in the past suddenly turn.\u00a0\nMy problem is if this was something we were seeing in multiple counties, it's in one county and it happens to be a very democratic county. Look, people have a right to be concerned about it.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Senator, real quick, Marc Elias is coming in, he's a Clinton attorney, and guess what, works for Perkins Coie and guess what, they hired Fusion GPS who hired Christopher Steele, we're back in the Dossier conversation. Mark Elias is back in our lives as a country. The Clinton lawyers are here and they're going to start putting a lawsuit together that the Senate vote, the punch for the Senate was way on the bottom of the ballots, separate, making it hard for people to vote.\u00a0\nSo, they're going to challenge this legally along with the recount, along with the ballots. We might have another mess in Florida but you're really standing up ahead of time instead of talking about it in the aftermath, crazy, Senator Marco Rubio, thanks so much.\u00a0\nRUBIO: Thank you.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Crazy, right? Meanwhile Democrats revealed their first priority since they now have the majority in the House coming up in January. Incoming House Intel Chair, Adam Schiff signaled his intent to expand the Russian probe, isn't that great? And Congressman Richard Neal said this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nREP. RICHARD NEAL, D\u2014MASS.: Yes, I think, we will, yes but I hope that the President would do this on his own largely because every President since Gerald R. Ford has voluntarily done this.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Tax returns, Mollie Hemmingway of \"The Federalist\" overheard something on the Acela train, yesterday. Mollie, you can add to this story. What did you hear from Jerry Nadler? Nice to see you.\u00a0\nMOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Great seeing you, yes, I was up in New York, I saw you when we were up there doing election coverage, took the train down and happened to sit right next to Jerry Nadler, the powerful incoming Chair of the House Judiciary Committee. Now we're starting to hear people say, yep, we're going to do a lot of investigations but when the midterm elections were happening, they said they weren't concerned about impeaching President for going after Kavanaugh.\u00a0\nWell, Jerry Nadler and various phone calls that he took and had while we were on the train said that in fact, one of the things that the Judiciary Committee plans to do is in fact, go after Justice Kavanaugh through one of the couple of different means. Either by going after the FBI for doing a fraudulent investigation in his view and relitigating all of that in front of the House Judiciary Committee and they discussed the promised imperil of what it would be like to impeach Justice Kavanaugh.\u00a0\nAnd they also said, they're all in on the Russian investigation, there's sort of a broad coordinated effort across multiple committees to in fact do the thing that they told voters, they weren't going to do during the 2018 midterms.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: So, Molly get this, you leave the New York, heading to D.C. and Jerry Nadler does not know who you are. He just happens to be talking loud on the phone revealing his strategy for his entire party which affects the country. I'm so glad he's got his hands on the wheel. Let's add to this, he also said, oops, we have a lot of people who got elected who happen to be moderate the might not be that allied with us, correct?\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: Well, he was more worried actually about the what was happening to the Democratic party's coalition, he feels they've lost working class voters, that those people are now going to Republicans, that they can no longer call themselves the party of the working class because the new voters that they're getting are the sort of never Trump style elite Republicans who he thinks hurt the overall brand of the Democratic Party.\u00a0\nAnd he was also worried that the thriving economy could pose problems because if anything bad happens to it, he's worried that Democrats will be blamed for it.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Wow, so you don't need to get that glass and put it to the wall to find out what he's saying, you just have to hop on the train and he's yelling it. Mollie Hemingway, thanks so much, you're always a reporter, always delivering, thanks so much.\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: Thanks.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Meanwhile, we have transgenders and trans-radicalism so why not trans-ageism. Mark Steyn with quite a bizarre story and it's out of the Netherlands but it's on this planet so we're covering it.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Hi. Transgenderism is increasingly a part of America life. Now a man wants to be transage. I'm talking about Emile Ratelband. He is asking a Dutch court to legally change his age from 69 to 49.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nEMILE RATELBAND, WANTS TO CHANGE HIS LEGAL AGE: I feel I suffer under my age. When I am really 49 again, I will have a baby again. I will buy a new car again. If I have that age again, I have hope again! I'm new again! And the whole future is there for me again!\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Ratelband also says that lowering his age will also let him do better at the job and dating markets. It sounds like a good deal. Author and Columnist Mark Steyn wants to weigh in here. Mark, why not? If we don't have to declare our gender, why declare an age?\u00a0\nMARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: No, we basically repeal the facts of life. So that on your Birth Certificate, you can leave the sex blank, and as they did with the baby in British Columbia because it's mother is nonbinary transgender. It wants the baby to make up its own mind about what sex it is.\u00a0\nYou can change the parent, a court in California put two fathers down on the birth certificate because they didn't want to figure out which one of them was actually genetically, we repealed the facts of life so why not repeal age.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: He says he will give up his pension. He's going to go all the way. He says, I'll give up my pension, I'll get a different car for 49-year olds instead of a 69-year old so he wants to stay with this.\u00a0\nSTEYN: Yes, well, that's actually where you tie together the social liberalism and the fiscal conservatism as moderate Republican governors always say because if he's offering to defy his pension for 20 years, if everybody was to demand they have 20 years knocked off their life, we could save social security just like that.\u00a0\nThe pension crisis of the western, the public pensions crisis would suddenly go away so in that sense if 50 is the new 30 as they say in the fashion magazines, let's make it literal and all defer our pensions for 20 years.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: So, Mark, what's my takeaway, I have to run but I want to feel better about myself after this segment because I've never been more confused. What's my takeaway?\u00a0\nSTEYN: Well, we all have the right to self-identify, Brian. I identify as Brian Kilmeade but for some reason it keeps getting me worse tables in restaurants.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: That's exactly it.\u00a0\nSTEYN: That's a positive way to look at these things.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Right, you don't want to be too young and have to show ID and not be able to get into bars because that's where Marc Steyn is the happiest.\u00a0\nSTEYN: That's right.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Mark Steyn, thanks so much.\u00a0\nSTEYN: Thanks a lot, Brian.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: The world's a better place with you here. Meanwhile now this. CNN's Jim Acosta has been banned from the White House. How will he get the attention he craves now I ask myself and then ask you, that story's next?\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: All right, during President Trump's news conference yesterday, CNN's Jim Acosta provoked a tirade from the President and then refused to surrender his microphone to a White House intern.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nJIM ACOSTA: Are you worried--\u00a0\nTRUMP: That's enough, that's enough.\u00a0\nACOSTA: Mr. President, I just want to ask - one of the other folks--\u00a0\nTRUMP: That's enough.\u00a0\nACOSTA: Pardon me Madam.\u00a0\nTRUMP: That's enough.\u00a0\nACOSTA: Mr. President, one of the questions if I may ask.\u00a0\nTRUMP: Put down the mic.\u00a0\nACOSTA: Mr. President, are you worried about indictments coming down in this investigation?\u00a0\nTRUMP: I'll tell you what. CNN should be ashamed of itself, having you working for them.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Well, just hours later Acosta's hard pass into the White House was deactivated. After the ban, the ladies of `The View' rushed to his defense.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nSUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: What I saw was a battery, not by Jim Acosta but by the young White House aide. When you are holding something, if I may, if you're holding something and you snatch this from me, this cup is now an extension of me and that means you've battered me. You've assaulted me.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Can you believe this? Joe contra covers media for `The Hill', she's a lawyer too. What is she talking about? He was told to sit down, told to give up the microphone and he didn't and now she's blaming the intern?\u00a0\nJOE CONCHA, REPORTER, THE HILL: How anybody can come to that conclusion after watching that video sober, mind you. The person who made that particular comments, Sunny Hostin, you're right, law degree, this isn't just some pundit they throw in the air, from Notre Dame.\u00a0\nCONCHA: So if anybody thinks that 21-year old intern was accosted Acosta, it's time to look into a new profession.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: So there's all types of theories out there Jim Acosta didn't really ask a question, his first words were, `I'd like to challenge you'. Who says that to the President? Ask a question, isn't that the theme. Ask a question to tell us, to get your story, don't make it about you, did he make it about him?\u00a0\nCONCHA: Jim Acosta, not just yesterday but for two years now has been making it about him for his own narcissistic purposes. Jim Acosta is not a serious White House correspondent, he's a 40 something member of a high school debate team who goes in there, takes a policy position usually obviously against the administration and debates the President or debates Sarah Huckabee Sanders and that's not the role of a White House correspondent.\u00a0\nCONCHA: He should be either, going forward, a campaign strategist, a campaign spokesperson on the Democratic side or perhaps an opinion hosting CNN primetime or pundit because that's what Jim Acosta really is.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Are you surprised that CNN backed him?\u00a0\nCONCHA: Backed him after this? Oh well, they promoted him Brian in January, despite all the antics that we've seen during these press conferences because they think, because Jim is becoming part of the story and not getting the story and because he's going viral that that's good for ratings that's good for business.\u00a0\nBut here's the thing though, CNN is now trailing in total viewers, the hallmark channel. In this news cycle and they're losing viewers year over year, this has been and you know this a gift to cable news, this news cycle. If you're not gaining in ratings in the Trump administration that's been unpredictable and completely quite frankly, insane at times in terms of all the information coming out, then you're doing something wrong.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: So the next chapter was 8:00 that same night, he goes back to the White House and he finds out, his hard pass has been deactivated, he taped it, went back and does need to be with Anderson Cooper. Did the White House hurt themselves and make more of a martyr then when he left because the story was Jeff Sessions not Jim Acosta? The night ended with Jim Acosta.\u00a0\nCONCHA: Right, you used the word martyr and that is exactly right. Jim Acosta is very accomplished at playing the victim, of being a victim of circumstance, of being innocent in these situations. Personally, the White House, I think whiffed here. They should not have revoked his press pass because again as you said it makes him a martyr.\u00a0\nIn the last administration, under President Obama in President Obama's first 36 solo press conferences, you know how many times Fox got called upon? 14 times. The least of any major news organization.\u00a0\nCONCHA: What they should have done was, don't give him the oxygen that he wants in terms of this attention. They should have just boxed him out quietly and sent their message that way, Brian.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Joe Concha, thanks so much.\u00a0\nCONCHA: Thank you sir.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Back to the media, still part of the story. Meanwhile it's time for the final exam, can you be the experts at remembering the slightly less famous news of the past week, that's next and I've been hitting the road on my book tour.\u00a0\nI may be coming to your town. Take a look at the next few stops. `Andrew Jackson, Miracle of New Orleans' now out in paperback coming to Massachusetts, this weekend.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: All right, it is time now for the New York edition of the `Final Exam' where we put two news expert against each other and there could only be one winner, we call the ultimate news champions. I better pick up the pace, I'm running out of time here.\u00a0\nHere are the tonight's contestants. Playing the role of Martha MacCallum, Martha MacCallum, she's an anchor on \"The Story\" every single night but only gets paid for four of them. Ed Henry is not hosting or anchoring \"The Story,\" he does not have a full time job, he's a cheap, national correspondent and together they're friends but not now. Am I right, guys?\u00a0\nMARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST: We're very big enemies right now.\u00a0\nED HENRY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: See, I get to fill in on her show and I'm worried if I win, I could be, she's not going to have me back.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: This has nothing to do with game. I don't care about your relationship.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: You better be smarter than me.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I want to teach the people at home that there can only be one winner and there's - everyone else is a loser, that's what I walk away with.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: That is true, that's right.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: You know the rules.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Good luck Ed.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: You cannot answer before I finish the questions. The first one to hit the buzzer, will see the siren, I will go to that person and you'll have a chance to top it. I'm not even sure if those are the rules because adlibbed them and I should have stuck to the prompter. Noted that for next time.\u00a0\nLet's go to the first question and see if Gabriella, our prompter can keep up with me, let's begin. The midterm elections can be a wild time and 2018 was no exception.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: It's true.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Which Senate candidate went off the rails in his concession speech and dropped the F bomb. MacCallum?\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Beto O'Rourke.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Beto O'Rourke. Let's not say a word, let's go to the tape and let it be the--\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nBETO O'ROURKE, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, D, TEXAS: In every single part of Texas, all of you. So, in the country, how do you do this. I'm so f****** proud of you guys.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHENRY: Boy, she's quick on the buzzer. I can't--\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Some networks chose to leave that word in. Crazy. All right, so he still has lost, he's one of the few not fighting for a recount.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Okay.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Meanwhile question number 2 now. Same contestants, different question. Which Congress woman lost to re-election because according to President Trump she showed him no love.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Ed Henry.\u00a0\nHENRY: Mia Love.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: It's Mia Love. Let's go to the tape.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: Mia Love gave me no love and she lost. Too bad, sorry about that Mia.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHENRY: I feel like I beat her by like a split second. She's so fast.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: That was a tricky question but yes, I did know that answer.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I didn't know there was some rivalry going on, I though Mia Love was a Trump Republican.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: She kept calling about some hostage that she wanted released but it didn't work out.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Okay, let's move on.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Yes.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Question number 3, same contestants, same outfits, three runners from all over the world took part in the 48th New York City Marathon, this past weekend and the male and female winters both hailed from Africa. Let me finish the question, you're both disqualified, I'll play alone.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: I think that didn't go off because I hit it too soon.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I'm not done with the question.\u00a0\nHENRY: If you hit it too soon, you lose, I think.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: I - did I hit it too soon? Sorry. Go ahead.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Ed is going go to the questions because you show great discipline. We will not deduct a point, we're hearing from the judges. Can you name either of their home countries?\u00a0\nHENRY: Had to hit it, Kenya.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Is Kenya one of the countries?\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The men's winner, Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia who finished in 2 hours 5 minutes and 59 seconds. Mary Keitany of Kenya was the women's winner finishing in 2 hours 22 minutes and 48 seconds her fourth marathon victory in five years.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHENRY: She's still--\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Congratulations.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: I'm more on--\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Let's take a quick look at the scorecard.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: I'm having more problems with the buzzer than the questions.\u00a0\nHENRY: She could finish the marathon in 30 minutes at this pace, I mean.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: But you jumped, it wasn't my fault, when you look back at the tape--\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: I know, I just want everyone to know that I'm having more troubles with the buzzer than the question.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: So, let's just check the scores right now. The official score is Ed 2, Martha 1. Now there's special rules for this question. No rules, it is multiple choice. Here we go. This is a multiple-choice question.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Okay, you don't have to be hovering over it for a while.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Ed Henry's favorite girl band is the Spice Girls. They're getting back together, they're going on tour but one Spice Girl's refusing to join. Is it a, Baby Spice; B, Posh Spice or c, Scary Spice. Martha.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: It's Victoria Beckham. Posh, the middle one.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Is that - I actually am not sure about that, let's go to the tape.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Finally confirming those rumors that have been swirling for months but there - there is but Victoria Beckham aka Posh Spice will not be there.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Wow.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: I just figured, it's not my favorite girl band but I just figured that she would be the one that says no because she always looks very grumpy and I figured she probably said, no.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Martha, I don't think she needs a job, that's the problem. But Mrs. Beckham plays well, Posh, I believe she has a spray on perfume.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: And Mr. Beckham, she has too, so she's doing fine.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I'm getting word that we are now tied at 2. This will be the final question and there'll only be one winner and here we go. This one is another multiple choice, there's a popular video online of an animal in Peru getting into a cab to go somewhere. What kind of animal is it a, Lama-\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Oh shoot, I totally--\u00a0\nKILMEADE: - b, Alpaca or c, a baby goat. Ed.\u00a0\nHENRY: If I don't know, if that but I believe it's Alpaca.

Now the movement is fracturing apart over anti-Semitism. Actress and MeToo leader, Alyssa Milano spoke at the 2018 Women's March, you may remember.\u00a0\nBut says she will not speaking in 2019 unless the group distance itself from the Nation of Islam President Louis Farrakhan. Farrakhan recently compared Jews to termites and earlier this year, declared that the powerful Jews are my enemy but despite all that Women's March leaders, Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory have refused to denounce him.\u00a0\nNow after the murder of 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Milano has had enough to her credit, she's also denounced the attack on our own Tucker Carlson's home as not okay. That's about it for us tonight. We had about 20 seconds to tell you we'll be back.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I'll be back again tomorrow night at 8:00 eastern time and by the way, if you have some time pick up 'Andrew Jackson, Miracle of New Orleans.'

            "article_content": "Republicans think law protects voter fraud, while Democrats believe it causes voter suppression PHOENIX \u2013 Democrats are continuing their legal battle against Arizona\u2019s \u201cballot harvesting\u201d law, claiming it was passed to dilute minority voting power. This comes even as a federal judge recently ruled the law was constitutional. The law, which makes it illegal for absentee voters to allow others to collect their completed absentee ballots and submit them to election officials on the voters' behalf,\u00a0with the exception of family members and caregivers,\u00a0was enacted in 2016. Under the law, if a person gets caught taking other people\u2019s completed ballots to the polls for them, he or she could face felony charges. \"Ballot harvesting,\" otherwise known as an absentee ballot collection, is when people collect other voters\u2019 completed ballots and take them to the polls on their behalf. (Fox News) The Arizona Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee sued the state and Maricopa County over the law. But it was upheld May 8 after U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes ruled the groups failed to show that the Arizona legislature passed the law with the intent of suppressing minority voters. Democrats have vowed to continue their legal fight. \u201cI respect the court\u2019s decision but I don\u2019t agree with it and that\u2019s why,\u201d said State Rep. Richard Andrade, D-Glendale about why the ruling was still being challenged. \u201cIt\u2019s something that really impacts certain people.\u201d Andrade said the law disenfranchises those who live in remote areas, working-class families, minorities and those with disabilities because they have a tough time getting to a post office. \u201cYou have your family to take care of and make sure you put food on the table and everything, they\u2019re not going to miss a day out of work\u2014or they might not be able to get away from their job to even stop by the county elections to drop off that ballot because they just don\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d Andrade said. \u201cWe are taking that luxury away from people and punishing them by saying, \u2018Hey, your vote doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\u201d Republicans argue the law is necessary to prevent voter fraud. State Rep. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, R-Scottsdale, who sponsored the bill,\u00a0said she was pleased the court upheld the law. \u201cThink about it. It\u2019s election season and you\u2019ve taken upon yourself to perhaps knock on someone\u2019s door or multiple doors and collect their ballot with, I\u2019m assuming, the intent to turn the ballot into the ballot box,\u201d Ugenti-Rita said. \u201cBut, in the event that doesn\u2019t happen, regardless of why it doesn\u2019t happen, you can see it that that has (an) impact on\u2026that person\u2019s ballot to the election box. But, then also on the outcome. So, it\u2019s not a practice that really has enough benefit to justify continuing to have it. So, that\u2019s why I sponsored the bill and the court agreed that it was within our statutory and constitutional authority.\u201d Voter fraud has become a national issue that has pitted Republicans against Democrats. Republicans, in an attempt to prevent voter fraud, have pushed for stringent ID and ballot harvesting laws as Democrats have argued those efforts are a veiled attempt to strip away minority voting power. Ugenti-Rita said the intent behind Arizona\u2019s law isn\u2019t partisan. Ballot fraud, she said, isn\u2019t a partisan issue. \u201cElections are critical and the outcome of an election is important and people have to have confidence in the outcome of an election,\u201d Ugenti-Rita said. \u201cThe best way to kind of effect your government is at the election box. So, election integrity is something that we have to safeguard. It doesn\u2019t make sense to allow a practice to exist that has the potential to increase fraud and undermine the outcome of election or that confidence in the election process.\u201d However, there are studies that\u00a0show voter fraud is not a widespread issue and has not impacted the outcome of elections. \u201cThere was not a case of voter fraud proven (in Arizona), but yet this proceeded through,\u201d Andrade said. The issue is critical in Arizona because the state relies heavily on mail-in voting. According to the Citizens Clean Elections Commission, about 80 percent of Arizona voters choose to receive their ballot in the mail. \u201cThere was not a case of voter fraud proven (in Arizona), but yet this proceeded through.\" The ballot harvesting issue in Arizona came before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 and the court suspended a ruling that would have temporarily blocked the law while it was making its way through the courts. The case is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. There\u2019s a possibility the appeal could end up in the U.S. Supreme Court again.",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: All right you have heard that Democratic candidate who is taking on Jim Jordan that said she would be among those not only repudiating Nancy Pelosi if she were to get to Capitol Hill and Democrats have the majority, but she would also work to, well, start from scratch on those tax cuts. That has been a major clarion call of Republicans trying to keep the House, that that's what you have to look forward to. Now, some people might welcome that. I would wager that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise thinks that you wouldn't like that. He joins us right now. Congressman, always good to have you. Thank you. REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA, HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: Good to be back with, Neil. And it's funny. You show these candidates on the Democrat side, and they repudiate Pelosi, and then they turn right around and they parrot Pelosi on the policies. She will vote with Nancy Pelosi right down the line to raise taxes again, reversing the success we're seeing in our economy in the middle class. Hardworking families are benefiting the most. Why would you want to reverse that with another Pelosi puppet? And we're seeing that with a lot of their candidates. CAVUTO: All right, so even though she said she would repudiate Pelosi, you say that she's arguing for the same things that was Ms. Pelosi is pushing for. SCALISE: Yes, she said she agrees with her policies. CAVUTO: Right, in other words, rescinding the tax cuts. Now, she then kind of went on to say that -- agrees that they are crumbs and that what the middle and lower classes have gotten are crumbs. How do you counter that in campaign ads and the Republican approach to keeping the House? SCALISE: Well, the first thing we do is continue to remind folks that there is a clear difference in this election in November. We cut taxes for everybody at every single income level. And the people benefiting the most are middle-class families, who were struggling under eight years of a weak economy under Barack Obama. So President Trump said, we want to make sure we rebuild our middle class. And that's happening. And, frankly, the regulation relief that we have provided is one of the big things, in addition to the tax cuts, that's bring those good manufacturing jobs back to America. Don't reverse that success. By the way, they also want to repeal ICE.  They want to abolish the very agency that's protecting our country from criminals and human traffickers. So we're going to remind people what's at stake in this election. By the way, we also want to make those tax cuts permanent. The temporary tax cuts, we're going to have a bill to let every Democrat who voted against cutting middle-class taxes, we're going to let them have a vote to actually make those successful tax cuts permanent. CAVUTO: So, let me ask you what could disrupt this, this recovery, because you're quite right. It's a very strong recovery. And there are hints it could get stronger still. But the one impediment, the one worry, these trade tariffs that could escalate. Many of your colleagues are concerned that the president is playing with a live grenade there. Are you? SCALISE: Well, you know, the president's made it real clear that he wants America to be treated fairly. And that's what's really going on here. There is a high-stakes negotiation. But go look at a lot of these countries, and you can start with Canada. They're a great friend of ours, Neil. But you know what? If you're a lot of industries in America and you try to go do business in Canada, there are huge barriers to getting your products in the Canadian markets. They don't have those same impediments when they try to bring their products here. All we're asking is for countries to treat us fairly. And I don't think that's something that is something that should be very controversial. But at the same time, we know we don't want a trade war. So let's get through these negotiations with better deals for America and let all of our-- not only our consumers benefit, but all of our companies that make products that build things in America, let's make sure we're not treated unfairly as well. CAVUTO: Every party has its extremes or -- and then wants to find its soul. There has been argument, as you know, Congressman, going on with Democrats, they don't know if they want to go the hard left route, the Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren route, or something more to the middle or at least moderate for Democrats, the Joe Biden route. Republicans are dealing with this as well when it comes to even considering who they want to be their next speaker. Jim Jordan is among those who might be throwing his hat into the ring. Your name has come up. Kevin McCarthy's name has come up. First of all, are you interested in that spot? Are you worried about the direction it's taking, because no one seems to know who would have the edge? SCALISE: No, I think -- first of all, I have said I'm not running. And we have got to stay focused on holding the majority and moving our agenda forward. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: But you said you're not running. You said -- I'm sorry, sir. You said you're not running. SCALISE: Right. CAVUTO: But a lot of people want you to. SCALISE: No, I mean, I think if you look right now, the majority of our conference is only focused on moving our agenda forward and holding the majority. We will have an opportunity in November to make sure that we're going to figure out who's going to have chairmanships and titles. But we're not worried about that right now, because Nancy Pelosi is speaker if we lose our focus. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: But do you want that person to be a conservative, sir? Do you want -- because that's the battle royal, right, I mean, whether it should be someone more mainstream, like a Paul Ryan, maybe even a Kevin McCarthy, someone a little bit more to the right. It seems to be a soul kind of a question. SCALISE: I think, in the end, if you look at where we are today, and Kevin McCarthy, all of us -- Newt Gingrich would tell you this Republican majority is much more conservative than the majority we had 1994. And so whatever the labels are today, they change over time. But, at the end, we're working with President Trump to move a conservative agenda forward. And we have been successful. I want us to be even more successful. We, by the way, out of the House passed a repeal and replace of Obamacare, something that would actually lower health premiums and create a private marketplace for health care that doesn't exist today. That bill fell by one vote in the Senate. Let's go get some more Republican senators in November, and I think we will. And then let's come back at that. Let's keep building on the success of the tax cuts, keep creating more jobs, get health care prices under control, get this economy moving again and get spending under control. That's what we want to do next year. But we can't do that if Nancy Pelosi is speaker. CAVUTO: In October, a lot of Americans are going to be facing huge premium increases because of that health care law. And because Republicans have the run of the table, control the House and the Senate and the White House, are you afraid voters are going to blame that on you? SCALISE: I think if we were not successful in getting the tax cut bill passed, they would have. And they would have been right to do that. What you can look at right now is a House Republican majority that passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare that would have actually lowered premiums. And I would put that bill up against anything else that's out there to show how we would have actually helped families be in control of their health care decisions again. The bill failed by one vote in the Senate. We all know. We saw the -- the infamous thumb going down. But, Neil, we know -- we know also that this is a really good field out there for Republicans to get more Senate seats. CAVUTO: Are you angry at John McCain? You talked about the thumb going down. That was John McCain's thumb. SCALISE: What I was angry at is, the Senate didn't stay and figure out how to -- how to get the job done. They fell one vote short. But I also know this. They want to come back with more Republican senators and get it done. And we're going to keep at it too. We would still have to pass a bill through the House. And that wouldn't be easy, but we would do it. They have got to do it as well. But we -- it all starts with these elections in November. CAVUTO: You know, Congressman, what do you make of the president taking away the security clearance of former CIA Director Brennan, and a hint of doing the same to a number of others? SCALISE: Well, I was surprised that Brennan had kept his security clearance for so long. I mean, he wasn't being of any value to the administration. And he's just going out there and, frankly, I think continuing this kind of partisan witch-hunt, that he's out there bashing the president for things that he's not even familiar with, just because it seemed cool on the left to bash the president. That's not what those security clearances are supposed to be for. They're supposed to be there to provide value to the administration. And if they're not being used to help our country be more secure, then why are they there? It's not some birthright. CAVUTO: All right, so when he went on the very next day right to write an editorial in The New York Times, sir, to say that the president's notion that there was no collusion is hogwash, what does he know that we don't? SCALISE: Well, he ought to say what that is, because there have been a lot of investigations, including what the House has done, to see if there was any collusion between any of the campaigns. And we found none. And so, if he's got some new evidence, he ought to be getting it out there. But to continue just going on and making blanket accusations with no fact behind it, I think people are starting to get fed up with that. We have seen some of the problems within the FBI and over at Justice. Let's go and get this agency cleaned up again. America needs and deserves a Justice Department and an FBI that's working for them every day without a political bias. And if somebody over there -- and we have seen, unfortunately, a number of people over there that had political biases. They were literally trying to derail the presidency of Donald Trump. And whether the name is Donald Trump or Barack Obama, those agencies shouldn't be working to try to undermine our own government. And so we're going to continue rooting out those kind of bad apples. I would hope the agency would work with us too, so that they could get rid of the bad actors and then focus on keeping this country safe. CAVUTO: Congressman Scalise, thank you very, very much. Hope you continue to feel well. Good seeing you. SCALISE: Feeling great. Great to be back with you, Neil. CAVUTO: Very good, Steve Scalise.

It's unclear whether the roughly 1,500 people mistakenly\u00a0registered to vote by the Department of Motor Vehicles\u00a0cast ballots in California's June primary, the state's top elections official said Tuesday. Secretary of State Alex Padilla said his office is investigating the registration error and working with counties to make sure ineligible people don't vote in the upcoming election\u00a0Nov. 6, as early voting began this week. \"I remain deeply frustrated and disappointed that persistent errors by the DMV and CDT [California Department of Technology] have undermined public confidence,\" Padilla wrote in a letter calling for an audit, according to San Diego\u2019s KNSD-TV. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said his office is investigating\u00a0the roughly 1,500 people mistakenly\u00a0registered to vote by the Department of Motor Vehicles. (California Secretary of State website) The DMV said the mistakes occurred because of a\u00a0processing error that affected people who are not legal U.S. citizens, Fresno\u2019s FOX 26 reported. California held its primary election June 6, while the incorrect registrations happened between April 23 and Sept. 25, according to the DMV. \u201cThese mistakes from the DMV are absolutely unacceptable,\u201d Padilla said. \"My concern is it risks jeopardizing confidence in the electoral process.\" \u201cThese mistakes from the DMV are absolutely unacceptable. ... My concern is it risks jeopardizing confidence in the electoral process.\" Padilla said the estimated 1,500 people either told the DMV they were ineligible or didn't confirm their eligibility but were registered anyway. The group\u00a0included at least one noncitizen living legally in the state and potentially more. People under 18 or those ineligible to vote because of a criminal conviction could have also been included in error, Padilla said. The DMV said none of the people mistakenly registered are living in the country illegally. The secretary of state will cancel incorrect registrations, Jessica Gonzalez, a DMV spokeswoman, told KNSD-TV. People were mistakenly registered through no fault of their own, Padilla said, and his office is removing them from the voter rolls. DMV Director Jean Shiomoto also\u00a0said in a statement that the department is working quickly to fix the problem, saying\u00a0they've \"updated the programming and added additional safeguards to improve this process,\u201d the Los Angeles Times\u00a0reported. California's motor voter law took effect in April, allowing\u00a0residents to automatically register to vote through the DMV. Since then, people have newly registered or updated their voter registration more than 3 million times, Gonzalez said. The Motor Voter program was created\u00a0to\u00a0make it easier for people to register,\u00a0boosting voter turnout. Freezing the program is \"certainly on the table,\"\u00a0Padilla said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the homework as we speak of what does that mean and what it would take,\u201d Padilla said at a Tuesday news conference, the\u00a0San Luis Obispo Tribune\u00a0reported. The DMV announced last month it might\u00a0have botched about 23,000 voter registrations because of a separate error. As a consequence of the mistake, the department sent the secretary of state's office incorrect information for some voters. The error mostly affected\u00a0people's vote-by-mail, language and political party selections, according to the department. The DMV found out about the roughly\u00a01,500 mistaken registrations after the L.A. Times' Monday\u00a0report\u00a0on a Canadian who was registered incorrectly.\u00a0The green card holder contacted the Times on Sept. 30 because he received a voter registration notice in the mail after trying\u00a0to replace his driver's license at the DMV, according to the paper \u201cWhen I saw that card, I just threw it out,\u201d Marquis said. \u201cI know I\u2019m not going to vote. I\u2019m not allowed to vote, it\u2019s stupid that I should be registered to vote,\u201d he told the Times. The DMV and Padilla's office didn't specify how many noncitizens were registered.

            "article_content": "GOP candidates tout President Trump's victories while Democratic hopefuls seek to highlight Cabinet scandals; Peter Doocy reports from Capitol Hill. Democratic Party leaders are encouraging their candidates to focus on an economic message rather their opposition to President Trump as they campaign for the November midterm elections. I would think twice about that idea if I were a Democrat running for office. After eight years of stagnation, the economy is doing quite well under President Trump \u2013 and the American people know it. The Democrats\u2019 messaging concerns grew out of a February poll financed by Priorities USA, the Democrats\u2019 largest super PAC (political action committee). Based on this poll, Priorities advised that Democrats \u201cmust reassert control over the economic narrative\u201d by focusing \u201con economic issues like taxes and health care and not allow themselves to be sidetracked and distracted by Trump\u2019s latest tweets.\u201d The super PAC encouraged Democrats to focus on how \u201cTrump\u2019s economic policies\u201d of tax cuts and deregulation \u201cwill further enrich the wealthy and big corporations while hurting the middle class.\u201d What passes for progressive economic policy boils down to: increasing taxes on those who create wealth; creating government programs through which Democrats can redistribute that wealth to potential voters; and repeating disingenuous sound bites about fairness and decency. This class warfare narrative leaves little room for policies that might actually encourage economic growth. It wasn\u2019t always this way. In my lifetime, Democratic presidents have proudly and successfully advocated for polices to promote economic growth. President Kennedy fought for tax cuts to create an economic tide that he famously noted would lift all boats in every economic class. President Clinton raised taxes early in his presidency, but later admitted that he raised them too much. He then cut capital gains taxes, reformed welfare, deregulated banks, balanced the budget and intentionally shrank the size of government \u2013 announcing that the era of big government was over. Democrats don\u2019t sound like that anymore. Rather than the party of John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton, they are now the party embracing progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-described \u201cDemocratic Socialist.\u201d In today\u2019s Democratic Party, even a big-government liberal like Hillary Clinton can claim she was too much of a capitalist to satisfy her party\u2019s left wing. For progressive Democrats, economic growth is readily sacrificed to taxation, redistribution \u2013 and expanding the size, influence and power of government. With the failure of President Obama\u2019s progressive economic policies so fresh in our memories, it\u2019s hard to believe the Democrats\u2019 patently political approach to economic policy will pass muster with American voters. As the CEO of CKE Restaurants during the Obama presidency, I was often confronted by journalists who would note that people were dropping out of the labor force discouraged by their inability to find good-paying jobs. Reporters would ask how restaurants could employ people in part-time or entry-level positions with salaries that were insufficient to support their families, driving them to seek government assistance. The discussion would invariably turn to a $15 minimum wage, automation and \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d That\u2019s not how the interviews go anymore. Sixteen months into the Trump presidency, the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 18 years. Despite a record 155 million people being employed, job openings in March were also at a record high of 6.6 million. There are more good-paying working-class jobs and more openings for good-paying jobs. For example, the number of people working in construction is at its highest level since June of 2008 and there were an additional 248,000 job openings in March. The number of people working in manufacturing is at its highest level since December of 2008, with 391,000 additional job openings. According to a recent survey by the National Association of Manufacturers, 72 percent of manufacturers are increasing workers\u2019 wages and benefits, while 77 percent are hiring more workers. Much to progressives\u2019 dismay, over the past 16 months the economy has done a 180-degree turn. We\u2019ve gone from an economy where the problem was workers being unable to find good-paying jobs to an economy where the problem is businesses being unable to find workers to fill good-paying jobs. For working- and middle-class Americans, that change is huge. It was the result of President Trump lowering taxes and shrinking the size of government through deregulation. It was not the result of higher taxes or expanded government benefit programs. In fact, the number of Americans dependent on government benefits is declining. The monthly average of initial unemployment benefit claims is at a low last seen 45 years ago. The number of people receiving SNAP benefits (food stamps) has also dropped \u2013 by over 2.5 million people since President Trump took office. President Trump\u2019s policies are having a tremendous positive impact on the lives of Americans of all classes and backgrounds. More people are working, there are more job openings, and fewer people are dependent on government. As businesses compete for employees, wages will rise. The progressives\u2019 boogeyman \u2013 income inequality \u2013 will decline. Talk about a capitalist comeback! This capitalist economic tide is lifting all boats. Focusing on the economy may well be the biggest favor Democrats could do for Republicans in the midterms.",

Walking the streets of Detroit\u2019s working-class African American neighborhoods, Republican Senate candidate\u00a0John James seems at home \u2013 maybe because he is. He can point out where his parents shopped for groceries, where his dad started a trucking company, which library he went to.

She drew from her experience growing up in Nigeria during a military dictatorship, and said , \"America always felt aspirational \u2014 but today the political discourse in America is from the land of the absurd.\" The writer challenged graduates to be \"citizen leaders,\" seeking out what is right. \"Even if there is no value in the other side, there is value in knowing what the position is,\" she said. She referenced the concept of fake news and fake facts perpetuated after the election of President Donald Trump. \"If you are reporting about the sun rising in the east, you don't need to hear about the other side because there is no other side,\" Ngozi Adichie said. Her message rang true for graduating senior Priscilla Guo, who mentioned Harvard's Latin motto of \"Veritas,\" or \"truth.\" \"Veritas is more than just a motto,\" Guo said. \"It was her asking that we acknowledge our ignorances, which struck me. She noted that ignorance acknowledged is opportunity. I walked away from her speech thinking that acknowledging what I do not know can be both powerful and enlightening in my quest for truth and justice.\" Ngozi Adichie's work has been translated into more than 30 languages. She is known for novels including \"Half of a Yellow Sun\" and \"Americanah,\" which explores how a young Nigerian encounters race in America. She also helped found Farafina Trust, a nonprofit that promotes reading and writing. Ngozi Adichie was awarded a 2011 to 2012 fellowship to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard.",

Bernie Sanders\u2019 message of income inequality resonated with many voters in 2016 -- and now the senator himself may know how the other half lives. A financial disclosure\u00a0document filed in May shows that the indepedent lawmaker from Vermont made more than $1 million in 2017, given him income of that figure or more for the second year in a row,\u00a0VTDigger reported. Most of that income \u2013 $885,767 \u2013 came from cash advances and royalties for his 2016 book, \u201cOur Revolution,\u201d which recounted the Sanders' failed bid for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. The same book also outlined the political ideas that helped Sanders pose a strong threat to Hillary Clinton's bid for nomination. The remaining $174,000 of Sanders' income for last year came from his Senate salary. Sanders has long brandished his credentials as one of the \u201cpoorest\u201d members of Congress to rally against income inequality, a threat the senator has called \u201cthe great moral issue of our time.\u201d But the senator\u2019s income places him high above the national threshold for qualifying for the so-called \"One Percent,\" the group of super-wealthy individuals that is supposedly knocking U.S. society out of balance. According to a 2013 Economic Policy Institute report, a family needs an income of $389,436 to be in the top 1 percent nationally. When asked by VTDigger whether Sanders\u2019 income damages his credibility as an advocate for average Americans, the senator\u2019s senior political adviser dismissed the question as \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cBernie Sanders continues to fight for working-class people across this country, so I think it\u2019s a pretty ridiculous question,\u201d Jeff Weaver said. \u201cBernie Sanders continues to fight for working-class people across this country, so I think it\u2019s a pretty ridiculous question.\u201d Sanders is reportedly working on a follow-up book, titled, \u201cWhere We Go from Here,\u201d scheduled for an Oct. 30 release. Sanders\u2019 socialist \u201cauthenticity\u201d has been challenged before.

            "article_content": "Several political candidates have been accused of padding their resumes as they hit the campaign trail in recent months. (Julia Salazar for State Senate/Facebook) Within the past year, several political candidates have gone to great lengths to prove they're worthy of election \u2014 even if that means exaggerating on their resumes to get ahead. From faking diplomas to spreading questionable details about their family backgrounds, many politicians have been accused of misleading their constituents in recent months. One recurring lie -- about education -- has struck many as especially disturbing. In September,\u00a0an American Working Families Party candidate was forced to quit an Oregon state legislative race after reports surfaced that she falsely claimed she possessed a bachelor's degree. A month earlier, a Florida state House candidate admitted to lying about her college degree and dropped out of the race. Some of these false statements have caught up with the candidates, as in the latter case. However, some have continued to push through, despite controversies surrounding their campaigns. Here's a list of some aspiring lawmakers who have faced critical public scrutiny about their backgrounds. Amanda La Bell, who was accused of making a false statement about her education in the official Oregon voter guide, has dropped out of an Oregon state legislative race. (The Bulletin via Associated Press) Amanda La Bell reportedly dropped out of Oregon's race for House District 54 following false claims about her college education. The American Working Families Party nominee's exit came shortly after The Bulletin reported La Bell, 41, lied on an official state Voters Pamphlet about earning a bachelor's degree from Valdosta State University in Georgia \u2014 a class C felony, the newspaper pointed out. The report prompted La Bell to clarify what she called an \"oversight\" that occurred while her team scrambled to kick off her campaign. OREGON CANDIDATE AMANDA LA BELL BOWS OUT OVER FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT UNIVERSITY DEGREE: REPORTS \u201cRegarding my college education, I attended Gulf Coast Community College for two years then transferred to Valdosta State University in the pursuit of my Bachelors of Arts in Music,\u201d she told the paper. \u201cHowever, after one semester at Valdosta State University, I had to withdraw and enter the workforce. Through the years I tried to re-enter college but, like many working families, I faced significant barriers to completing my degree.\u201d La Bell apologized for the error, which she said she didn't catch \"until it was too late to correct.\" Melissa Howard, candidate for a Florida state House seat, withdrew from the election after admitting to lying about her college credentials. (Facebook) A Republican Florida House candidate dropped out of the race in August after admitting to lying about having a college degree. Melissa Howard agreed to\u00a0serve 90 days of probation and completing 25 hours of community service\u00a0to escape prosecution for misrepresenting her academic standing. FLORIDA HOUSE CANDIDATE WHO LIED ABOUT COLLEGE GRADUATION DROPS OUT OF RACE Weeks before Florida's primary election, Howard posted a photo of herself on Facebook with what looked like a Miami University diploma in addition to college transcripts. Shortly after, a lawyer for Miami University in\u00a0Oxford, Ohio, noticed distinct differences between Howard's alleged diploma and ones issued\u00a0in 1996 \u2014 the year she claimed she graduated. The school later said in a statement she attended the school but never graduated. Howard acknowledged that she didn't graduate from the school before withdrawing her name from the race. Julia Salazar, a Democratic socialist candidate for New York state Senate, has repeatedly come under fire for discrepancies in her bio. (AP) Voters started to question the background of\u00a0Julia Salazar, a Democratic socialist candidate for New York state Senate, after an article in Tablet revealed discrepancies in parts of her biography. Salazar, 27, came under fire for telling reporters she was an immigrant from Colombia who struggled financially growing up when in reality\u00a0she was born in Florida and had hundreds of thousands of dollars in a trust fund. Her brother and her mother voiced concerns about statements she made regarding her childhood, specifically that she was born into a \"working-class\" family and her mom never graduated college. \u201cWe were very much middle class. We had a house in Jupiter along the river, it was in a beautiful neighborhood,\u201d her brother Alex told City & State. \u201cI feel very strongly about my family and I want to tell the truth.\u201d DEM SOCIALIST CANDIDATE JULIA SALAZAR'S MOTHER AND BROTHER EXPOSE MORE INCONSISTENCIES IN HER BIO Many also took issue with\u00a0Salazar's political and religious conversion during her years at Columbia University, where she transformed from an anti-abortion Christian Republican to a hard-left Jewish Democrat. One group revoked its endorsement after learning Salazar hadn't graduated from Columbia, as she said on its survey. Salazar said she \"inadvertently misrepresented\" her family's history and chalked up some misleading statements to mistakes by staff. The misleading information didn't seem to damage her reputation too much, however.\u00a0Salazar ended up winning the Democratic primary for a state Senate seat in Brooklyn on Sept. 13, defeating eight-term incumbent Sen. Martin Dilan. Democrat Andy Kim, running for New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, is facing criticism for his comments about working under a Republican administration. (Facebook) Democrat Andy Kim is running against incumbent Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur in a tight race for New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. As the pair face off in a race many polls declare a toss-up, apparent exaggerations in Kim's resume have come to light. For instance, Kim boasted about working under both Republican and Democratic presidents\u00a0\u2014 most recently serving as\u00a0former President Barack Obama's national security adviser. But Kim didn't have as much experience working with a Republican leader as he suggested. Technically he hasn't been employed by a Republican president,\u00a0Washington Post fact checkers\u00a0first reported. Kim's LinkedIn page claims he worked as a conflict management specialist for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for \u201cless than a year\u201d during the Bush era in 2005. The position was entry level and he left after five months. DEM CANDIDATE BOASTS WORKING FOR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT AFTER 5-MONTH STINT AS ENTRY-LEVEL CIVIL SERVANT: REPORT However, Zack Carroll,\u00a0Kim\u2019s campaign manager, stood by the message Kim spread in his campaign ad, in which he stated he \"worked under both Democratic and Republican Administrations.\" \u201cWhile working at USAID under the Bush administration, Andy served in the Africa bureau working on U.S. response to conflict-related crises across Africa, including national security concerns related to terrorism in Somalia and genocide and child soldiers concerns in Sudan/Uganda. Andy worked closely with officials from the Pentagon, State Department, and other national security departments to develop comprehensive foreign policy responses to these and other crises,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pulled off an upset victory over incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley in New York\u2019s Democratic primary. Who is the 28-year-old candidate who beat the 56-year-old that has been in congress since 1999? Democratic candidates around the country now seek their blessing. Americans are joining their ranks by the thousands, rapidly expanding the group's membership rolls in just a few years. And a sharply leftist political agenda that once produced eye rolls \u2013 on everything from their opposition to capitalism to their questioning the very existence of prisons \u2013 has become a serious topic of discussion on social media, and in mainstream political debate. In short, it\u2019s going according to a plan by the Democratic Socialists of America, a group that\u2019s dedicated to pushing an anti-capitalist, socialist platform by infiltrating and working within the Democratic Party, and pushing it further and further to the left. \u201cProgressive and socialist candidates who openly reject the neoliberal mainstream Democratic agenda may choose for pragmatic reasons to use the Democratic Party ballot line in partisan races,\u201d wrote Joseph M. Schwartz, vice chairman of the DSA,\u00a0in the socialist Jacobin Magazine last August. \u201cBut whatever ballot line the movement chooses to use, we must always be working to increase the independent power of labor and the left.\u201d The Democratic Socialists playbook, detailed on its website, calls for a methodical march to becoming a truly national force \u2013 where they can run candidates and push ideas under a Socialist Party banner\u00a0\u2013 by first working from within the Democratic establishment. That strategy paid off big with the recent congressional primary victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old DSA member who much of the media has ordained the new face of the Democratic Party. Ocasio-Cortez plans to stump for other Democratic primary candidates in the coming days, in Kansas and Michigan. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described Democratic socialist, reportedly will join for one of the stops. The DSA, which is not a formal political party but bills itself as the largest socialist organization in the U.S., is working its way into the Democratic Party in part because of its failure to advance its own brand with a voting public reflexively suspicious of hard-left socialist policies. So it set a goal of working with groups devoted to a wide range of issues like health care, college debt, immigration, and racism to see socialism \u2013 and Democratic Socialist political candidates\u00a0\u2013 as the vehicle for policy changes. \u201cIf we don\u2019t relate politically to social forces bigger than our own, DSA could devolve into merely a large socialist sect or subculture,\u201d wrote Schwartz and his co-author, Bhaskar Sunkara, founder of Jacobin Magazine. The organization also has recognized it needs to broaden the diversity of its own membership, which it concedes is predominately white, male and upper-income. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic Socialist who scored an upset victory in the New York Democratic congressional primary \u201cWe will focus on overcoming this historic bias of our organization toward white (particularly male) activists. We will do this by building deeper ties with organizations representing poor and working-class women and people of color \u2026\u00a0 We must do so with humility and take our lead from the organizations that organize and are led by poor and working-class people in those communities.\u201d Political experts say the soul searching is somewhat surprising. \u201cThey seem very pragmatic, which to me doesn\u2019t seem very Socialist,\u201d said Daniel Pout, an instructor at Arizona State University\u2019s School of Politics and Global Studies. \u201cThey have to almost be non-socialist in order to be popular.\u201d The DSA\u2019s effort to push their causes through the Democratic political machine has met with success. Ocasio-Cortez has grabbed the headlines and broad media attention, but the DSA claims its candidates have won 22 of some 30 elections they took part in. Whatever the numbers, it\u2019s become trendy for Democratic Party candidates to align themselves with the Democratic Socialists. One of the more prominent examples is Cynthia Nixon, the former \u201cSex and the City\u201d actress who is running against Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the New York Democratic gubernatorial primary. Whatever [political party] ballot line the [socialist] movement chooses to use, we must always be working to increase the independent power of labor and the left. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see that our policies and what we espouse are resonating with people running for governor,\u201d said Abdullah Younous, co-chair of DSA\u2019s New York City chapter,\u00a0to Politico.\u00a0\u201cThe landscape is really shifting, and people are noticing it across the state.\u201d And the Democratic establishment, feeling the pressure to perform well in this year's midterm elections, doesn't seem terribly concerned about the DSA's efforts to push the party even further left. \"The DNC's mission is to elect Democrats from the school board to the oval office, and we welcome the help of all organizations to achieve that goal,\" said Sabrina Singh, deputy communications director for the Democratic National Committee. The DSA declined to comment for this article. That leaves Democratic Socialists in a position to withhold their endorsement if a Democratic candidate isn\u2019t far-left enough, posing a challenge to those who see the group as a vehicle to boost their chances of getting elected. A flyer at a New York City DSA meeting to discuss whether to endorse Nixon was quoted by Politico as saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t just grant endorsements to progressives who beg us for one. We endorse people who can advance the anti-capitalist struggle.\u201d DSA members say Democratic candidates must be willing to embrace policy positions like universal housing and health care, free public college education, shelter and transportation, the abolition of ICE, of the U.S. Senate, of prisons, and an economy where the worker is the priority. The DSA website also calls for everyone to receive a basic income -- whether or not they work. The group has said it wants to move away from the image \u2013 though not all the tenets\u00a0\u2013\u00a0 of Marxist-Leninist principles. It does not want to be seen as a fringe group, so DSA-backed candidates frequently quote names like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Franklin D. Roosevelt, rather than Karl Marx or Vladimir Lenin. Critics say they are determined to hit back at what they depict as a Marxist fox in Democratic sheep\u2019s clothing. A large part of the Democratic Socialists\u2019 growing support comes from younger voters who have no memory of the Cold War, and the more sinister threat and reputation of the Soviet Union and other Socialist states around the world. Sen. Bernie Sanders \u201cThis is the tactic that Communist parties and socialist movements have used all over the world to gain influence in the political world,\u201d said Marion Smith, executive director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit. \u201cWe saw that in Venezuela. They didn\u2019t come to power as Communists, but that is what they were.\u201d Smith said the foundation teaches about authoritarian regimes that started out by downplaying or denying socialist or Communist leanings. \u201cMartin Luther King very explicitly considered viewing the Soviet Union and socialists as allies for civil rights in the U.S.,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut [ultimately] his great speeches, his call for civil rights, were a call for the American people to live up to the principles of the Declaration of Independence. It was an embrace of democratic values, not a rejection of them.\u201d Some Republicans across the country see opportunities to pick up critical swing votes if Democrats lurch too far left before November\u2019s congressional elections. \u201cDemocratic Socialism is a false paradise,\u201d said Marc Molinaro, Dutchess County, N.Y., executive and front-runner for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. \u201cWhat New Yorkers and Americans want is the ability to achieve success. Every American family deserves individual freedom, and the opportunity to achieve real success.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think New Yorkers or Americans want to embrace a party that hands over all aspects of our lives to a government that can barely provide services competently.\u201d Republicans believe they can also capitalize on issues like the Social Democrats\u2019 call to abolish the ICE\u00a0agency, which is picking up more support among more mainstream Democrats. Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan last week introduced legislation to abolish ICE, which led House Speaker Paul Ryan to say Democrats \u201chave really jumped the shark on the left.\u201d Perhaps in response to the hard swing left among many candidates, some Democratic Party leaders asked Socialist candidates to tone down their anti-capitalist, pro-universal public benefits rhetoric. But emboldened Democratic Socialists don\u2019t seem in the mood for compromise. Democratic Socialist candidate Franklin Bynum, who in March won the Democratic nomination to be a Houston criminal court judge, simply refused Democratic Party leaders\u2019 pressure to make his tone more mainstream. Bynum made clear the Democratic Party machine was useful to him, for now, given the limits of what he could achieve on the margins. \u201cIf I have money, I will give them money because I can\u2019t organize a get-out-the-vote campaign by myself,\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cBut I am focused more on building a movement than I am on helping Democrats get elected. My priority is reaching people who aren\u2019t being spoken to at all.\u201d Pout, the Arizona professor, thinks socialists might someday have a chance at building enough support to run candidates of their own, under the Socialist Party banner. \"There\u2019s an attack on the center, in both parties, on business-as-usual,\u201d Pout said. \u201cJeff Flake, in my state, decided not to run again, he sees no way he can fight against this anti-establishment, anti-status-quo\u201d environment.",

Trump says he meant the opposite when he said in Helsinki that he doesn't see why Russia would have interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections..

Developing now, Wednesday, July 18,\u00a02018 THE LEAD STORY - 'I'M NOT PRO-RUSSIA': President Trump denied he was \"pro-Russia\" and slammed former CIA Director John Brennan in a FOX News interview airing Tuesday night, after Brennan described Trump's news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"treasonous\" ...\u00a0\"I think Brennan is a very bad guy and if you look at it a lot of things happened under his watch,\" Trump told Fox News' Tucker Carlson. \"I think he's a very bad person.\" On Monday, Brennan tweeted that Trump's performance at the news conference \"rises to & exceeds the threshold of 'high crimes & misdemeanors.'\" The \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" interview was recorded in Helsinki following the Trump-Putin news conference, at which Trump appeared to dismiss the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. Trump backtracked and attempted to clarify his comments on Tuesday. Earlier Tuesday, Trump said that he misspoke when he seemed to dismiss allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, stating clearly that he accepts the U.S. intelligence community's conclusions as he sought to quell a bipartisan firestorm over his press conference with Vladimir Putin ...\u00a0 \"I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election took place,\" Trump said, adding: \"It could be other people also.\" The president suggested he was surprised by the negative reaction when he returned to Washington. TAX CUTS\u00a02.0: President Trump met with Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday to discuss a possible second phase of tax cuts ...\u00a0The president said late last month during an interview with FOX Business\u2019 Maria Bartiromo that the administration would \u201cbe doing\u201d the new tax package this fall, in October or possibly sooner. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said on Tuesday he expected the House to vote on a bill by September. In the wake of implementation of the tax overhaul, more than 430 companies have announced pay raises, bonuses or 401(k) hikes, benefiting more than 4 million Americans, according to the White House. COMEY CHIMES IN: Former FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday said \u201chistory has its eyes on us\u201d and encouraged Americans to vote for Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections ...\u00a0Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump in May 2017, issued a tweet urging Americans to snub Republicans this November.\u00a0\u201cThis Republican Congress has proven incapable of fulfilling the Founders\u2019 design that \u2018Ambition must \u2026 counteract ambition,\u2019\u201d tweeted the former FBI director, a longtime supporter of Republicans. \u201cAll who believe in this country\u2019s values must vote for Democrats this fall. History has its eyes on us.\u201d FORMER TRUMP CRITIC WINS:\u00a0Voters in Alabama backed four-term Republican incumbent Rep. Martha Roby on Tuesday in a closely watched primary runoff, less than two years after she alienated some constituents by distancing herself from President Trump amid the \"Access Hollywood\" scandal ...\u00a0Though Trump and Vice President Mike Pence endorsed Roby in the race over her Democrat-turned-Republican rival, Bobby Bright, Roby's decision to withdraw her endorsement of Trump just before the 2016 presidential election loomed large on Tuesday with voters in the deep-red state.\u00a0Still, Roby prevailed in the 2nd Congressional District over Bright, a former mayor of Montgomery, owing largely to her support for Trump's agenda and her rival's inconsistent political affiliation. Bright had supported Nancy Pelosi when he served as a Democrat representing the district in Congress. ALL-STAR SLUGFEST: Major League Baseball's Home Run Derby was Monday night, but Tuesday night's All-Star Game seemed like a repeat as the American and National league teams hit multiple round-trippers in the AL's 8-6 extra-inning victory ... The game at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., was the sixth straight win for the American League. Houston's Alex Bregman and George Springer smacked back-to-back shots in the top of the 10th to put the AL in the lead for good. Bregman was named the game's Most Valuable Player.

            "article_content": "GOP candidates tout President Trump's victories while Democratic hopefuls seek to highlight Cabinet scandals; Peter Doocy reports from Capitol Hill. WASHINGTON \u2013 Democrats trying to wrestle control of Congress away from Republicans are deploying an anti-Trump strategy called, \u201cA Better Deal,\u201d which is essentially an anti-Trump, anti-tax reform agenda. \u201cInstead of delivering on its promise to drain the swamp, President Trump has become the swamp,\u201d Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Monday. \u201cRising gas prices will, as one economist put it, roughly cancel out the 2018 consumption boost from tax cuts,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-Calif., said Wednesday. \u201cThe best thing we can do to stop the worst part about the Trump agenda is to win the 2018 elections,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said Thursday. Meredith Kelly, DCCC communications director, joins 'The Story' with insight on the 2018 midterms and analysis of projected outcomes. But there are Democrats running for re-election in states President Trump won easily, so talk like that isn\u2019t tenable for everyone in the party. \u201cIn West Virginia, people like Donald Trump, and they like Joe Manchin,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told Fox News.\u00a0 \u201cAnd you know what, we can work very well together.\u201d Manchin\u2019s campaign has internal polling showing he has an early lead over Republican challenger, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who recently emerged from a bruising primary plagued by personal attacks. So don\u2019t expect to see Manchin, who is seeking a second full term, adopting the midterm strategy touted by Pelosi or Schumer. \u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to adopt a policy up here they think is their winning ticket, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winning ticket for me at all.\u201d Do Trump's tweets impact voters' decisions? Kansas GOP fundraiser shares insight. Republicans candidates hoping to help the party retain or expand its congressional majorities are field-testing messages focused on the benefits of tax reform, a reduction in regulations, and the appointments of conservatives to courtrooms across the country. \u201cIf you look at the Supreme Court nominations, our judges right now are filling the federal courts, making good decisions based on the Constitution, not trying to be activist judges,\u201d Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., told Fox News. Senate hopefuls are also offering themselves as helpful to a president who has struggled at times to convince lawmakers in his own party to align with his policy proposals. \u201cThe president's agenda is to save the middle class and that's what we\u2019re working toward,\u201d Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley told Fox News, about his campaign to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. Hawley, considered a top GOP recruit this cycle, is also borrowing anti-establishment rhetoric reminiscent of President Trump\u2019s, calling McCaskill a member of the \u201cD.C. Cartel,\u201d which has \u201cfeathered its own nest.\u201d Borrowing from President Trump\u2019s 2016 phrase-book has already proven successful for Senate primary winners in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. \u201cThe wall is being built,\u201d Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., said to cheers at his primary night victory speech.\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell is there to be upset about?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Debate over how the president's policies will impact midterm elections. The biggest news story in 2018 is not Omarosa or Stormy Daniels \u2013 it is the booming economy, according to Director of the White House Economic Council Larry Kudlow, who made that case to pals at a recent dinner. He is right, of course. The acceleration in U.S. growth, bringing rising wages and increased job opportunities across the board, is a monumental achievement of the Trump White House. Especially since so many liberal economists, like Larry Summers, said it couldn\u2019t be done. The second biggest news item is that President Trump\u2019s approval ratings have held steady as a rock, especially among Republicans. There is a ferocity among his followers that does not attach in this era to any other political figure, and for that we can credit, at least in part, the media. The worse their attacks on the president become, the more steadfast his support. Go figure. The third biggest story, in my view, is that many GOP candidates appear oblivious to both these themes. Democrats spend more time talking about the economy and the GOP tax cuts than Republicans do; they certainly have more to say about the president. Many Republicans running for office appear embarrassed by the economic power unleashed by lower tax rates and deregulation; it\u2019s almost as though they don\u2019t understand what is happening. At best, they seem unable to articulate why the tax cuts are helping their voters. These reluctant Republicans have allowed Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues to set the narrative about the GOP tax cuts and the buoyant economy. Democrats began lying about the GOP tax bill before it was even written, with Chuck Schumer et al initially saying that it would not benefit middle-class workers. When numerous analyses indicated that claim was flat-out wrong, and as Americans discovered the savings in their paychecks, their tune changed, slightly. Now they stress that the gains are mostly flowing to the wealthy, and to big, fat corporations. They are hoping the politics of envy will override relief that jobs are suddenly plentiful and that consumer optimism is off the charts, for the first time in a decade. Here\u2019s a heads-up: midterm elections are always about turnout. Always. Trump, and Trump alone in many districts, will drive GOP turnout. He is the energy in the party, his is the story \u2013 and he can tell it better than anyone. Do they really think John Kasich boosted Troy Balderson\u2019s vote? A recent story in the New York Times is typical. It says the lower taxes on businesses are \u201cunlocking tens of millions of dollars in campaign donations from the wealthy conservatives and corporate interests that benefitted handsomely from it.\u201d The piece names various people and corporations who have donated to the Congressional Leadership Fund, and hints that Sheldon Adelson, for instance, gave $30 million to the Paul Ryan-linked Super Pac with monies received from the tax reform bill. The Times fails to mention that Adelson has in previous elections topped that figure, and has consistently supported Republicans and Donald Trump. They also neglect to list the billionaires who have given millions to House Majority, the corresponding Democrat Super Pac, like Paloma Partners founder Donald Sussman or Euclidean Capital, the family office of hedge fund wizard James Simon. Were their donations a direct result of the GOP tax cuts, too? The Times piece quotes Corry Bliss, the head of the Super PAC working to hold onto the GOP majority in Congress, saying he had \u201call but begged every campaign to run on the middle-class tax cut,\u201d to no avail. He says, \u201cIn this environment, if you don\u2019t make clear the contrasts between the two teams, then you are not going to get the benefit of the doubt.\u201d He notes that two incumbent Republicans running in contested districts carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2013 Carlos Curbelo in Florida and Will Hurd in Texas \u2013 are running better than expected by doing just that. For the past year, Democrats have hoped that anti-Trump sentiment would translate to a Blue Wave, giving them the 24 seats needed to flip control of the House of Representatives and maybe even gaining an advantage in the Senate. They have clung to a couple of special election outcomes, mainly Conor Lamb\u2019s win in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District and more recently the tight race in Ohio\u2019s 12th, to bolster their hopes. They can also cite history; almost always the party in the White House leaks power in the midterms. But Trump continues to turn convention on its head. The recent Ohio race was close, but \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 the president\u2019s last-minute rally for Republican Troy Balderson appears to have pushed him over the edge. (The official tally drags on.) Before voting day, internal GOP polling showed Balderson trailing rival Danny O\u2019Connor. Party officials had written off the seat. Republican candidates and strategists anguish over President Trump\u2019s popularity and dither over whether to back him. Here\u2019s a heads-up: midterm elections are always about turnout. Always. Trump, and Trump alone in many districts, will drive GOP turnout. He is the energy in the party, his is the story \u2013 and he can tell it better than anyone. Do they really think John Kasich boosted Troy Balderson\u2019s vote? Democrats are counting on anti-Trump fever to drive their voters to the polls. Since the party has yet to present a platform that excites Americans, they are relying on their constituents to vote against Donald Trump. For many, that will be enough. But it is a risky strategy, especially since a number of Democrats\u2019 core constituents appear tilting ever so slightly in Trump\u2019s direction. African-American support for the president has increased, according to a variety of polls, as has his approval ratings among Hispanics. Both those groups, most likely, appreciate the better job opportunities they see, and their rising wages. President Trump will doubtless campaign relentlessly between now and November, and candidates would do well to ask for his support. They would also be well advised to talk up the economy. \u00a0That is indeed the biggest story of the year, for all Americans.",

Rep. Joe Crowley, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus who was thought by some to be a future Speaker of the House, suffered a shocking primary defeat in New York's 14th House District Tuesday. With 88 percent of precincts reporting, 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- who has never held elected office -- led Crowley by more than 3,600 votes. Ocasio-Cortez, a Bernie Sanders supporter who has called for the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), had gained the endorsement of several left-wing groups, including MoveOn and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). \"We have built power. We have organized,\" Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter as the polls closed. \"What we have built is permanent. No. Matter. What.\" OCASIO-CORTEZ ATTACKS ICE AS A 'DANGEROUS AGENCY' Soon after The Associated Press called the race, the New York City branch of the DSA tweeted congratulations to Ocasio-Cortez, saying that her victory proved \"that working class people are hungry for a voice in politics.\" In a statement, Crowley congratulated Ocasio-Cortez on her victory and said he looked forward to supporting her against Republican Anthony Pappas in November. \"The Trump administration is a threat to everything we stand for here in Queens and the Bronx, and if we don't win back the House this November, we will lose the nation we love,\" Crowley said. \"This is why we must come together. We will only be able to stop Donald Trump and the Republican Congress by working together, as a united Democratic Party.\" The National Republican Campaign Committee celebrated the defeat of \"poor Joe Crowley.\" \"House Democrats, hoping for a post-Pelsoi era, are now left leaderless,\" NRCC spokesman Matt Gorman said. \"The only person happier tonight than Nancy Pelosi is the NRCC.\" CROWLEY JOINS TOP LOBBYING FIRM AFTER PRIMARY DEFEAT President Trump also reveled in the downfall of the man he called \"Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley\" \"That is a big one that nobody saw happening,\" Trump said of Crowley's defeat. \"Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!\" Crowley, the fourth-ranked House Democrat and a ten-term incumbent, was viewed by many observers as the one person a broad enough support base to potentially succeed House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi or House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer. His defeat leaves a large gap in the House Democratic leadership and ensures that Pelosi and Hoyer will be able to remain in their posts, if they choose to do so. In a statement, Pelosi described Crowley as \"an unwavering champion for America\u2019s working families for almost two decades\" who \"brought principled, unifying and forward-looking leadership to the historic challenges of the Trump Administration\" as the Democratic caucus chair. \"I salute Chairman Crowley for a formidable legacy of achievement for the people of New York,\" Pelosi concluded. \"I congratulate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on her victory.\" Fox News' Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Poll shows Dems riled - Trump to boost struggling Iowa GOP with more ethanol - Florida Dems want registration delay for hurricane - O-tis! O-tis! O-tis!HALEY\u2019S SURPRISE KICKS OFF CABINET SPECULATIONWe don\u2019t know if whether we\u2019ll have to wait for the next Bob Woodward book to figure out why in the heck one of the best liked and most successful members of President Trump\u2019s cabinet chose a random Tuesday, four weeks before a crucial midterm election to announce her departure.\nThe backstory here may be intriguing or just plain dull \u2013 It was about to leak and the administration wanted to get ahead of the story, the door was closing on the cabinet member\u2019s next opportunity, etc. But whatever the reason, the announced departure of Nikki Haley as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations has got everybody talking.\nThat\u2019s partly because Haley is a star player for the GOP. It\u2019s hard to imagine how anyone could go from vehement opposition to Trump\u2019s candidacy in the 2016 primaries to the gushy sendoff Haley got Tuesday from the president, and that alone is testament of her political skills. And the timing is so weird. The announcement stepped on the ongoing coverage of the president\u2019s successful Supreme Court nomination and other recent successes for the administration. The backstory had better be pretty important to merit a move like this one. And with the president saying he will make a pick for her replacement before voters go to the polls, there\u2019s another disruption ahead.\nBut the other reason Haley\u2019s early arrival in the departure lounge has generated so much attention is that it has forced people to think about other big changes ahead for Trump\u2019s cabinet after Election Day. In a new administration there are a couple of decorous times to exit. The first is after one year but before midterm\u2019s heat up, while the other is during the lame-duck period after the primaries.\nWe expect Haley will hardly be alone in her December farewell. But who else?\nThe biggie here is Defense Secretary James Mattis, and to a lesser degree White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.\nOn the one hand it\u2019s hard to imagine Mattis persisting in a post so grueling for a commander in chief who is pretty much his polar opposite. On the other hand, this is a guy who led the first Marine division in Fallujah, so maybe his definition of hardship duty is different than most.\nMattis\u2019 departure would be a monumental change for an administration that had relied on \u201cChaos\u201d to keep order in the Republican ranks in Congress. As long as Mattis has kept his cool and Trump has referred to the retired general, lawmakers have breathed easier. Finding a replacement would not be so easy.\nKelly has filled a somewhat similar role in ensuring congressional leaders that good practices are being followed and that the mercurial president has a sobersided voice in his inner circle. But given the degree to which Trump has diminished Kelly and without the need for a confirmation vote, a change there would be less fraught.\nThen there\u2019s Jeff Sessions. Poor Jeff Sessions.\nSessions has been an invaluable asset to Trump in a couple of ways. Aside from executing top priorities for the administration on immigration, drugs and more, the former Alabama senator has made a convenient punching bag for the president to vent his anger over Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian efforts to aid Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\nGiven what would happen if Trump actually fired Sessions and how difficult confirming a replacement would have been under the circumstances, Sessions\u2019 willingness to accept the indignity of working for Trump has been quite helpful.\nWhile Sessions seems determined not to quit, his fate substantially depends on how Republicans do in Senate races next month. If Republicans gain seats, making confirmation fights easier, Trump would have a freer hand to move against his top cop. Conversely, if Republicans maintain their narrow majority or lose ground, Sessions\u2019 hand will be strengthened. THE RULEBOOK: IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BE BETTER\u00a0\u201cIf the nation happens, on any emergency, to be more united by the necessity of self-defense, its situation is still deplorable.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton\u00a0and\u00a0James Madison, Federalist No. 19TIME OUT:\u00a0THEY\u2019RE GOOD DOGS, CLIVE\u00a0\u00a0The Atlantic:\u00a0\u201c\u2018All puppies are cute,\u2019 explains\u00a0Clive Wynne, the head of Arizona State University\u2019s canine-science laboratory. \u2018But not all puppies are equally cute.\u2019 Indeed, breeders have long found that puppies become their cutest selves at the eight-week mark; any older, and some breeders offer a discount to bolster would-be owners\u2019 weakened desire. Such fine-tuned preferences might seem arbitrary, even cruel. But recent research indicates that peak puppy cuteness serves important purposes\u2014and might play a fundamental role in binding dog and owner together. In a study published this spring, Wynne and his colleagues sought to pin down, scientifically, the timeline of puppy cuteness. Their finding largely matched that of breeders: People consistently rated dogs most attractive when they were six to eight weeks old. This age, Wynne says, coincides with a crucial developmental milestone: Mother dogs stop nursing their young around the eighth week, after which pups rely on humans for survival. \u2026 Peak cuteness, then, is no accident\u2014at exactly the moment when our intervention matters most, puppies become irresistible to us.\u201dFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with\nyour tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDTrump job performance\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a042 percentAverage disapproval:\u00a053 percentNet Score:\u00a0-11 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0down 1.6 points\u00a0\n[Average includes: CNN: 43% approve - 52% disapprove; Gallup: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; IBD: 40% approve - 54% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 53% disapprove.]Control of House\nRepublican average:\u00a042 percentDemocratic average:\u00a049.6 percentAdvantage:\u00a0Democrats plus 7.6 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0Democratic advantage down 0.6 points\u00a0\n[Average includes: CNN: 54% Dems - 41% GOP; IBD: 45% Dems - 43% GOP; NPR/PBS/Marist: 48% Dems - 42% GOP; Quinnipiac University: 49% Dems - 42% GOP; Pew Research Center: 52% Dems - 42% GOP.]BACKLASH TO A BACKLASH? POLL SHOWS DEMS RILEDCNN:\u00a0\u201cFour weeks out from Election Day, Democrats remain well ahead of Republicans in a generic ballot matchup, with 54% of likely voters saying they support the Democrat in their district and 41% backing a Republican, according to a\u00a0CNN poll conducted by SSRS. This is the widest margin of support for Democrats in a midterm cycle since 2006, when at this point, the party held a whopping 21-point lead over Republicans among likely voters. \u2026\u00a0This year, Democrats' enthusiasm about their congressional vote has increased and 62% now say they're extremely or very enthusiastic to vote, up seven points since September among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Among Republicans and Republican leaning independents, enthusiasm has remained relatively steady, going from 50% in September to 52% in the most recent poll.\u201dGreatest intensity among anti-Kavanaugh voters -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cA NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist survey released last week\u00a0indicated\u00a0that [Mitch McConnell\u2019s] excitement might be warranted: After trailing Democrats in enthusiasm during the summer, Republican enthusiasm for voting has caught up. But that is only half the picture. More important is how those energized voters plan to cast their ballots \u2014 and a new CNN-SSRS\u00a0poll\u00a0suggests that the most enthusiastic voters are not those Americans most interested in rising to [Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s] defense. Consider, for example, the responses to questions about how President Trump\u2019s doing in his job or whether Kavanaugh should have been confirmed. Disapproval of Trump is higher among those who are more enthusiastic to vote, as is opposition to Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\u201dTRUMP TO BOOST STRUGGLING IOWA GOP WITH MORE ETHANOLCNBC: \u201cWith his latest energy policy move, President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0aims in part to boost Iowa Republicans fighting to hold critical offices next month. On Tuesday afternoon, the president is\u00a0expected to order his administration to end a summertime ban on sales of E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline. Iowa corn growers and the politicians who represent them have pushed for the change, arguing it will stabilize the state's farm industry amid trade uncertainty. Trump's change could help the two vulnerable Iowa Republicans expected to join him at a Tuesday night rally: Rep.\u00a0David Young\u00a0and Gov.\u00a0Kim Reynolds. The ethanol action could also aid Rep.\u00a0Rod Blum, one of the House incumbents considered most likely to lose a seat in this year's midterm elections.\u201dDonnelly touts centrism despite \u2018no\u2019 vote on Kavanaugh -\u00a0AP:\u00a0\u201cDemocratic Indiana Sen.\u00a0Joe Donnelly\u00a0and Republican businessman\u00a0Mike Braun\u00a0don\u2019t agree on much. But both conceded one point Monday night, during their first debate: they support President Donald Trump. \u2018I go against my party all the time,\u2019 Donnelly said from the debate state in Westville. \u2026 Unlike many Democratic campaigns across the U.S. that have been galvanized by Trump opposition, Donnelly touted his support for Trump\u2019s priorities. \u2026 But Donnelly has cast several high-profile votes against Trump and in line with Democrats, including his \u2018no\u2019 vote this weekend on Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh and the GOP led tax cut bill. That gave Braun an opening to attack. \u2026 Donnelly entered the debate wanting to sow doubts about Braun\u2019s trustworthiness, while raising concern that, as a Republican, he would try to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which is sometimes referred to as \u2018Obamacare.\u2019\u201dOhio House grudge match no nicer the second time -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cHistory is filled with great rematches. \u2026 Now, there's\u00a0Troy Balderson\u00a0against\u00a0Danny O\u2019Connor. Perhaps it doesn't stack up against those other grudge matches, but the rematch between these rivals for a fiercely contested Ohio House seat is one of the hottest tickets in November's midterm elections. The two political pugilists went head-to-head back in August for a special election, with Republican Balderson narrowly defeating Democrat O\u2019Connor to finish the term of former GOP Rep.\u00a0Pat Tiberi\u00a0in Ohio\u2019s 12th Congressional District. The race took nearly three weeks to call and ultimately was decided by a margin of less than 1 percent. But with Tiberi\u2019s original term ending in January, the newly sworn-in Rep. Balderson must once again face O\u2019Connor for control of the 12th District seat.\u201dOregon governor can\u2019t quite shake GOP challenger -\u00a0KGW8:\u00a0\u201cWith one week to go before ballots get sent to most Oregon voters, the governor\u2019s race appears to be a close contest between Democratic incumbent Gov.\u00a0Kate Brown\u00a0and her challenger, Republican lawmaker\u00a0Knute Buehler. A new poll shows Brown with a slight lead over Buehler, 49 to 45 percent, with other candidates dividing up the remainder. The poll was conducted between Sept. 24 and Oct. 7 here by Riley Research Associates for KGW Media Group and The Oregonian/OregonLive. The two Portland media organizations are sponsoring a debate between the two gubernatorial candidates on Tuesday, Oct. 9, at KGW\u2019s studios. The debate will air at 7 p.m. on KGW-TV Channel 8, and live-streamed to digital audiences at KGW.com, KGW\u2019s Facebook and Twitter pages, and the KGW News app.\u201dFLORIDA DEMS WANT REGISTRATION DELAY FOR HURRICANEAP: \u201cA partisan brushfire blew up Tuesday amid the threat of Hurricane Michael over voter registration deadlines in the battleground state of Florida. The Florida Democratic Party sued in federal court on Tuesday, asking a judge to extend the state's registration deadline by at least a week. Florida's deadline to register to vote is Tuesday, 29 days ahead of the Nov. 6 election. \u2026\u00a0Shortly before midnight on Monday, Florida Secretary of State\u00a0Ken Detzner, who works for Republican Gov.\u00a0Rick Scott, told local election supervisors that if their offices were closed on Tuesday, then they could accept paper applications on the day their offices reopen. \u2026 Democrats are contending in their lawsuit that Detzner's solution is inadequate and not equally available to all Floridians. The lawsuit asks what happens to people who evacuate and can't make it back to their local elections offices on the day they reopen.\u201dRegistration closes today in key battlegrounds -\u00a0ABC News: \u201cThere are 18 states with midterm registration deadlines Tuesday, including states that could prove pivotal in the midterms.

The packed October schedule marks the Vermont independent\u2019s most extensive stretch of campaigning since the 2016 presidential race. It will include stops in Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada, home to crucial early contests on the 2020 primary calendar. Sanders is expected to make a decision on whether to launch another campaign in the coming months and the tour could inform his decision. It will allow him to test the durability of the left-leaning coalition he assembled in 2016 and build relationships with elected officials who could serve as allies should he run again. \u2018He wanted to go where he thinks he can be helpful in energizing the base and bringing in young people and independent voters and working-class voters who supported him,\u2019 said\u00a0Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign manager and longtime political adviser.\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYDemocratic staffer accused of doxxing GOP senators denied bail - Fox NewsCuomo v.

About 135 million people voted in 2016. There were another 90 million or so who were eligible but who did not vote. So at first blush, as one out of a universe of 225 million potential survey participants is considerably worse than your chances of being struck by lightning in a given year (1 in 700,000) or being in a plane crash (1 in 5.4 million). But your odds are even longer than some Americans\u2019, Mr. Green. Living in Texas and in what had been for decades until this cycle a reliably Republican House district, you have not had the probability boosts that your fellow citizens in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania or other swing states have experienced. If you lived in a swing district in a swing state, your chances would be considerably higher, but even then, still low.

Va. \u2013 West Virginia seemed quite unnecessary to Democrats a decade ago.  With just five electoral votes, an aging, stagnant population and little in the way of economic dynamism, the Mountain State was a political irrelevancy.  With the second oldest, twelfth whitest and third poorest population in the union, West Virginia doesn\u2019t fit any of the talking points about the once-vaunted \u201cemerging Democratic majority.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Democrats have been focused on the expected blue wave for this fall, but that\u2019s just part of a larger wishing, waiting and hoping that the party has been engaged in since about 2004.  The central conceit of Democratic strategy for more than a decade is that a coming tsunami of younger, more diverse and more affluent voters will transform the political map and make irrelevant the old, white, middle-class coalition that has been deciding elections since before Dwight Eisenhower ever hit a chip shot.  They\u2019re not wrong. But they are early. As we have talked about many times, the demographic changes taking place among Americans age 30 and under are breathtaking.  That may be for reasons that have as much to do with dissatisfaction with a highly commercialized version of the American Dream as it does with demography. The post-WWII trend of voters moving from left to right ideologically as they move from city to suburb residentially is probably not going to hold. Young adults are waiting longer to marry, waiting longer to have children and shunning the suburban sameness to which their parents and grandparents flocked. But the ethnic demographics are a doozy, too. In 2015, for the first time in history, the majority of babies born in the United States were not white. Anyone who thinks that the transition from a white majority to a minority majority will be gradual is going to be in for a rude awakening.  After their defeat in 2004, though, Democrats over-interpreted these data to console themselves for a heartbreaking presidential loss. It didn\u2019t matter, they said, because the coming change would obliterate the Republican coalition that the GOP had gotten increasingly good at maximizing. The election of an African-American Hawaiian with the middle name Hussein four years later richly confirmed these assumptions.  As much as Democrats were appalled by Donald Trump\u2019s victory in spite of his boorishness, cruelty and casual dishonesty, they were even more shocked that demographic determinism had failed them.  How could states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan with substantial African American populations join the ranks of lily-white spots like West Virginia? This is not what was promised.  There\u2019s a couple of ways you can look at this, and both hold substantial truth.  On the one hand, we are witnessing a troubling ethnic balkanization in American politics. White voters are engaging in identity politics in unbecoming ways. You may think that they have every right to act like other racial groups have, if you see white victimhood as a concerning trend. But whether they are entitled to it or not, the increasing tribalism in the white majority means deepening disunion and racial hostility.  On the other hand, though, we are witnessing the benefits of having a federal republic. Because our country is organized into 50 states changes in political direction come harder than in unitary systems.  And there is much more at work here than just questions of racial identity. Culture, economics and policies matter bigly as well.  Working-class white voters responded in the only logical way when Democrats started shunning them after the 2004 election. The Clinton-era coalition was able to accommodate white and minority voters in states as different as West Virginia and California. The Democratic base had long been annoyed by having to accommodate Rust Belt and Appalachian voters, particularly on culture and environmental issues.  Once they embraced the dogma of demographic determinism, though, Democrats could simply write off a sizable chunk of their coalition, confident in the belief that a rising tide of liberal, young, minority voters would give the party both power and ideological purity. The results of the experiment are in and it has been a catastrophe for the Blue Team. Democrats should have looked more closely at West Virginia because Democrats would have seen the peril ahead. George W. Bush narrowly won the state in 2000, becoming the first Republican non-incumbent to do so since Herbert Hoover in 1928. Democrats would contest the state in the next cycle but end up with a more decisive defeat. By 2008 Democrats had written off the Mountain State entirely. By 2016, it was the second-most Republican state in the union. West Virginia\u2019s shift was not like that of southern states that flipped like switches following the Democratic embrace of civil rights in 1964 and thereafter, even if Democrats treated it as such.  The truth was that West Virginia was a cautionary tale for Democrats about working class and poor white voters that presaged the coming loss of the House of Representatives and wipeout in statehouses across the country.  As it turns out, there is quite a bit of West Virginia in a lot of states, particularly in the Upper Midwest.  This new disdain for Democrats among blue-collar voters has bought Republicans precious time to try to prepare for the demographic shifts ahead. They are certainly not making much of the opportunity in regards to building for the future.  But even so, Democrats should worry that by the time the tsunami arrives they will be too weak and too beholden to special interest groups within their base to successfully surf the wave.

Currently held in the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History in Washington D.C., the flag is making a trek back across the Atlantic to where it was put together, the Scottish island of Islay. It was used in funerals for the more than 200 American soldiers who drowned when the SS Tuscania was hit with a torpedo by a German U-boat. The ship departed Hoboken, N.J. on Jan. 24 1918, with 384 crewmen and more than 2,000 U.S. Army personnel and was headed for Liverpool. The German U-boat, UB-77, eventually sank the Tuscania on Feb. 5, 2018 when it fired two torpedoes at the ship, causing it to sink in about four hours.\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us atHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD Trump job performance\u00a0 Average approval:\u00a041.8 percent\u00a0Average disapproval:\u00a052.4 percent\u00a0 Net Score:\u00a0-10.6 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0up 4 points\u00a0 [Average includes: Monmouth University: 45% approve - 48% disapprove; Gallup: 42% approve - 53% disapprove; Fox News: 44% approve - 53% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 39% approve - 54% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 39% approve - 54% disapprove.]Control of HouseRepublican average:\u00a041.2 percentDemocratic average:\u00a047.2 percentAdvantage:\u00a0Democrats plus 6 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0Democratic advantage\u00a0up one point [Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 48% Dems - 40% GOP; NPR/PBS/Marist: 44% Dems - 39% GOP; ABC News/WaPo: 47% Dems - 43% GOP; NBC News/WSJ: 47% Dems - 40% GOP; CNN: 50% Dems - 44% GOP.] BLANKENSHIP BENEFITS AS FOES FIGHT West Virginia MetroNews: \u201cFox News Political Editor Chris Stirewalt believes former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship may have picked up as many as eight percentage points for his performance in Tuesday night\u2019s debate. Blankenship, who debated on Fox News with state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Third District Congressman Evan Jenkins, was able to mostly avoid how he is usually described, Stirewalt said. \u2018You\u2019re the killer. You\u2019re a monster. You\u2019re Beelzebub yourself\u2014and he got on stage and he was affable and funny. So he is going to pick back up some of his support out of that,\u2019 Stirewalt said during a Wednesday appearance on MetroNews \u2018Talkline.\u2019 \u2026 West Virginia Wesleyan Political Science Professor Robert Rupp said Blankenship went into the debate with a huge liability but only one question addressed his federal prison time and the 2010 explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine that killed 29 coal miners.\u201dTrump super PAC punishes Tester over VA debacle - Politico: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s political operation is intensifying its offensive against Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), launching a new TV ad labeling him \u2018disgraceful\u2019 and \u2018dishonest\u2019 for his role in taking down a Trump Cabinet pick. \u2018In Montana, we value integrity and support our president,\u2019 says the\u00a0ad\u00a0from the pro-Trump America First Action super PAC. \u2018But Jon Tester spread false information about a respected Navy admiral, helping D.C. Democrats derail President Trump\u2019s Veterans Affairs nominee.\u2019 The spot goes on to say that Tester, one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents up for reelection in 2018, \u2018betrayed our trust, our veterans and our president,\u2019 concluding that \u2018it\u2019s time for him to go.\u2019\u201d O'Rourke trolls Cruz in Espa\u00f1ol - Texas Tribune: \u201cU.S. Rep.\u00a0Beto O'Rourke, D-El Paso, has invited U.S. Sen.\u00a0Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to participate in six debates with O'Rourke across Texas, two of them in Spanish, during their U.S. Senate race. O'Rourke campaign manager Jody Casey made the proposal in a letter last week to Cruz's senior staff, adding that the debates should have \u2018media reach to all twenty markets in the state.\u2019 \u2018I would like to begin direct coordination of the debates with your campaign team between now and May 10th,\u2019 Casey wrote to Cruz advisers Bryan English and Eric Hollander in the April 24 letter. \u2018Please advise my best point of contact on the Cruz campaign team.\u2019 Cruz previously suggested he is open to debating O'Rourke. Cruz's campaign said in response to the letter that it was exploring its options.\u201d House GOP primaries feel the Trump effect - Politico: \u201cFor years, opposing President Barack Obama was among the top issues in Republican primaries. Now, the contests hinge on supporting \u2014 or opposing \u2014 President Donald Trump. In California, a Republican opponent of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher is calling him a \u2018hypocrite\u2019 on supporting Trump, as a super PAC runs digital ads using an old tape of Rohrabacher calling Trump \u2018a mean nasty SOB.\u2019 A Texas Republican in a runoff for an open, GOP-heavy seat is citing his opponent\u2019s old Facebook posts criticizing Trump. And in Indiana, Republican front-runner Mike Braun has given Rep.

Doug Lamborn will get another chance at re-election after a federal judge ruled Tuesday that the six-term lawmaker should be put back on the ballot \u2014 a turnabout from a Colorado Supreme Court decision last week. U.S. District Court Judge Philip Brimmer\u2019s ruling all but ensures that\u00a0Lamborn, R-Colorado Springs, will be able to defend his Republican-leaning seat against GOP rivals Owen Hill, a state senator, and Darryl Glenn, an El Paso County commissioner, in the June 26 primary.\u201dHe\u2019s back: Grayson seeks return to House - Orlando Sentinel: \u201cLiberal firebrand Alan Grayson is back, revealing Tuesday he will challenge U.S. Rep. Darren Soto for his old Central Florida seat in Congress in what likely will be a heated Democratic primary. Grayson had been considering a number of congressional seats to seek, but he told the Orlando Sentinel he chose District 9 in Osceola, Orange and Polk counties that he represented for four years because \u2018that\u2019s where people want me.\u2019 \u2026 The race pits Grayson, who garnered both controversy and a national profile in his six years in Congress, against Soto \u2014 who, as the first Florida congressman of Puerto Rican descent, has been a vocal advocate for the community in the wake of Hurricane Maria and the influx of evacuees to Central Florida. TRUMP SWITCHES LAWYERS \u00a0Fox News: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s in-house lawyer representing him in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe is set to leave this month -- and will be replaced by an attorney who represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment fight, Fox News has learned. [Ty Cobb], who sports a trademark mustache, served as the president\u2019s internal legal counsel and acted as a liaison between the White House and Mueller\u2019s office. White House Counsel Don McGahn advises Trump internally on separate matters. Cobb will now be replaced by Emmet Flood, who served as counsel for Clinton during impeachment proceedings in 1996. Flood also was the lead lawyer at the White House Counsel\u2019s Office during former President George W. Bush\u2019s second term. \u2018For several weeks Ty Cobb has been discussing his retirement and last week he let Chief of Staff [John Kelly] know he would retire at the end of this month,\u2019 White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Wednesday.\u201d Mueller may subpoena Trump if president won\u2019t cooperate - Fox News: \u201cSpecial counsel Robert Mueller told President Trump's legal team that he could subpoena the president to appear before a grand jury if Trump refuses an interview with Mueller's team, Trump's former lead attorney told The Associated Press Tuesday night. John Dowd told the AP that Mueller raised the possibility of a subpoena during a meeting with Trump's legal team in March. According to accounts of the meeting first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed by Fox News, Dowd retorted: \u2018This isn\u2019t some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.\u2019 Dowd resigned as Trump's lead lawyer weeks later amid a dispute over how to answer Mueller's request for a presidential interview.Ex-Trump campaign aide interviewed by Senate panel on Russia - Fox News: \u201cFormer Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo was interviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee Monday as part of the panel's investigation into Russian activities during the 2016 elections. Caputo's lawyer, Dennis Vacco, told Fox News the interview lasted three hours and included opening and closing statements by his client. \u2018The focus [of the interview] was more about his knowledge or lack thereof of Russians, [former Trump campaign manager Paul] Manafort and Manafort associates like [Rick] Gates during the campaign or prior thereto,\u2019 Vacco said.\u201d PLAY-BY-PLAYTrump will meet with former Rep.

            "article_content": "FILE - In this May 23, 2018 file photo, Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, leaves the Federal District Court after a hearing, in Washington. Manafort is scheduled to go to trial Tuesday, July 31 in Alexandria, Virginia, on charges relating to money laundering stemming from a Ukrainian political consulting, giving the public its most detailed glimpse of evidence gathered by special prosecutor Robert Mueller. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) Welcome to FOX News First. Not signed up yet?\u00a0Click\u00a0here. Developing now, Tuesday, July 31,\u00a02018 THE LEAD STORY - MANAFORT - AND THE MUELLER PROBE - ON TRIAL:\u00a0A Mercedes-Benz and multiple Range Rovers. A $3 million brownstone in Brooklyn, bought with cash.\u00a0Those lavish expenditures are now evidence in the high-stakes bank and tax fraud trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, which is set to begin with jury selection Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ...\u00a0The trial is the first arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. It represents a major test not just for Manafort, who faces decades in prison on bank and tax fraud charges if convicted, but also for Mueller, whose ongoing probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election could lose credibility if jurors ultimately acquit Manafort. President Trump repeatedly has called the Mueller probe a \"witch hunt,\" and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has suggested the investigation is \"rigged.\"\u00a0Neither the Virginia trial nor Manafort's separate upcoming trial in Washington, D.C., directly relates to any alleged collusion between Trump officials and the Russian government, or purported Russian disinformation campaigns -- a fact that led to a tense courtroom showdown just months ago. PROSPECTS OF TRUMP-MUELLER INTERVIEW APPEAR SLIM:\u00a0President Trump's legal team is becoming more and more convinced it should ignore questions by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani told FOX News' \"Hannity\" on Monday, saying it's \"highly unlikely\" they\u00a0will meet again with prosecutors ...\u00a0\"Given the revelations of the last three or four weeks, we've gone further away from the idea of answering any questions from them,\" Giuliani told Sean Hannity. \"We don't think they have a legitimate investigation.\u201d Giuliani's comments underscored the newly combative tenor of Trump's camp towards Mueller as Manafort's trial approached. The former New York City mayor, who previously claimed Mueller's team may have been trying to \"frame\" Trump, also laughed off a New York Times report that prosecutors were looking at Trump's tweets to build an obstruction-of-justice case against the president. IRANIAN SUMMIT IN THE WORKS? -\u00a0President Trump said Monday he would be willing to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani with \u201cno preconditions,\u201d on the heels of a fiery exchange of threats earlier this month ...\u00a0\u201cI would certainly meet with Iran if they wanted to meet. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re ready yet,\u201d Trump said, when asked at a White House press conference about a possible meeting with Rouhani.\u00a0Trump said he would set \u201cno preconditions,\u201d and, \u201cIf they want to meet, I\u2019ll meet, anytime they want.\u201d\u00a0The president already has held summits with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un. GOLDEN STATE ON FIRE:\u00a0A pair of wildfires that prompted evacuation orders for nearly 20,000 people barreled Monday toward small lake towns in Northern California as firefighters worked to contain multiple other blazes across the state ... Officials\u00a0on Sunday ordered evacuations around twin fires in Mendocino and Lake counties, including from the 4,700-resident town of Lakeport, a popular destination for bass anglers and boaters on the shores of Clear Lake, about 120 miles north of San Francisco. The blazes have destroyed seven homes and threaten 10,000 others. So far, the flames have blackened more than 68,000 acres \u2014 well over 100 square miles \u2014 with minimal containment. Those fires were among 17 burning across the state, where fire crews were stretched to the limit.\u00a0 Farther north, the wildfire in Redding, Calif. blaze is now believed to be the ninth most destructive in state history, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean said.\u00a0The blaze, which killed two firefighters and four civilians including two children, has now destroyed 818 homes and 311 outbuildings and damaged 165 homes, McLean said.\u00a0More than 27,000 people remained evacuated from their homes although another 10,000 were allowed to return Monday as fire crews reinforced lines on the western end of the blaze. CBS IN CRISIS:\u00a0CBS didn\u2019t take immediate action regarding CEO Les Moonves amid accusations by multiple women of sexual harassment after board members gathered Monday to discuss the situation ...\u00a0\"CBS Corporation announced today that its Board of Directors is in the process of selecting outside counsel to conduct an independent investigation. No other action was taken on this matter at today\u2019s board meeting,\" the company said in an statement. The board met on Monday after a bombshell Ronan Farrow article in The New Yorker was published last week in which six women accused the longtime network exec of sexual harassment. In addition, more than two dozen company employees, past and present, detailed incidents involving harassment, gender discrimination or retaliation at the network between the 1980s and 2000s.

            "article_content": "On a busy night of elections, voting took place in Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, New Jersey, South Dakota, Iowa and Montana. Here\u2019s a look at some of the biggest takeaways. From women hoping to make history to a recall vote for a California judge who issued a controversial sentence to a college student convicted of sexual assault,\u00a0June 5 was a busy night of primary elections nationwide. Primaries were held in eight states: Alabama, California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. President Trump took to Twitter Wednesday morning to praise Republicans and John Cox, the GOP gubernatorial candidate in California who secured enough votes to make it to the general election in November. \u201cGreat night for Republicans! Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California. He can win,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo much for the big Blue Wave, it may be a big Red Wave. Working hard!\u201d Read on for a look at nine primary moments you should know about. Republican John Cox, who has the support of President Trump,\u00a0will appear on the ballot against Democrat Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom later this year. Cox received about a quarter of the votes counted so far, easily outpacing former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for the second-place finish. Newsom came in first by a comfortable margin. Cox, 62, earned his wealth as a lawyer, accountant and investor in the Chicago area. He also owns thousands of apartments in the Midwest. Newsom, 50, is the former mayor of San Francisco. Trump encouraged California voters to support Cox in the primary with multiple tweets, calling the businessman a \u201creally good and highly competent man.\u201d On the morning of the primary, Trump said Cox \u201cwill make a BIG difference\u201d in California, which he called a \u201chigh tax, high crime\u201d state. Republican Rep. Martha Roby, who criticized rescinded her endorsement of President Trump in 2016, failed to secure enough votes in Alabama's primary to avoid a runoff next month. (U.S. House of Representatives) Rep. Martha Roby, R-Ala., retracted her endorsement of Trump -- before he was elected president -- after an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape of Trump saying vulgar things about women was published. Nearly two years later, her seat is in danger. Roby failed to reach the 50 percent threshold in Alabama\u2019s primary and will face Bobby Bright in a July 17 runoff. Bright is the former mayor of Montgomery, Ala., and only recently switched his party affiliation from Democrat. He used to represent the district in Congress until Roby defeated him in 2010. FOX NEWS\u2019 FULL MIDTERM COVERAGE Roby, 41, has represented Alabama\u2019s 2nd congressional district since 2011. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s behavior makes him unacceptable as a candidate for president, and I won\u2019t vote for him,\u201d Roby said at the time, adding, \u201cHillary Clinton must not be president, but, with Trump leading the ticket, she will be.\u201d Her lack of support for Trump has made her a target in the midterm elections. Bright even released a campaign ad in which he accused her of having turned \u201cher back on President Trump when he needed her the most.\u201d Democrat Tabitha Isner won the Democratic primary and will face either Bright or Roby in the general election. Rep. Kristi Noem won the Republican primary for Iowa governor. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Several women secured their party\u2019s nomination for governor in the primaries. Rep. Kristi Noem defeated Attorney General Marty Jackley to become the Republican nominee for South Dakota\u2019s gubernatorial race. She is the only woman South Dakota Republicans have nominated for the state\u2019s top job. Noem, 46, is expected to face Billie Sutton, a well-funded Democrat and former professional rodeo cowboy who ran unopposed, in the general election. In New Mexico, Democrats elected Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, 58, as the party\u2019s nominee for governor. She will face Rep. Steve Pearce, a Republican, in the general election to replace term-limited Gov. Susana Martinez. Democrats already control much of New Mexico politics, including the legislature and other statewide offices. A win for Lujan Grisham, who leads the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and has been an ardent critic of Trump, could shut out Republicans from redistricting efforts in 2021. Incumbent Gov. Kay Ivey, a 73-year-old Republican, won the GOP primary in Alabama. She will face off against Walt Maddox, a Democrat, in the general. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to the people of Alabama for their support throughout this journey, and I am honored to be chosen as the Republican nominee for Governor,\u201d Ivey, who became Alabama\u2019s second female governor in 2017 after Robert Bentley resigned, said in a statement to WBRC-TV. \u201cI humbly ask for the people\u2019s continued support, prayers and votes in November. Let\u2019s keep up the good fight!\u201d In Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds is set to advance to the general election, as she ran unopposed. The 58-year-old will face Democrat Fred Hubbell, a wealthy businessman, in November. Reynolds, a former lieutenant governor, took over as leader of the Hawkeye State after Terry Branstad became U.S. ambassador to China in 2017. Deb Haaland, a tribal member of Laguna Pueblo, is aiming to become the first Native American woman in Congress. (AP Photo/Juan Labreche) Democrat Deb Haaland won her party\u2019s primary in New Mexico Tuesday night -- putting her closer to making U.S. history as the first Native American congresswoman. If she wins the general, she would represent New Mexico\u2019s 1st congressional district, which encompasses Albuquerque. Haaland is a former leader of the Democratic Party in New Mexico and a tribal member of the Laguna Pueblo. TRUMP TWEETS PRIMARY DAY ENDORSEMENTS \u201cDonald Trump and the billionaire class should consider this victory a warning shot: the blue wave is coming,\u201d Haaland said after winning her primary. Haaland will face Republican Janice Arnold-Jones in November\u2019s general election for the seat vacated by Lujan Grisham. Arnold-Jones ran unopposed. Both Republicans and Democrats in California appeared to escape the state\u2019s jungle primary relatively unscathed, as neither party was shut out of certain competitive House races. The jungle primary system pushes the top two finishers of a race to the November elections, regardless of party. For Democrats, certain close House races are critical for taking back control of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. At least two of their best pickup opportunities in southern California have yet to be officially decided, but Democrats avoided being shut out from the ballot in the vast majority of the state\u2019s top battleground races. Republicans led the pack by a wide margin in many key races Tuesday. In the 48th congressional district, incumbent GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher was comfortably in first place with about 30 percent of the vote, despite being attacked by opponents for his ties to Russia. And in the 39th district, to replace retiring Rep. Ed Royce, Republican Young Kim was ahead with about 22 percent of the vote -- with Democrat Gil Cisneros less than 3 points behind. Republican Diane Harkey advanced to the November election in the 49th congressional district with 25 percent of the vote as of Wednesday morning, leading the pack by about 8 points in the the race to replace outgoing GOP Rep. Darrell Issa. Democrats need to pick up 23 GOP-controlled seats in order to take the House in the midterms. Out of California\u2019s 53 House seats, Republicans hold 14, and seven of those districts backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Judge Aaron Persky, who sentenced Brock Turner to six months in jail after he was convicted of sex crimes, was recalled by voters in California. He is the first judge to be recalled in more than 80 years. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) The judge who sentenced a former Stanford University swimmer to six months in prison for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman was recalled by voters Tuesday. Judge Aaron Persky sentenced Brock Turner, who was convicted of two counts of digitally penetrating an unconscious person and one count of assault with intent to rape, to six months in jail, but Turner was released from prison after only serving half that time. He was caught in January 2015 assaulting a woman behind a dumpster. WHY CALIFORNIANS LAUNCHED AN EFFORT TO RECALL JUDGE PERSKY, WHO SENTENCED BROCK TURNER The prison sentence set off a nationwide conversation about campus sexual assault and whether the nation\u2019s judicial system takes the crime seriously enough -- even before the height of the #MeToo movement. Michele Dauber, a Stanford University law professor and friend of victim, launched a campaign to recall Persky. \u201cThis is a historical moment in time. Women are standing up for their rights, and there is a national reckoning.\u201d The recall vote was considered to be one of the first electoral tests of the #MeToo movement\u2019s political strengths. Persky is the first California judge to be recalled in more than 80 years. \u201cThe broader message of this victory is that violence against women is now a voting issue,\u201d Dauber said in a statement. \u201cThis is a historical moment in time. Women are standing up for their rights, and there is a national reckoning.\u201d Assistant District Attorney Cindy Hendrickson will finish out the remaining four years of Persky\u2019s term, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale won the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate. He will face endangered incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, in the fall. (Thom Bridge/Independent Record via AP) Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale beat out the three other GOP contenders to secure his party\u2019s nomination to face incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, an endangered Democrat, in the fall. Rosendale, the 57-year-old former majority leader in the state Senate, was elected as Montana\u2019s state auditor in 2016. He had the endorsements of Sens. Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ted Cruz in the primary. Tester, a more conservative Democrat, drew the ire of Trump earlier this year during the kerfuffle over the president\u2019s pick to lead the Veterans Affairs Department. Adm. Ronny Jackson, who was the president\u2019s physician, withdrew his name from consideration for the Cabinet post following allegations about his prescription-drug practices and use of alcohol. Jackson was also accused of wrecking a government vehicle while intoxicated. The allegations were collected by Tester\u2019s office, as he is the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee. DEMOCRATS\u2019 PATH TO HOUSE TAKEOVER NARROWS: PARTY TRAILS IN CALIFORNIA RACES AS NEW YORK SEAT COMES INTO PLAY \u201cI\u2019ll fight for more freedom and prosperity for all Montana,\u201d Rosendale said after his primary victory. \u201cWe need to send Trump some conservative reinforcing that will end the liberal constriction.\u201d Rosendale beat out three other contenders to win Tuesday\u2019s primary: combat veteran Troy Downing, Judge Russ Fagg and state Sen. Albert Olszewski. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez will face pharmaceutical executive Bob Hugin, a Republican, in the general election. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez survived the Democratic primary after being ensnared in a corruption and bribery case last year. The trial ended in a mistrial after the jury said it could not reach a decision, but Menendez was \u201cseverely\u201d admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee. Menendez defeated publisher Lisa McCormick in the primary and will face pharmaceutical executive Bob Hugin, a Republican, in the fall. Throughout the primary -- even though the two men are not appearing on a ballot together until November -- Hugin and Menendez did not miss any opportunity to take jabs at one another. Both candidates raked in millions of dollars in campaign contributions. \u201cMy opponent, greedy drug company CEO Bob Hugin, is going to have to answer for his record of driving up prices for cancer patients while making millions for himself,\u201d Menendez said after his primary win. WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT SEN. MENENDEZ\u2019S CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY TRIAL Hugin has distanced himself from Trump throughout his campaign. He has said he is pro-choice, pro-marriage equality and \u201cstrongly support[s] equal pay for equal work.\u201d In the 2016 presidential election, Clinton took New Jersey with 55 percent of the vote; Trump won 41 percent. State Rep. Abby Finkenauer won the Democratic primary to take on incumbent Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa, in the fall. If she wins, she would be the youngest congresswoman elected. (Reuters/Tim Reid) State Rep. Abby Finkenauer won the Democratic primary to take on incumbent Rep. Rod Blum, a Republican, in the fall. If she wins the general election, Finkenauer, 28, would be the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., currently holds that record as she was elected in 2014 at the age of 30. Blum faces a tough re-election campaign in what Fox News has labeled a toss-up election. He ran unopposed in the primary, but a group of energized Democrats are vying to take him on in the general election. His seat is one targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said from day one, this is personal,\u201d Finkenauer said in a statement after her win. \u201cWe started this campaign to stand up for families just like mine, who work hard and play by the rules but have the odds stacked against them.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

It is often said, \u201cTo whom much is given, much is expected.\u201d\u00a0 The American people in Congressional districts across the country gave their support to Democratic candidates with an expectation that a Democratic majority would restore civility and order to a broken Washington. Now, my fellow Democrats, it is up to you to both serve your nation and lead your party. In 2019, Democrats will be in charge of the House. With power comes responsibility. \u00a0\u00a0I implore both newly elected and veteran House Democrats alike to rise to the occasion and become the adults in the room. It is possible to stay true to your principles while also finding ways to work with across the aisle.\u00a0 The American people are exasperated by the polarization and partisanship that has plagued our political landscape. Democrats have criticized Trump for dividing our nation and for using incendiary language.\u00a0 When the gavel is passed over, Democrats have a chance to lead by example.\u00a0 Rather than look for areas of disagreement, it\u2019s time to seek out common ground. Democrats and Republicans actually have key policy areas where they can work together.\u00a0 This is where Democrats should root their agenda.\u00a0 Here are some suggestions: - Democrats and Republicans both have indicated a willingness to make middle-class tax cuts permanent.\u00a0 Whoever becomes the new Chair of the House Ways & Means Committee should reach out to the GOP ranking member to co-sponsor a bill to do just that. - Infrastructure programs have usually benefitted from bipartisan support.\u00a0 A bipartisan bill investing in our roads, bridges, water and sewer projects is something everyone can get behind. - \u201cFighting for Fair Trade\u201d has been a battle cry of traditional Democrats for years.\u00a0 House Democrats should find ways to work with the Trump administration to enhance efforts to make our trade environment benefit workers. Nancy Pelosi declared in her victory speech Tuesday night that we all have had enough of division. Leader Pelosi, please practice what you preach. Put those words into action. Govern, do not obstruct. Reach out, don\u2019t resist. Compromise, don\u2019t chastise. Democrats can help bring our nation back together.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Kevin Brady joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss the Trump administration's tariffs and the second phase of tax cuts. President Trump and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, are moving forward with a new tax-cut plan \u2014 \u201can additional 10 percent tax cut to middle-class workers across the country,\u201d announced Wednesday. In a statement to Fox News, they said the tax-cut plan would mean \u201cdoubling the standard deduction, doubling the Child Tax Credit, and substantially lowering tax rates. A typical family of four earning $75,000 will get a tax cut of $2,000, which cuts their tax bill in half.\u201d The statement also pledged more benefits for middle-income Americans next year. Said Trump and Brady in the statement: \u201cBy enacting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we rejected the previous administration\u2019s assertion that a stagnant, slow-growth economy was the best America could do. The new law has changed the trajectory of our economy for the better. Not a single Democrat voted for our reforms, which have generated the fastest level of wage growth in nearly a decade, the highest level of consumer confidence in 18 years, and the lowest level of unemployment since 1969. Together, the Trump Administration and congressional Republicans are creating more economic opportunity for workers of all walks of life \u2014 especially for those hit hardest by the recession, who the previous administration left behind.\u201d Congress is out of session as lawmakers campaign for the Nov. 6 midterm elections. When pressed about when a bill could be approved, Trump insisted that \u201cwe\u2019ll do the vote after the election.\u201d MATTIS GIVES NO-NONSENSE RESPONSE TO REPORTER ASKING IF TROOP DEPLOYMENT TO BORDER IS 'POLITICAL STUNT' Trump is counting on that Congress can act in a lame-duck session this year or that Republicans will keep control of the House and Senate next year. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R- Utah, said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d the Senate would vote on Trump\u2019s tax cut plan after the election. When asked if it could pass, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen miracles happen before.\u201d TRUMP, AT FLORIDA RALLY, BASHES 'FAR-LEFT' MEDIA FOR SPREADING 'ANGER' IN PITTSBURGH COVERAGE The Senate narrowly approved Trump's sweeping 2017 tax-cut plan last December. No Democrats voted to pass it. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former Democratic vice president nominee pens op-ed urging voters to back incumbent Congressman Joe Crowley on a different ticket during the general election; Lieberman speaks out on 'Your World.' Joe Lieberman, the former Democratic senator, appealed to voters in New York's 14th Congressional District on Tuesday to vote in November for top Democrat Joe Crowley and not the Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In a scorching article for the Wall Street Journal, Lieberman, who\u2019s now an Independent, criticized Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s agenda as \u201cmore Socialist than Democratic\u201d and said her presence in Congress will \u201cmake it harder for Congress to stop fighting and start fixing problems.\u201d \u201cThanks to a small percentage of primary votes, all of the people of New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District stand to lose a very effective representative in Washington,\u201d he wrote. Ocasio-Cortez won last month in the Democratic primary against Crowley, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus who was thought by some to be a future Speaker of the House. She ran on the platform of abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Democratic Socialist agenda, earning endorsements from several left-wing groups, including MoveOn and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). FEUD ERUPTS BETWEEN DEM SOCIALIST OCASIO-CORTEZ AND DEFEATED REP. JOE CROWLEY But now she faces pushback from moderate voices who fear her firebrand Democratic Socialist brand may actually hurt the party\u2019s future prospects. \u201c[House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi] knows that if Democrats are to regain a majority, it will be by winning swing districts with sensible, mainstream candidates. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is making that task harder across America,\u201d Lieberman wrote. \u201cMs. Ocasio-Cortez is a proud member of the Democratic Socialists of America, whose platform, like hers, is more Socialist than Democratic. Her dreams of new federal spending would bankrupt the country or require very large tax increases, including on the working class,\u201d he continued. \u201cHer approach foresees government ownership of many private companies, which would decimate the economy and put millions out of work.\u201d \"Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is a proud member of the Democratic Socialists of America, whose platform, like hers, is more Socialist than Democratic.\" Lieberman also took a shot at Ocasio-Cortez views on international politics. \u201cMs. Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t speak much about foreign policy during the primary, but when she did, it was from the DSA policy book\u2014meaning support for socialist governments, even if they are dictatorial and corrupt (Venezuela), opposition to American leadership in the world, even to alleviate humanitarian disasters (Syria), and reflexive criticism of one of America\u2019s great democratic allies (Israel),\u201d he wrote. OCASIO-CORTEZ STARTS CONTROVERSY WITH COMMENTS ON ISRAELI \u2018OCCUPATION,\u2019 ADMITS SHE\u2019S \u2018NOT THE EXPERT\u2019 Ocasio-Cortez recently flip-flopped in the span of a few days on the issue of Israel and Palestine. On Friday, she asserted the Jewish state\u2019s right to exist but raised eyebrows after incoherent statements about Israel\u2019s \u201coccupation of Palestine.\u201d She insisted she\u2019s \u201cnot the expert at geopolitics on this issue.\u201d But during a town hall style sit-down with\u00a0Democracy Now\u00a0on Monday, she balked at repeating her support for the two-state solution and thus Israel\u2019s right to exist. \u201cThis is a conversation I\u2019m sitting down with lots of activists in this movement on and I\u2019m looking forward to engaging in this conversation,\u201d she said. There are increasing calls for Crowley to step up and run in the general election against Ocasio-Cortez, giving an actual choice to voters in the district where opposition has been non-existent for decades. Crowley will appear on the ballot of the Working Families Party. Last week, Ocasio-Cortez accused Crowley of still running against her in the general election. \u201c.@repjoecrowley stated on live TV that he would absolutely support my candidacy,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s stood me up for all 3 scheduled concession calls.\u201d Crowley responded to the accusations, saying he\u2019s not actively running in the general election. \u201cLots questions about WFP line. Was honored to have their support. I\u2019m not running. For record you can only be removed from the ballot if 1) you move out of NY; 2) die; 3) be convicted of a crime; 4) accept a nomination for another office (in a place I don\u2019t live),\u201d he tweeted. Lieberman ends the article with a ringing endorsement of Crowley, saying his re-election would show that \u201cthat Democrats are capable of governing again,\u201d noting that Crowley is a progressive \u201cbridge builder and problem solver, which is exactly what Congress needs more of in both parties.\u201d \u201cFor the sake of Congress and our country, I hope Joe Crowley will give all the voters of his district the opportunity to re-elect him in November\u2014and I hope they find his name on their ballots,\u201d he added.",

            "article_content": "Correspondent Doug McKelway looks at what socialism is and how perception of it is evolving. \"The future of the Democratic Party is the working class,\" proclaimed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a recent Los Angeles fundraiser. Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the democratic socialist movement, which is seeing a resurgence. She stunned the Democratic Party establishment with a primary victory over long-time incumbent Joe Crowley in New York's 14th Congressional District last summer.\u00a0But there are other\u00a0candidates making strong showings against mainstream competitors. Tampa, Florida,\u00a0 Mayor Andrew Gillum has a narrow lead against Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis in the race to replace\u00a0Gov. Rick Scott.\u00a0Real Clear Politics rates the Florida governor's race as a \"toss-up.\" The Democratic Socialists of America reports at least 46 other democratic socialist candidates have won primaries this year, and that the organization has grown from 7,000 members to 50,000 since President Trump was elected. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., who remains the movement's national leader, provoked\u00a0a presidential tongue-lashing Thursday morning because of his push for single-payer health care. \"If you look at Bernie's plan, it's government-run. The government can't run anything, they've proven that,\" Trump told \"Fox &\u00a0Friends\" in a telephone call. New York Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. (AP) So, what explains socialism's resurgence and how is it defined in contemporary American politics? \"Socialism comes in two flavors,\" said economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of America's Action Forum and\u00a0former head of the Congressional Budget Office. \"One flavor is when all of the means of production, all the companies, the factories, the hospitals, are actually owned by the government and run by the government. And the second flavor \u2013\u00a0they may be owned by private individuals but they are heavily regulated and essentially managed by the government.\" Critics say the passage of ObamaCare marked a watershed moment in socialism's U.S. return. They say its quasi-socialist system of redistributing health services and costs through government regulation\u00a0opened the door for many younger socialists who came of age during the 2008 recession that preceded ObamaCare. It was a time when families lost jobs, homes and\u00a0savings, and student loan debt ballooned. Many blamed capitalism, failing to grasp the history lessons of socialism. \"We know what a capitalist gas station looks like,\" Holtz-Eakin says. \"You can buy your gas and you go into the convenience store where there is a really astonishing array of food and snacks and drinks and lottery tickets and everything under the sun. If the socialist would have such a gas station, there would be one kind of gas, and inside there would be one snack, one kind of food, one drink,\u00a0and the shelves would by large be empty.\" Economists point to present-day Venezuela as an extreme case of socialism's devastating consequences \u2013 marked by food shortages, hyperinflation, government corruption, and a ruthless crackdown on the state's political enemies. Socialism\u00a0proponents like Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0speak of the economic philosophy's success in Nordic countries, where a high level of government services is made possible by extremely high personal income taxes. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., remains the socialist movement's national leader. (Associated Press) But Holtz-Eakin said that fails to point out that the socialism of Nordic countries is also made feasible by extremely low corporate taxes. He added the massive wave of immigration there is also helping to spark a nascent rejection of long-practiced socialism. In the U.S., Ocasio-Cortez is using socialism's resurgence to reach for more. \"We have to make single-payer health care happen in this country. We have to make tuition free, public colleges, and trade school happen in this country,\u201d she recently said. How to pay for it? Tax the rich, she says. That proposal conflicts sharply with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's admonition. \"The problem with socialism,\u201d Thatcher once said, \u201cis that eventually, you run out of other people's money.\u201d Free market economists acknowledge that socialism \u2013 with its promise of ubiquitous government services and equality of outcome \u2013 is a grand theoretical ideal, if only it were an ideal world. \"If you cannot achieve equality of performance among people born to the same parents and raised under the same roof,\u201d economist Thomas Sowell recently tweeted, \u201chow can you achieve it across broader and deeper social divisions?\"",

We're going to have the best coverage anywhere tomorrow night, so just keep it here folks. Bret, thank you so much. So, as Bret was saying, with just hours to go until the polls open, here is the final push. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This is one of the most important elections of our time. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: Your vote could make things a little bit better. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: That blue wave is going to hit a red wall right here in the Volunteer State. JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: We got to stick together, we got to move together. This is the United States of America, there is nothing we cannot do. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You need all -- get on the phone tonight and call everybody you know. That's how close it is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For the future of our country for the calls of Liberty, this is the time and this is the hour. REP. BETO O'ROURKE, D-TEXAS, SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: To change the government.

TRUMP: We are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win. OBAMA: Vote! (END VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story.\" As Republicans and Democrats forge ahead in the final sprint, less than 24 hours until we start to get the first wave in our election headquarters here for the results coming in, we're going to find out tomorrow night where does America really stand today. All-star panel for you tonight. Karl Rove, Mollie Hemingway, and Jess O'Connell. Plus two exclusives this evening. Texas Senator Ted Cruz who is defending his seat in the Senate against rising star, Beto O'Rourke for the Democrats. And Vice President Mike Pence who just made news by doubling down on his prediction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PENCE: I really believe that Republicans will expand our majority in the Senate and will hold our majority in the House of Representatives. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: There you have it. But first, chief national correspondent Ed Henry with the breakdown of the final push as it plays out tonight. Hi, Ed. ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Martha, great to see you. \u00a0Think about how much ground President Trump may have made up with these midterms. The campaign started with talk of a blue wave, skepticism about the president, putting himself front and center. But it's closing with prognosticator Nate Silver, hedging on whether Democrats will take back the House. And the president talking confidently today about GOP pickups in the Senate. The president doing exactly what he promised. What he suggest here early on, he would leave nothing in the locker room. He is been on the field, non-stop barnstorming all weekend. Three more rallies today in key battlegrounds, boasting about how he's had packed houses already today in Ohio and Indiana, as he pushes to one final rally tonight in Missouri. With Bill and Hillary Clinton largely on the sidelines, Democrats taking their relatively rare step of deploying the most recent former president against a successor. Barack Obama campaigning all weekend in charging the Trump administration is \"robbing you blind and warning voters not to be bamboozled.\" You mentioned that exclusive with Vice President Mike Pence in Montana, site of another key Senate battle. He and the president talking about caravan and illegal immigration. But the closing argument also includes a case for the strong economy. The president declaring that if Democrats score big wins, they will take what he calls a wrecking ball to the recovery. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: And I just had a call from Missouri. They say they've never seen anything like it. So, it's really something, something is happening. \u00a0There's a lot of electricity in the air. OBAMA: What kind of politics we expect is on the ballot? How we conduct ourselves in public life is on the ballot. PENCE: As I travel across the country, I get a sense, a great sense of enthusiasm. Just like I felt in 2016. And I think we're poised for a great victory on Tuesday, November 6. (END VIDEOTAPE) HENRY: It is ABC Washington Post poll had found 65 percent of the public has a positive view of the economy. That's up from 51 percent just before the inaugural. Highest level of optimism since 01. In a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll, the President does not seem quite as toxic as he's portrayed. 38 percent said their vote will be cast a signal opposition to him, 31 percent say their vote was signal support for the president. Now, the president told supporters today, he knows many in the media have already declared this is a referendum on him. But if he holds the House, the media may shrug and not exactly give him credit. But the president noted if the Republicans have a bad night, he expects they'll play it like its \"THE END OF THE WORLD.\" Martha? MACCALLUM: Thank you very much, Ed. So, here now with more, Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush and Fox News contributor. Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at the Federalist, and a Fox News contributor. Jess O'Connell, former CEO of the Democratic National Committee. Good to have all of you with us this evening. Karl, let me go to you first. You know, the president basically says, you know, no matter what happens, he'll be blamed for somehow being a failure in all this. KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well that's the role of a sitting president. I mean, we -- that's -- since 1860, we've only had three instances where the party of the president has picked up seats in the House in a midterm election. So, lots of presidents of great names have been blamed for the defeat of their party. This, this election now has played out weirdly with like so many things in the last couple of years. With the president being the beneficiary of a map that allowed him to campaign extensively on behalf of Senate candidates. And less so on behalf of House candidates. But we're likely to have a split decision. And so, people can scream all they like. But if it's a split decision, that's something of a victory for the president. MACCALLUM: Just as you look forward to tomorrow, and you look at all -- you know, the latest spread is plus three for the Democrats by, at least, one measure. So, it's clearly tightening a bit as we head into tomorrow. JESS O'CONNELL, FORMER CEO, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Yes, absolutely. This election is, is close. We are a divided country right now. But, this is an election of a lifetime, and I think that that's what we're seeing in this unprecedented participation out there. And on the Democratic side, as we know, there's a ton of enthusiasm that started with the hundreds of -- and thousands of candidates that started running from the very beginning along to the volunteers that are participating and have been participating for months now. Not just this past weekend. And then, we see the early voting and just how many people are coming out, we have 35 million Americans that have voted and young people. This is going to benefit Democrats for this election. Young people are fired up, they understand what's at stake, and President Trump is on the ballot, and that's what people are looking at right now. But also, so are the Republicans that have been complicit in this administration in where we are today. MACCALLUM: Yes. You know, I think it's fascinating. And all of this talk about it being -- you know, such a consequential moment in the midterms. \u00a0And I think that comes, Mollie, off of the fact that 2016 was such an enormously surprising and consequential election. So now is the first time that voters get sort of a next bite at the apple to say what their reaction is to 2016, and whether or not -- you know, their worst fears will realize or things are better than they thought. \u00a0What do you think, Mollie? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's important to remember, we might not get much of an answer. If you just go by the guide of history, Democrats should pick up 28 seats, which is more than enough to take back the House. I think it'd be better to wait and see if they take it by much more than that or they don't take it by as much before we determine exactly what that means in terms of a referendum, But there will probably be a lot of conflicting messages. I mean, Jesse is right that there is a divided republic. You might see things break in blue states a different way than you're seeing them break in red states. We might not see a consistent wave. We might be seeing excitement in a very polarized republic. MACCALLUM: Here is Mike Pence talking about his outlook. The president has suggested that they might lose the House. But the vice president feels this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PENCE: I believe that the Republicans will grow our majority in the United States Senate that will hold the House of Representatives. Because working with this president, Republican majorities have delivered exactly the results that we promised to the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I mean, Karl, you know obviously he's going to be optimistic with his outlook. He'd like to hold the party, but does anybody really know what's going to happen tomorrow? ROVE: Well, no. In fact, this is how were the election is. We've just been talking here about some of the races. Well, think about one thing we haven't been talking about. And that is there's almost universal acceptance that three Republican governors in deeply blue states are going to get reelected tomorrow. Hogan in Maryland and Baker in Massachusetts, Andrew Scott in Vermont. I mean, this is how were this election is. It's going to be driven a lot by individual -- the quality of the individual candidates who are able to navigate the currents in their states. And we're going to have a lot of false signals that this make -- this theme for example that Democrats are -- so, I heard Robert Francis O'Rourke in Texas' Beto say yesterday, we have a 500 percent increase in voter participation by those under the age of 30. Well, I went looked at the only evidence we have is in the early vote, and in the early vote in the top 15 counties in Texas. That's the only -- it's 63 percent of the statewide vote. It's the only part of the state for which we have detailed information. Voter participation by 18 and 19-year olds in 2016 was just over two percent of the total turnout. Now, it's just under two percent of turn out. Though, participation of the 20 to 29-year olds was 11 percent of the total of 2016. It's under 10 percent this time around. So, where we get these signals of all whether 500 percent increase in the youthful participation like Mr. Robert Francis O'Rourke said? I don't know, but that's we're going to -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: It wasn't counting on Karl Rove looking it up. In fact, checking him on it, that's for sure. Let's take a look at this from the president's editorial which is sort of his last statement ahead of the election tomorrow. And he really focused completely on the economy in this, which a lot of Republicans have been wanting him to focus on a lot more rather than the caravan. He says, \"America faces a critical choice whether to build on the extraordinary prosperity that Republican policies have delivered for our nation.\" And he goes on to say, \"Or whether to allow Democrats to take control and take a giant wrecking ball to your economy and your future.\" Jess, you know, this is a powerful argument when you look at the numbers. \u00a0You've got a GDP, 4.2. Unemployment, 3.7 percent, the lowest since the 1960s. Wages are increasing at a very strong rate up 3.1 percent. How can Democrats argue that the president isn't making good strides here? O'CONNELL: Look, I think that Democrats are running on three things right now. They're s on protecting health care, because that's the number-one thing that people are talking about throughout the country right now. \u00a0People are concerned about health care and Democrats are going to protect it. On the economy, look, folks want -- and this is not just Democrats, but this is a lot of Independents and some Republicans too. They want to see the continuation of the progress of both social and economic policies from the Obama era. And I think, President Trump can thank President Obama for some of the job growth that we've had over the last two years. And the last thing is this that folks really want to stop the chaos of the Trump administration, and President Trump, and they want to stop the complicity of Republicans who have -- you know, have been divisive over this time. And I think we're going to see a real reset tomorrow. And everybody is right, we don't know what's going to happen. We're not sure who's out there voting, but there are a million more Hispanics who are voting and when you are attacking folks for the last two years, people are going to show up, and we're going to see that tomorrow. MACCALLUM: We will see. I can't wait to see. I think it's going to be really exciting and that very interesting. Thank you, guys. Great to have all of you here tonight. So, coming up next, an exclusive interview with Texas Senator Ted Cruz as he fights to hang on to his Senate seat in a race that could go either way. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Now to the high-stakes showdown in Texas where more than $100 million have poured into that state's race. It is the most expensive Senate race in history. A record 4.8 million voters have already cast their ballots. Incumbent Senator Ted Cruz who is here live in moments is fighting to hold off his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke who was out with this new campaign ad claiming that he knows Texas best. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) O'ROURKE: There is something special happening in Texas right now. In really small towns and really big cities, people are getting off the sidelines and into the game. We are meeting the divisive miss that dominates politics today with a courage, strength, a big heart that could only come from Texas. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On the road again, just wait to get on the road again. The life I love is making music with my friends and I can't wait to get on the road again. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So that I think pretty well sums up sort of the tone of Beto O'Rourke's campaign and the message that he's been putting out there. \u00a0Joining me now Republican Senator Ted Cruz who is up for re-election in the Lone Star State. Senator, welcome. Good to have you with us tonight. \u00a0Good evening. CRUZ: Martha, great to be with you. Thank you. MACCALLUM: So let's take a look at the RCP average which is you know, an amalgam of some recent polls and it shows you at 51 percent, Beto O'Rourke at 45 percent. But you know, if you listen to your opposing candidate, he says that there is something happening out there in Texas, that something grassroots generated is going to make that number sort of a mirror image of itself come tomorrow. Are you concerned about that? CRUZ: Well, listen. You're right, there is something happening in Texas. \u00a0That adds an example of the slick Hollywood money that is pouring into the state of Texas, tens of millions of dollars. But if you give me a choice between millions of dollars from Hollywood Liberals or standing with the men and women of Texas, I will always choose the men and women of Texas. And I go to say, I'm encouraged -- I'm encouraged by what we're seeing on the ground. I'm encouraged by the momentum. I think the momentum is with us. We've seen that because of the last few weeks the O'Rourke campaign has gone hard negative. They've got super PACs flooding attack ads on the air because look the people of Texas, the values of Texas. We believe in low taxes, low regulations, lots and lots of jobs. We want to secure the border and we want to defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights. That has been my record in the Senate and it's -- and it's why I feel very good going into election day tomorrow. MACCALLUM: All right, so John Brennan is speaking out, former CIA Director. He says in this election those who stand with Trump must be defeated. And there was a time when you did not stand with President Trump. In fact, he didn't endorse him in the last presidential election. \u00a0So if you win, would you endorse President Trump and stand on the RNC stage and endorse him next time around? CRUZ: Martha, I've already endorsed President Trump and in fact, the President came to Texas and did a rally here in Houston where 100,000 people sign up to go to the rally. You know, it's interesting you brought up John Brennan. John Brennan was the head of CIA under Barack Obama. And if you look at foreign policy, we saw eight years of our friends and allies not trusting us and our enemies getting stronger and not fearing us. And it's that kind of weakness on the foreign policy stage, Texans don't want that. Texans are glad that today our embassy in Israel is now in Jerusalem. \u00a0Texans are glad that we have utterly defeated Isis. Texas are glad that the President had the courage to pull out of the disastrous Iranian nuclear deal. Beto O'Rourke, like Barack Obama, supported giving billions of dollars to the Ayatollah Khomeini who chants death to America. That's not the value of Texans, it is the value though of Hollywood Liberals. It is the value of the extreme left wing that wants to take on and stop all the good progress we've seen the last two years -- MACCALLUM: Well, let me -- CRUZ: -- with jobs, with security, and with freedom. MACCALLUM: Let me ask you this. Obviously, the President has made the caravan a big issue of late and we've you know, talked a lot about the progression but it's still quite a distance away but it's become a very potent issue in this campaign. And there are some evangelical voters in Texas who've been speaking out who say that they want a more compassionate perspective given to those members of the caravan and that some of them are crossing over from Republican to Democrat. What's your response? Your laughing. What's funny? CRUZ: Martha, you appear too smart to fall for that. That is silly media spin. Yes, the New York Times found three evangelicals in the state of Texas supporting Beto and they made a big story about it but it. But if you actually live on the planet Earth, listen, Beto O'Rourke is running a hard left Liberal campaign to the left of Elizabeth Warren, to the left of Bernie Sanders. He is the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country to call for impeaching President Trump. So for you to say that he's running an uplifting campaign, it's the most partisan -- MACCALLUM: So let me ask you this. So let me ask you this. Do you think -- let me ask you this. do you think that -- I've got a whole section here, you got it you got a whole back up session for you. So let me ask you this. Do you think that he -- you know, if you were going to just help him with his campaign which of course you won't, but if you -- do you think he ran too far left in Texas. Do you think that if had run more like a Joe Donnelly for example, he would be a tougher candidate for you to beat? CRUZ: Listen, of course, he did. But that's who he is. He is a far left liberal. If you look on immigration, he supports open borders, he supports sanctuary cities, he opposes Kate's law. I'm the author of Kate's law in the U.S. Senate and let me tell you what the people of Texas want. If you actually represent Texas, we want the border secured. We want the caravan stopped. Now, there's a right way to come to this country, Martha, and that's legally. You wait in line, you follow the rules the way my dad came to this country in 1957 from Cuba. And Texans don't want an open border Liberal representing the State of Texas. That doesn't -- on every issue, if Beto O'Rourke has a decision between siding with his Liberal donors, Hollywood donors nationally or siding with the people of Texas, he always, always, always sides with the far left. Let me give an example. Texas, there are millions of jobs that depend on energy, depend on oil and gas. We're in Houston, the oil and gas capital of the world. Beto O'Rourke voted in favor of a $10.00 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the State of Texas. That's not good. And the flip side -- let me tell you why we're going to win tomorrow. Because the people of Texas see this booming economy, we've cut taxes, we've cut regulations, we've got the lowest unemployment in 49 years. We've got the lowest African-American and Hispanic employment ever recorded. What we're doing works. MACCALLUM: Absolutely. So before I let you go. If all those things are true and he is so not what Texas wants which I'm hearing from you, why is it so close? CRUZ: Well, I don't think it's that close, but what I do think is happening and we're seeing this nationally is the extreme left is angry. \u00a0They're filled with rage. They're filled with hatred for the President. \u00a0That means they're showing up in massive numbers. So I want to speak to every Texan watching this show. If you want low taxes and low regulations and lots of jobs, if you want to secure the border and defend the Constitution, show up tomorrow. Bring your friends, bring your family, bring everybody because the hard left is coming and Texans, we got to stand up and defend common-sense conservative values. And a final point I'll tell you, Martha. We're seeing a coalition every rally we do. This is the 49th one we've done in six weeks. We have Democrats, conservative Democrats, moderate Democrats, Independents, Libertarians joining us in a common-sense coalition that stands for Texas, stands for jobs, freedom, and security because that's what we believe in. MACCALLUM: Senator, thank you very much. Thanks for taking the questions tonight. Good to see you. And we're going to be watching tomorrow to see how it all plays out in Texas. Thank you, sir. CRUZ: I appreciate it. God bless. MACCALLUM: You bet. So coming up next, right here, THE STORY is in the Sunshine State where another Republican is duking it out in a very tight race. Ron DeSantis locked in a tight battle with Andrew Gillum to be the next governor of Florida. He joins me live coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Two women who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct are now facing legal problems of their own. After a lengthy inquiry, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley is asking the Department of Justice to investigate both women for possibly lying and obstructing a congressional investigation. One case involves Julie Swetnick. In a sworn statement she accused Kavanaugh of drugging women who were then gang-raped but repeatedly contradicted aspects of her own statement in an interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you see Brett Kavanaugh you know, spiking the punch, put in -- JULIE SWETNICK, ACCUSER OF BRETT KAVANAUGH: I saw -- I saw him given red solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame. I don't know what he did but I saw him by them. Yes. I would see boys standing outside of brooms congregated together sort of like a gauntlets and I didn't know what was occurring. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: The second involves a woman named Judy Munro-Leighton who claimed that Kavanaugh raped her. But according to investigator, she later admitted that it was quote just a ploy and that she'd never met Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh of course, was confirmed but his reputation may be forever tarnished. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRETT KAVANAUGH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES: Ashley and I knew this process would be challenging. We never expected that it would devolve into this. Explaining this to our daughters has been about the worst experience of our lives. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So joining me now in \"The Story\" exclusive, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Republican from Iowa. Chairman Grassley, good to have you with us today. You know, a lot of people would ask, this is behind us now. So what's the point in continuing to pursue the claims of these two women? What would you tell them? SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY, R-IOWA, CHAIRMAN, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: We have to be able to make it very clear to the entire public that lying to Congress is a is a felony on a couple sections of our code and we want to make sure that the process not only of confirming Supreme Court justices but of course, almost anything where you want to take testimony from the general public that you want to know that it's truthful. And because every one of these things that come in whether it's anonymous or whether there's a name connected with it, it takes a lot of hours for staff to follow up to see if it's legitimate. And we want to discourage coming to Congress with information that not only hurts individuals but is outright wrong and spend a lot of resources of the federal government to follow up on it. So, we want to discourage that and that's why we have urged the FBI and the Justice Department to follow up to see if prosecution is legitimate. Congress can't prosecute, but we can suggest things that are wrong and we have a responsibility to turn over to the proper law enforcement people when we know that's a crime may have been committed. MACCALLUM: OK. So, with regard to Ms. Munroe-Leighton, she, there was a Jane Doe letter that was written about a horrific situation. In this Jane Doe letter, Jane Doe said that she was raped in the back of a car by the judge who was trying to become the next Supreme Court justice which he ultimately did. Now then this woman, Munroe-Leighton, she then called your office as I understand it and said that was me, I'm the person who claim that and no longer a Jane Doe. What did you learned about her, what did your investigators learned about her, what did she say once you found her? GRASSLEY: Well, first of all, it was an anonymous letter that came from California through Senator Harris of California. And then it was anonymous at that point. So, we followed up and we were able to track the name down of this lady and following up with her, we found out it was a stunned on her part and she admitted so much. But it might have been something that was funny to her at the time or she wanted to get part of the action. She may have not liked Justice Kavanaugh. Whatever reasons, I don't know. But the point is, it took a lot of time for our staff to follow up. MACCALLUM: Yes. GRASSLEY: Because we have a responsibility to follow up on that and we've got to discourage that. And that's why she was likewise turned over to the FBI for investigation. MACCALLUM: Yes. She said, \"I did it as a way to grab attention. I was angry so I sent it out.\" She said it was a tactic and a ploy and that she was opposed to the nomination. So, she is saying that she didn't actually write the original letter. She said she did because she wanted to jump on the bandwagon as I understand it. Now with regard to Julie Swetnick and Michael Avenatti, he attorney, we should, some of the contradictions that she pointed out in the interview that were different than the original statement that she made that was submitted to your committee. Here's what Michael Avenatti is saying about your committee pursuing this with the DOJ. He says, \"Chuck Grassley's partisan report is garbage. There is no evidence that my client or I did anything wrong. We are still waiting and hoping the FBI fully investigates this matter. Chuck evidently didn't have any juice.\" He says. GRASSLEY: Well, first of all, he got very personal with me. You didn't read that part of it. But it kind of tells me what generally happens when lawyers don't have the facts on their side then they start attacking the individual. But also, he asking in one of his TV interviews, he said that he tried to have this whole thing open up because the facts will get out. I don't know how many more facts you can get out than 32 hours of questioning by every member of the committee. And then 1200 questions that were put to him in writing, what other information could get out that hasn't already been asked and answered. MACCALLUM: Well, let me ask you this. Do you plan to pursue or reopen or refer to the DOJ anything with regard to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford or Deborah Ramirez? GRASSLEY: At this point, no, but we put out a 414-page report over the weekend that I would refer you and your listeners too. And that leaves open the possibility of further investigations and further action that can be taken. But right now, I'm not in a position not because I don't want to answer your question, I just don't have an answer for you. MACCALLUM: OK. And last question, if Democrats do take over control of the House, there's some -- or the Senate, which could happen as well of course, there is some discussion that they might reopen the investigation possibly in the perjury of Judge Kavanaugh. Your thoughts on that? GRASSLEY: Well, my thoughts on it are that with everything that's been coming up, everything accusation that's been made, and none of it stuck, and they don't find any problems with his record of 12 years on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and everything they threw at him personally nothing stuck to the wall, it just seems to me that they are going down a wild-goose chase. They can do anything they want to. But to say after four days and 100 days that he was before the United States, four days of hearings and 100 days through before the Senate before he was approved that's about a third longer than the average Supreme Court justice has. If they think they can bring something out, let them go to it. But I think they are barking up a tree. MACCALLUM: All right. Senator Chuck Grassley, thank you very much, chairman. It's always good to see you. Thank you for being here tonight. GRASSLEY: You bet. Thank you, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, coming up next, Congressman Ron DeSantis standing by live as he hits the home stretch in his race for governor of Florida. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Here we are up here. The race for Florida governor shaping up to be another one of the most anticipated races in the country. And in typical Florida fashion, it could come down to the wire. Republican Ron DeSantis is in a very tough race against Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee. He is trailing in the latest Quinnipiac poll by seven points. Joining me now, Congressman Ron DeSantis. Good to have you with us, Congressman DeSantis. Welcome to the Story tonight in Florida. Talk to me a little bit about early voting. Because in the early count, Democrats seem to be outpacing an early voting. Does that concern you? REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLA.: Well, actually, we are going to be ended about 70 to 80,000 votes ahead of where Republicans were in 2016 which, of course, if you remember, we swept all the statewide Senate race, presidential race. So, we are going to be going into the election in a much stronger position than we did in 2016. Our voters tend to prefer to vote on election day, so I think we have our habitual voters that we're going to mobilized. Obviously, we're going to bring new people into the poll, but I think we're going to decisively win on election day and I think that will put us in a good position to win the race. MACCALLUM: So, in terms of the younger voter turnout, that also tends to be up in the early voting. I mean, obviously you look at all these demographics, you tried to figure out to kind of extrapolate from early voting to who you are expecting, as you say to come in on election day. Does that concern you? And if not, you know, what areas are you going to really focus on in these final hours where you feel you really need to drive up your turnout? DESANTIS: Well, we, I think that any of those increases are outpaced by other increases. I mean, our baseline is 2016. I don't think 2014 is a very good barometer. MACCALLUM: Right. DESANTIS: This is going to be a significantly higher turnout than 2014. And we're already seeing it with Republicans. And so, you know, our thing is we've identified the voters we need. You know, we are trying to turn them out. I think if we do that we will win because I will get more Democrat votes than Gillum will get Republican votes. And if you hold drawn with independents and the Republicans turnout, that's how Republicans win statewide elections in Florida. And so that's we are in track to do but we are working hard until the very final buzzer tomorrow night. MACCALLUM: All right. The question of voters who moved from Puerto Rico after hurricane Maria to Florida, when these races are this razor tight, you know, a few thousand votes obviously could make a big difference. Do you feel like those voters are going to support you or they are going to support -- you know, you were obviously in government, in federal government as a member of Congress? Or will they lean towards Gillum on that? DESANTIS: Well, I think it will be a mix. You know, we had the congresswoman from Puerto Rico and Orlando with us campaigning today, Jennifer Gonzalez, a good friend of mine. I've been working with her on these issues for the last two years. She's endorsed me. We had legislators from Puerto Rico coming in to endorse me and support me. So, we are going to do very well there. But we will definitely do very well in Dade County with the Hispanics down there. So, I think all in all, you know, we are going to be very competitive with the Hispanic vote. I think we've got a good shot to win it but certainly will be neck-and-neck statewide. MACCALLUM: All right. Congressman DeSantis, thank you. We'll be watching it all, obviously very closely from here. Good to have you with us tonight. DESANTIS: Thank you. MACCALLUM: You bet. So, coming up next, brand-new dials revealing how Republicans and Democrats and independents really feel about issues just hours before they cast their vote. When we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So, we're just hours away, as you know, and we've got exclusive new dials from Republicans, Democrats, and independents for a read on the how the key issues like immigration and healthcare are playing with voters this election. My next guest conducted the analysis, Lee Carter, you know her well, communications strategist and president of Maslansky and Partners. Good to have you with us, Lee, tonight. LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY & PARTNERS: Good to be here. MACCALLUM: This are some of the sound bites that we picked that we wanted to see what people's reaction was to them to kind of get them a gauge for how they are feeling about these topics, so let's jump right in. This is President Trump. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A caravan of thousands of people and now others forming pouring up into our country, we have no idea who they are. All we know is they are pretty tough people, throwing rocks viciously and violently. We are going to put up with that. They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. We are going to consider -- and I tell them consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say, consider it a rifle. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Wow. That's fascinating. CARTER: It is such a divided country and the way people hear this is totally different depending on where you sit. Democrats said, look at him, he such a racist. How could anybody believe this. Republicans said, he is right on. Independents, though, are different. They say, I agree with him, he's just a little bit over the top. I don't think he really means it. The temper what he means but they agree with him on policy and principle, and that's not coming through necessarily on all the polls. I think we are going to see some different results that we might expect tomorrow. MACCALLUM: All right. Let's take a look at this one on birthright citizenship. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Congress has never passed a law requiring birthright citizenship for illegal aliens, and the Constitution does not -- I say that to the media -- does not require it. Read it. Because illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: How do you read that? CARTER: See, you can see it here, again, at the very end, they start today because that's where they are going back to the middle there, but you see Republican said things like I agree with him 2,000 percent completely into this, independents said, I'm not sure he can constitutionally make this happen so I'm going to ignore it and pretend it never happened. And Democrats are right back at it saying he is racist, this is terrible, this is the worst thing, he's going to destroy our country. The people are interpreting this so, so differently. MACCALLUM: I think the independents line is fascinating to watch. let's try another one. This is President Obama on GOP and healthcare. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: It's election season, and what else? You've got Republicans out there saying \"Well, we will protect pre-existing conditions.\" Trust this, if they win this Tuesday, they will finally succeed, if they get control of Congress, you better believe they are coming after your healthcare. Florida, we can't let Rick Scott become the deciding vote. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARTER: We can see there again Democrats off the charts, they love this message but what's really interesting to me is Republicans called them a liar and independents, most importantly to me who said, you know what, this is fear-base campaigning. He and the Democrats are accusing the Republicans are being fear-based? That is what he's doing and they didn't think that it was accurate. I'm not so sure that he is the best surrogate-- MACCALLUM: yes. CARTER: -- out there for the Democrats (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: I mean, we know more and more people are not identifying with the party. So that yellow line is so significant in terms of whether or not, you know, skewing closer to the Republican line or closer to the Democratic line. One more that we just want to get in here. Hillary Clinton saying that she doesn't want to run but she does want to be president. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you want to run again? HILLARY CLINTON, D- FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wait. CLINTON: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There was a pause. Why? CLINTON: Well, I'd like to be president. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) CARTER: I think that's pretty self-explanatory, but you could see even the Democrats weren't excited about her anymore. She's lost her relevance. The big problem the Democrats have right now in addition to not having a message outside of the healthcare policy, is they don't have a spokesperson, they don't have a leader, they don't have anybody that people are resonating with. And so that makes it really hard for people to follow because who are you following and what plans and policies are you following? Any time we had a big turnaround do you think about Newt Gingrich or the contract for America. MACCALLUM: Right. CARTER: He had a proposal to make things better for the American people. The Democrats just simply don't have that right now. MACCALLUM: Yes. CARTER: And it could get them. MACCALLUM: I wonder how ticket sales are going to be for the Bill and Hillary concert tour. I just wonder. You know, when I look at that, well, I'm just curious. So, we'll see what happens. Lee, thank you. (CROSSTALK) CARTER: Thank you so much. MACCALLUM: Great to have you here. It's really interesting. So, Saturday Night Live under fire for a joke about wounded war hero and congressional candidate Dan Crenshaw. But it's Crenshaw's response, that is not to be missed. Governor Mike Huckabee up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE DAVIDSON, COMEDIAN: This guy is kind of cool. Dan Crenshaw. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come on, man. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go. Go on. DAVIDSON: You may be surprised to hear he's a congressional candidate from Texas and not a hit man in a porno movie. I'm sorry. I know he lost his eye in war of whatever. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Whatever. So that's Saturday Night Live facing backlash after those comments about Republican congressional candidate in Texas Dan Crenshaw. Back in 2012, the former Navy SEAL was on a mission in Afghanistan when an IED went off in front of him and caused him to lose his right eye. This morning, he responded to SNL's joke this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAN CRENSHAW, CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, R-TEXAS: They certainly crossed the line but their apology won't mean anything to me. I think what they should do is maybe pool their money together and donate to some veterans' charities out there that could really use some help. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Here now, Governor Mike Huckabee, Fox News contributor. Governor, good to have you with us. We should mention Dan Crenshaw did five tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. After he lost his eye, he went back for two more tours of duty. He is an American hero, governor. MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Without a question, he's an American hero and he showed a level of class in his response that is just stunning. Pete Davidson might have done him a favor. They have sealed his election to a member of Congress. One way to put it is that Dan Crenshaw really showed some class, Pete Davidson showed his 'ass-pirations' to be comedian and failed dramatically. And I would think that NBC has a responsibility not because of Pete Davidson but that was scripted. Here's the issue. Pete Davidson is a 24-year-old kid. I'm going to cut him some slack which may surprise some people. He's a kid. He doesn't have a frame of reference that really helps him to put into perspective the kind of sacrifice that a person like Dan Crenshaw has made. But there is surely some adults that work at NBC who look at that script and had to have thought, maybe this isn't the best thing we ought to be talking about when it comes to a true American hero. MACCALLUM: Here's Joy Behar reacting on The View. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, ABC: His father died in 9/11. And his coming from a place of, you know, you make fun of things that are so painful to lighten the load, that's where he's coming from. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What do you think about that, governor? HUCKABEE: I respect the fact that Pete Davidson's father who was a firefighter in New York on 9/11 and did die. Pete was seven years old at that time. And I think, you know, we certainly can recognize that there's a lot of pain in his life from that but that doesn't give you the right to make that kind of comparison to somebody who has lost an eye serving his country. And as you pointed out, Martha, this is a guy who continued serving even after he lost an eye. The military would have definitely retired him on medical disability. He refused. He wanted to continue to be a warrior and to serve his nation, and he did. In the great scheme of things, Dan Crenshaw, I believe truly show that an apology at this point is meaningless because nobody would believe it's sincere. MACCALLUM: Yes. HUCKABEE: But I think it ought to be a lesson, maybe one of those teachable moments as President Obama used to talk about, and perhaps NBC could come forward and do exactly what I think the incoming congressman from Texas, Dan Crenshaw suggested and that's make a very substantial donation, not to Crenshaw but to veterans like him. MACCALLUM: Yes. That was a noble idea and I think it would be nice. I also loved what Dan Crenshaw said about, you know, forgiveness, and not everyone needs to be fired for something that they've said. We sort of gone too far down that road of making those kinds of judgments. And you I think are right about Pete Davidson, he's a young guy, and you know, no doubt he will learn something from it down the road. Thank you very much, governor. Always good to have you with us. Always wise words. HUCKABEE: I appreciate it, Martha. MACCALLUM: Good to see you, sir. HUCKABEE: Thank you. MACCALLUM: You bet. So that is our story on this election eve. Tomorrow night, Bret Baier and I will be right downstairs from here in our amazing studio anchoring Fox News special coverage of the 2018 midterms.

            "article_content": "Cuomo defeats Cynthia Nixon in New York's Democratic gubernatorial primary. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Friday ripped into New York\u2019s Democratic socialist wave after he comfortably fended off a gubernatorial primary challenge from actress and activist Cynthia Nixon -- appearing to dismiss the movement as \u201cnot even a ripple.\u201d \u201cThat is a revolution,\u201d he said of his win, according to the New York Daily News. \u201cThat is a wave. On the numbers. Not on some Twittersphere dialogue where I tweet you and you tweet me and between the two of us, we think we have a wave. We\u2019re not even a ripple.\u201d As Democratic socialists knock off long-standing establishment candidates across the country, Cuomo was a top-tier target for the Democratic Party\u2019s left-wing activist base. But, accompanied by a hefty campaign war chest and backing that included Hillary Clinton and labor groups, Cuomo was able to see off Nixon, despite her celebrity credentials as a former \"Sex and the City\" actress and her populist platform. In doing so, Cuomo had touted his progressive achievements on the minimum wage, gun control and same-sex marriage, but presented himself as one that could get things done. Nixon had claimed he dove to the left to fend off her campaign, calling it \u201cThe Cynthia Effect.\u201d 'SEX AND THE CITY' STAR BOASTS CUOMO BEING DRAGGED TO THE LEFT BY 'THE CYNTHIA EFFECT' In his remarks to reporters on Friday, he looked to present himself as the pragmatic progressive rather than a \"pontificator.\" \"A progressive Democrat, a Democrat in New York state, these are not ivory tower academics, these are not pontificators, these are not people who live in the abstract or theoretical,\" he said according to the Daily News. \"New York Democrats, these are hard-working men and women, they\u2019re middle class, they\u2019re working families, they have real problems, and they need real help in life, and they don\u2019t need theoretical or abstract solutions, they need real solutions in their lives.\" While an obvious dig at Nixon, Cuomo also appeared to take a knock at 25-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat Rep. Joe Crowley in a primary in June. Ocasio-Cortez has become something of a national leader for progressives, pushing left-wing policies such as Medicare for all and the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \"I am not a socialist. I am not 25 years old. I am not a newcomer,\" Cuomo said. \"But I am a progressive, and I deliver progressive results.\" Nixon\u2019s campaign, however, indicated that the race was less to do with ideas and more about money. \u201cWe can maybe do it when we\u2019re outspent three-to-one, or four-to-one, but not 10-to-one, or 20-to-one,\u201d Rebecca Katz, a top adviser to Nixon told The New York Times, which reported Cuomo is expected to have spent $25 million. Cuomo will face Republican Marc Molinaro and Independent Stephanie Miner in November\u2019s election.",

            "article_content": "The midterms leave power split in Washington as Democrats retake control of the House of Representatives and Republicans expand Senate majority. But what does a divided Congress mean for the future? Democrats reclaimed\u00a0control of the House of Representatives Tuesday night after eight long years out of power, dealing a major setback to President Trump's legislative agenda -- but Republicans were able to expand their narrow Senate majority and, with it, preserve the ability to confirm crucial judicial nominees. The split decision on Capitol Hill follows one of the most intense and chaotic midterm campaign seasons in recent memory, in which President Trump barnstormed the country for GOP candidates and powerful Democrats, including predecessor Barack Obama, did the same for the other side. For his part, Trump was able to help prevent a total Democratic takeover in Congress, and he avoided a repeat of President Obama's first midterm elections in 2010, when his party lost\u00a06 seats in the Senate and 63 in the House. Retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.,\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that \"history had repeated itself\" Tuesday night, noting\u00a0that since 1862, the president's party has lost an average of 32 House seats during the midterms. After Tuesday's elections, Democrats appeared poised to gain approximately two dozen\u00a0seats in the House, while Republicans looked to net at least two Senate seats. \"I'm proud of the campaign that our members and candidates ran in a challenging political environment,\" he said. The president reacted positively but tersely to the results late Tuesday, writing on Twitter, \"Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!\" Hours later, he quoted author\u00a0Ben Stein, said that \"there\u2019s only been 5 times in the last 105 years that an incumbent President has won seats in the Senate in the off year election\" and that Trump \"has magic about him.\" In a boost for Trump, the GOP's continued hold on the Senate gives Republicans\u00a0control over all critical federal judicial appointments, including nominations to the Supreme Court. Republicans flipped a number of marquee Senate seats on Tuesday, with wins by\u00a0Josh Hawley over\u00a0Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri,\u00a0Rep. Kevin Cramer over Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Republican Gov. Rick Scott over longtime Sen. Bill Nelson in Florida, and Mike Braun over Joe Donnelly in Indiana. All four of those ousted Democrats opposed the confirmation of Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanuagh, who was besieged by uncorroborated -- and in some cases discredited -- allegations of sexual misconduct. And GOP Sen. Ted Cruz also held off a well-funded\u00a0insurgent challenge from Beto O'Rourke in Texas by a slim margin. (In a sign that Texas remains deeply conservative overall, popular GOP Gov.\u00a0Greg Abbott defeated Democrat Lupe Valdez by more than 14 points.) \"With gains in the Senate, Republicans defied history, an achievement reached only four times in history,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said, adding that the GOP had turned Democrats' \"tsnumani into a ripple.\" But Democrats' win in the House gives fresh hope to liberals who want to investigate and perhaps even impeach the president. The takeover in that chamber ensures a contentious next two years leading into the 2020 presidential elections. \"With gains in the Senate, Republicans defied history, an achievement reached only four times in history.\" Democrats will also be able to halt many items on Trump's legislative wishlist, including funding for his proposed border wall and a new middle-class tax cut -- or at least extract major\u00a0concessions on issues like immigration reform before Trump gets his way. Although the exact size of the parties' respective majorities in the House and Senate is not clear,\u00a0Democrats will soon have to decide whether to restore Nancy Pelosi to her old job as speaker of the House, which she held from 2007 to 2011. \"We will have a Congress that is open transparent and accountable to the American people,\" Pelosi said Tuesday night. \"We will work for the boldest common denominator.\" \u201cTomorrow will be a new day in America,\u201d she added.\u00a0\u201cWe have all had enough of division. The American people want peace. They want results.\u201d The midterms, Pelosi said, were primarily about\u00a0\u201crestoring the Constitution\u2019s checks and balances to the Trump administration.\" Previewing an adversarial relationship with the White House even as she said Democrats \"strive for unity,\" Pelosi charged that Republicans are becoming \"more destructive every day\" and are bent on enriching the wealthy. Pelosi and top Democrats have vowed to open a series of investigations into the White House upon reclaiming the House, including probes into Trump's unreleased personal tax returns, alleged collusion with Russia,\u00a0and potential ethics violations by administration officials. \"We will work for the boldest common denominator.\" Prominent firebrands including Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters, Adam Schiff, and Jerry Nadler are slated to be elevated to lead the House Financial Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Judiciary Committee, respectively. With control of those and other key committees, Democrats will have the legal authority to issue subpoenas to compel Republicans and others to provide documents or appear at hearings -- and to seek contempt proceedings if they don't comply. \"We will be able to get answers the Republicans were unwilling to pursue,\" Schiff told CNN in October.\u00a0\"Records that the Republicans wouldn't ask for.\" (Pelosi has said that trying to obtain Trump's tax returns would be \"one of the first things we'd do.\") Schiff added that he would place a \"very high priority\" on determining whether the Trump Organization had laundered money through Russia. Republicans, meanwhile, defied expectations of a blue wave largely on the strength of several major wins in the Senate. Cruz sealed the result with his\u00a0defeat of O\u2019Rourke\u00a0in the most expensive Senate race in American history. The 46-year-old O'Rourke, who had sought to become the first Democrat to win a statewide race in Texas since 1994,\u00a0set fundraising records by taking in $70 million last quarter alone. He\u00a0launched his campaign on a promise of bipartisanship and unity that contrasted sharply with Cruz's strongly conservative\u00a0record. But O'Rourke's\u00a0policy proposals -- including impeaching President Trump, adopting an expensive \"Medicare-for-all\" program, and potentially abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), agency -- alienated many voters in Texas' conservative strongholds. And Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley\u00a0took down vulnerable incumbent Democratic Sen.\u00a0McCaskill, whose appeal\u00a0in a state Trump carried by double digits in 2016 faded as she voted\u00a0against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. On Monday, McCaskill, who has presented herself as a moderate, claimed she \"didn't care\" which party won the Senate. \"Obviously we fell short, and that is disappointing,\" McCaskill said Tuesday night. \"I feel pain for people who said they're going to do more than sit on the couch and cuss the TV.\" BETO BLOCKER: CRUZ TRUMPS O'ROURKE, WHO BROUGH IN RECORD-HIGH CAMPAIGN DONATIONS The Fox News Decision Desk also assesses\u00a0that Cramer will unseat one-term Democratic Sen. Heitkamp in North Dakota, scoring a crucial Senate pickup for the GOP. Heitkamp, who had long struggled against Cramer in the reliably red state, may have sealed her political fate last month when she also opposed Kavanaugh's confirmation. In Indiana, Mike Braun, a businessman, will defeat first-term Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, another Democrat whose vote against Kavanaugh proved costly. The race was one of the most closely fought races in the country, and Braun's victory marks another big win for the GOP. Trump had aggressively campaigned for Braun in recent days. FULL MIDTERM RESULTS In another key race for Republicans, the\u00a0Fox News Decision Desk projects that Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn will defeat former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen to replace retiring GOP Sen. Bob Corker.\u00a0While Blackburn spent all summer trailing Bredesen in the polls, she closed the gap and took the lead about a month ago, despite a last-minute endorsement by pop star Taylor Swift for Bredesen. TAYLOR FADE: SWIFT'S ENDORSEMENT SOUNDS SOUR NOTE AFTER BREDESEN GOES DOWN Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will also defeat Democrat Jenny Wilson to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch, as expected. The former Massachusetts governor, previously a fierce Trump critic, secured his support after backing his presidency. Democrats also saw some expected, but significant, Senate wins. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez will win re-election by defeating Republican businessman Bob Hugin. And the Fox News Decision Desk also projects that West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin will win re-election by defeating Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.\u00a0Manchin was the only member of his party to vote to confirm\u00a0Kavanaugh.\u00a0In Michigan, Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow will win a fourth term by defeating Republican businessman John James, a combat veteran who was strongly backed by President Trump, Fox News projects. The Fox News Decision Desk also projects that none of the four candidates in Mississippi's special Senate election will win tonight because none garnered 50 percent of the vote. The top two finishers \u2013 Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democratic challenger Mike Espy -- will face each other in a runoff election on Nov. 27. A number of other key races remain too close to call, including the contest between Montana incumbent Sen.\u00a0Jon Tester and Republican challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor. President Trump has made it his mission to defeat Tester, who helped torpedo Trump\u2019s nomination of White House physician Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. At this moment, Tester has fallen behind in the race. In Nevada, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen will defeat incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller, cutting into the\u00a0GOP's gains in the Senate. Heller was widely regarded as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress. The Fox News Decision Desk also cannot yet project a winner in Arizona, where Republican Rep. Martha McSally is in a tight battle with Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Determining the winner could\u00a0take days. Democrats were able to regain the majority in the House by flipping key seats; they needed to take 23 for a majority. In Northern Virginia's 10th Congressional District, GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock is projected to lose\u00a0to her\u00a0Democratic challenger, state Sen. Jennifer Wexton. Comstock\u00a0was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress. And 77-year-old Democrat Donna Shalala, who served as Secretary of Health and Human Services\u00a0under President Bill Clinton, has defeated Republican opponent Maria Elvira Salazar in\u00a0Florida's\u00a027th Congressional District, which has long been held by the GOP. Democrat Joe Cunningham pulled off an upset by defeating Katie Arrington in in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, which Republicans have held since 1981. Some major Democratic efforts to flip\u00a0Republican-controlled seats came\u00a0up short. In Kentucky's 6th Congressional District,\u00a0Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath. The two had been competing in a neck-and-neck race, which Democrats saw as an opportunity\u00a0to flip a seat in a GOP-leaning district. McGrath, the first female Marine to fly an F/A-18 on a combat mission,\u00a0campaigned on a largely anti-Trump platform. And Republican Denver Riggleman has defeated Democrat Leslie Cockburn to keep a closely watched Virginia congressional seat in the hands of the GOP.\u00a0Virginia's 5th Congressional District is home to\u00a0incumbent\u00a0GOP Rep. Tom Garrett, who announced that he would not seek re-election earlier this year amid mounting scandals. While the district supported President Trump in 2016 by double-digits,\u00a0the contest had been tight between\u00a0Cockburn, a former journalist who favors Medicare-for-all, and\u00a0Riggleman, a staunch Republican. Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly speaks during a U.S. Senate Debate against Republican former state Rep. Mike Braun and Libertarian Lucy Brenton, Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings, Pool) Meanwhile, the Fox News Decision Desk projects that Democratic Sens. Sen. Tim Kaine in Virginia, Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, and Sherrod Brown in Ohio, as well as\u00a0Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, will all cruise to victory. WATCH: COMSTOCK SAYS THREAT TO IMPEACH\u00a0KAVANAUGH IS 'RIDICULOUS' Democrat and former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger also defeated Tea Party-affiliated Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who has represented the state's 7th Congressional District since 2014, when he stunned the nation by unseating then-House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor. Trump\u00a0carried this district by 7 points in 2016, and it has had a Republican representative for almost 50 years. But changing demographics put it in play and led to Spanberger's win.

            "article_content": "The Washington Post fact-checks Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's comments on the campaign trail. A fiscally conservative Democrat soundly defeated five other high-profile opponents to represent Honolulu in Congress on Saturday, including the architect of the state's legal challenge to President Trump's travel ban and a follower of Democrat socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The results in the deeply liberal state were yet another blow to Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who have increasingly tried to take their message mainstream ahead of the November midterm elections, only to see their preferred candidates come up short. Former Congressman Ed Case, a 65-year-old fiscal conservative, overcame Lt. Gov. Doug Chin, who as attorney general took the Trump administration to court over a ban on travel to the United States from several countries in the Middle East. The measure, which has since been upheld by the Supreme Court, was initially ruled unconstitutional by a Hawaii federal judge. After his loss Saturday, Chin praised \"people who don't want to take the country for granted and want to make the country a better place.\" DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST TORCH-BEARERS FLAME OUT NATIONALLY, DESPITE HIGH-PROFILE ENDORSEMENTS Case also took down\u00a029-year-old Kaniela Ing, a democratic socialist who hoped to follow in the footsteps of colleague Ocasio-Cortez of New York to score an upset victory. Ing, a state representative, had Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement, and the Bronx socialist candidate had stumped for him. Overall, Case received 47,482 votes, or 40 percent of the total, compared to 25.5 percent for Chin, and only 6.3 percent for Ing. \"Two weeks before my race, I was polling 35 points down,\" Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday during a major campaign event for Ing, which local reports said was one of the biggest in the state's history. \"And we changed that in two weeks because we were talking to people who hadn\u2019t been excited about the political process before.\" Hawaii's high taxes and surging homelessness put a dent in enthusiasm for establishment Democrats in the deep-blue state, leading some analysts to predict Ing would have performed better. But his loss, like the primary defeats last week of populist Michigan gubernatorial hopeful Abdul El-Sayed and congressional candidate Fayrouz Saad, as well as Kansas House candidate and former Sanders staffer Brent Welder, left Ocasio-Cortez's followers empty-handed. Case will face Cam Cavasso, a former state representative who previously ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate. Meanwhile, Hawaii Gov. David Ige won the state's Democratic primary Saturday in his bid for a second term, overcoming a tough primary challenge and fierce criticism after state officials sent out a false inbound missile alert earlier this year and left it uncorrected for more than 30 minutes. Ige defeated\u00a0U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, who gave up her seat in Congress to run for governor. Ing took 51.4 percent of the vote with 119,310 ballots, compared to Hanabusa's 44.4 percent. The incumbent in November will face state Rep. Andria Tupola, who won the Republican gubernatorial primary. David Ige overcame fierce criticism for his administration's false missile alert earlier this year, which led to accusations of widespread government incompetence in the state. (AP) Officials mistakenly sent a warning of an imminent missile attack, promising \u201cTHIS IS NOT A DRILL,\u201d to cellphones, radios and televisions on Jan. 13.\u00a0Hanabusa used the false alarm as a key campaign cudgel against Ige. But the governor's handling of the Kilauea volcano's latest eruption, which destroyed more than 700 homes and displaced thousands, as well as devastating flooding on Kauai, may have improved his stature. Also, Ron Curtis will face off against incumbent Sen. Mazie Hirono in the general election as the Republican Party's nominee to represent Hawaii in the U.S. Senate. Hirono, who was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and became the first Asian-American female senator, is widely expected to win in November. Other primary vote-tally updates In Washington State, there was some good news for Democrats: It's looking more likely that the race for Washington's 9th Congressional District will have two Democrats on the ballot in November, as votes continue to be counted from last week's primary. WATCH: WASHINGTON CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE AIMS TO BE THE NEXT OCASIO-CORTEZ After King and Pierce Counties updated their ballot counts Friday night, Democrat Sarah Smith was 2,582 votes ahead of Republican Doug Basler, a significant jump from her 196-vote lead the day before. If her lead holds, she'll advance along with Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, who has represented the progressive district that includes part of Seattle for more than two decades. Adam Smith, the heavy favorite in November, secured about 49.3 percent of the vote, compared to Sarah Smith's 25.5 percent. Under Washington's primary system, all candidates appear on the same ballot and the top two vote getters advance to the general election, regardless of party. Washington is a vote-by-mail state and elections officials will continue tallying ballots next week. Sarah Smith was recruited to run by Brand New Congress, the same group that backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in New York's Democratic primary this summer. Also in Washington, another race where votes were still being tallied is the 8th Congressional District, where Democrat Kim Schrier is maintaining her lead for the second spot in hopes of advancing to the general election. Schrier, a pediatrician, increased her lead in updated returns Friday over attorney Jason Rittereiser. Republican Dino Rossi, a former state lawmaker who had unsuccessful runs for governor and the U.S. Senate, advanced Tuesday to the November election. KOBACH RECUSES HIMSELF IN KANSAS AS VOTE-COUNTING CONTINUES IN TIGHTH RACE The two are seeking the seat left open by long-time incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert, who is retiring. The seat has been held by Republicans since it was created in the early 1980s. The district is among about two dozen across the country that are held by Republicans but whose voters chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, making it a critical potential pickup for the Democrats trying to gain control of the House for the first time since 2010. And in Kansas, the counting of the last ballots in the tight and contentious Republican primary for governor will stretch out over the next week and still might not settle the race. Trump-backed Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach leads Gov. Jeff Colyer by 110 votes out of 313,000-plus cast after late mail-in ballots from all 105 counties were added Friday to totals from advance voting and ballots cast at the polls Tuesday. The state's 105 counties still must review nearly 9,000 provisional ballots and determine how many of them were cast in the Republican primary \u2014 and how many will be counted. They have until Aug. 20 to finish that process and certify their local results. Fox News' Amy Lieu and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Miami Herald has endorsed Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera, a Republican, for Congress. (Courtesy of Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera campaign) A major newspaper thinks Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera, a House candidate in Florida, is out of this world. The Miami Herald has endorsed Rodriguez Aguilera, a Republican vying to replace outgoing Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in Florida\u2019s 27th congressional district. The candidate, a former Doral councilwoman, made headlines after she claimed she was visited by extraterrestrials \u2013 which she\u2019s described as appearing like women with long, blonde hair \u2013 when she was 7 years old. She previously told the Miami Herald that these aliens have communicated with her multiple times throughout her life. The aliens took her into their spaceship and spoke to her about events that would happen, Rodriguez Aguilera has said. She\u2019s also spoken about these supposed events with several Spanish-language news outlets. \u201cWe realize that Rodriguez Aguilera is an unusual candidate,\u201d the Miami Herald said in its endorsement of her, adding that it agrees with Rodriguez Aguilera that her experiences are \u201ca non-issue.\u201d FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS HEADQUARTERS \u201cHer bona fides as a former elected official, and now a businesswoman who spends time in other countries training women to run for office are solid,\u201d the Miami Herald said. Born in Cuba, Rodriguez Aguilera has served as an advocate for human rights, including before the United Nations in Switzerland. Her father was a political prisoner in Cuba, and she was not able to see him until she was 17, she has said. In its endorsement, the Miami Herald editorial board pointed out that Rodriguez Aguilera is the only candidate who has a \u201cworking class agenda.\u201d Her platform includes: lowering student loan payments, reducing and eliminating tolls, fixing the credit score system, cutting taxes and implementing a hardship rental insurance to help with homelessness. FLORIDA HOUSE CANDIDATE WHO LIED ABOUT COLLEGE GRADUATION DROPS OUT OF RACE Rodriguez Aguilera was a social worker for Miami-Dade County before becoming an ombudsman in the county manager\u2019s office. She is an advocate for women in business and has worked\u00a0with efforts to help political prisoners in China, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, according to her campaign website. She's also spent some time in Albania and has supported\u00a0\u00a0nongovernmental organization aimed at combating domestic violence. Rodriguez Aguilera isn\u2019t the only candidate in this year\u2019s midterm elections to have an extraterrestrial connection. Joe Manchik, the Green Party candidate who ran in the tight Ohio special House election where Republican Troy Balderson claimed victory, has said his \u201cdistant relatives originally came to planet Earth from a planet orbiting a star.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi speaks after Democrats gain control of the House of Representatives. After a grueling and vexing past 18 months, Democrats have emerged triumphant in House races nationwide, picking up more than the necessary seats to regain control of the House. Early results were indeed concerning with Amy McGrath losing Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District and Senator Joe Donnelly losing his seat in Indiana. Further, President Trump\u2019s support of Senators-elect Hawley in Missouri and Braun in Indiana was fundamental in consolidating the Republican base and ultimately winning the midterm over the electorate in each statewide race. DOUG SCHOEN: DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE A PROBLEM That said, significant pick-ups down our nation\u2019s Eastern coast, with tremendous Democratic wins in traditionally Republican districts, especially New York\u2019s 11th district on Staten Island and Brooklyn with U.S. Army veteran Max Rose defeating Rep. Dan Donovan, former U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Mikie Sherrill defeating Senate Assemblyman Jay Webber in northern New Jersey\u2019s 11Th district, and retired Navy Commander Elaine Luria defeating Republican incumbent Scott Taylor in Virginia\u2019s 2nd district, made clear the Democratic enthusiasm, particularly that toward women, were growing. In addition, we saw very important Democratic gains in the Midwest with Democrat Dean Phillips defeating incumbent representative Erik Paulsen in Minnesota\u2019s 3rd Congressional district and Illinois 13th district going for Betsy Londrigan over incumbent Rodney Davis. These districts continue to show the evident trend among college-educated suburban voters that they are disheartened by President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and are looking for a check on his presidential power. Suburban voters have issued a statement on the first half of the Trump presidency. These voters have shown that they disapprove of President Trump and that they prefer that our country move in a more consistent, strategic, and positive direction. In this way, I would argue that suburban voters have issued a statement on the first half of the Trump presidency. These voters have shown that they disapprove of President Trump and that they prefer that our country move in a more consistent, strategic, and positive direction than what President Trump and the Congressional Republicans have done, if not failed to offer, in the past year and a half. This interest in change persists in districts like Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional district with Abigail Spanberger\u2019s too close to call race with David Brat, the same man who defeated Senate Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary in 2014 by running to Cantor\u2019s right. And in Illinois 6th Congressional district, Republican incumbent Peter Roskam fell to Democratic challenger Sean Casten in another race where educated suburban voters rejected President Trump\u2019s agenda and voted with a moderate, Democratic alternative. In upstate New York, two districts that are also traditionally red also swung towards the Democrats. In New York\u2019s 19th and 22nd Congressional districts, Antonia Delgado and Alex Brindisi, respectively, both defeated their Republican incumbents. While many would think this could be a time for Democrats to advance a progressive agenda, it is now more important than ever for our two major political parties to make compromises that move our country forward. Democrats must take this newly gained leadership as an opportunity to unite the country and stifle the division that has hurt this country for the past two years. What\u2019s also evident from this election is that the Republicans will build on their majority in the Senate. The Democratic minority\u00a0must find ways to support bipartisan policies, especially essential health care reforms, new infrastructure plans, and a middle-class tax policy that moves our economy forward, rather than hand out the greatest benefits to special interests. Based on the results we see this week, what is arguably most important is winning back the governorships in at least two critical states in the Midwest that are essential to Democratic fortunes in the future, especially in presidential years. Those are Michigan and Illinois. J.D. Pritzker\u2019s win in Illinois affirms that a Democratic pro-business, pro-reform agenda can succeed. Additionally, Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s moderate-centrist path to victory in Michigan outlines the way in which Democratic candidates can find victory nationwide. Whitmer ran as a pragmatic, problem-solving Democrat, who in her own words, vowed to \u201cfix the damn roads,\u201d and sought to fix health care policy for her constituents who otherwise found themselves struggling to both understand and afford premiums under the Obamacare program. \u00a0To them, Whitmer\u2019s both candidacy and victory symbolizes a fix to this type of system which is seen in man, if not dozens of states, nationwide. Indeed, a swing towards centrist-Democrats was observed in the rust-belt states and throughout the Midwest, which Trump largely swept in 2016, with a number of moderate Democratic candidates from Pennsylvania and Michigan succeeding across the board in flipping previously red districts. Namely, Michigan\u2019s 11th congressional district and Pennsylvania\u2019s 6th and 8th all saw Democrats solidly win. Furthermore, the power of a centrist agenda was observed in the Democratic victories in several key House races in Minnesota\u2019s 3rd district which elected President Trump just two years ago. In sum, Democrats who ran on a moderate, centrist platform not only saw their numbers improve in a number of House seats, but also enabled the Party to flip several once Republican governorships. Ultimately, what won the day for Democrats were the moderate messages and centrist campaigns that disavowed Nancy Pelosi and provided compelling alternatives to Republican policies. In this same vein, it would be a cataclysmic error to make Nancy Pelosi the next speaker of the House. Democrats must take this newly gained leadership as an opportunity to unite the country and stifle the division that has hurt this country for the past two years. Democrats\u2019 first order of business must be to move forward on a bipartisan infrastructure package that has been discussed in recent days and as far back as Trump\u2019s first days in office.

            "article_content": "Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley delighted by the president's endorsement in Missouri. Josh Hawley, the Missouri Republican looking to unseat U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill in November, slammed the Democratic incumbent for opposing the 2020 U.S. Census question inquiring about\u00a0citizenship status, saying McCaskill wants to give more power to California. \u201cSen. McCaskill would love to give more representation to California. That\u2019s what will happen,\u201d Hawley, the state attorney general, said in an interview with the Washington Times. He asserted that McCaskill's\u00a0aversion to the census question shows she\u2019s beholden to the Democratic Party rather than her constituents in the Show Me State. \u201cPlaces like California and New York that have greater numbers of illegal immigrants, they are going to end up with more representation, and we\u2019ll lose seats. She is fine with that, though,\u201d he added. \u201cThat just strikes people in Missouri as craziness. They just don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d \"Places like California and New York that have greater numbers of illegal immigrants, they are going to end up with more representation, and we\u2019ll lose seats. She is fine with that, though.\" CENSUS RESPONDENTS MAY BE ASKED CITIZENSHIP STATUS IN 2020 SURVEY The move to quiz U.S. residents on their citizenship status is a controversial one, dividing Washington along partisan lines. The Supreme Court will ultimately decide\u00a0whether the question will appear on the census. The citizenship\u00a0question is controversial because House seats are apportioned by population, which includes everyone counted by the census. But critics say\u00a0it would reduce the response rates by illegal immigrants who fear their information could be used to deport them. McCaskill herself criticized\u00a0the proposal, calling it\u00a0\u201cblatantly political\u201d and demanding a Senate panel\u00a0hearing on the issue. Republicans, meanwhile, said the citizen question is important to get a clear picture of the U.S. makeup. VULNERABLE DEMS MCCASKILL, SINEMA TO ATTEND FUNDRAISER THROWN BY DONOR WHO CALLED TRUMP SUPPORTERS 'TRAITORS,' 'LOW IQ' The issue fits well into Hawley\u2019s campaign to unseat McCaskill in a red state. He portrayed the Democrat as a pawn of the Democratic Party rather than the independent senator she often claims to be. The Republican criticized McCaskill\u2019s \u201cno\u201d vote on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, saying the vote proves she\u2019s following her party\u2019s \u201cextreme agenda.\u201d \u201cBlock conservative judges, throw open our borders, raise taxes on the middle class. That is their agenda,\u201d he told the Washington Times. \u201cThey are hungry for power, and they will do just about anything to get it. \u201cThat, versus the agenda that this state voted for in 2016, which is to rebuild this country. It is a stark choice and that choice is on the ballot,\u201d he added. The race between Hawley and McCaskill is in a dead heat, with the latest poll showing the Republican leading by 1 point. McCaskill\u2019s campaign didn't respond to Fox News' request for a comment.",

            "article_content": "Aug. 20, 2012: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, left, and vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. (AP) Make no mistake, Mitt Romney\u2019s appointment of Paul Ryan as his running mate has galvanized the Republican base. But while a recent Gallup poll found a mere 39% of Democrats are now more enthusiastic about voting than in previous elections -- down from 61% in 2008 and 68% in 2004 \u2013 this enthusiasm gap has not translated into a significant bounce for Mr. Romney in the polls. Mitt Romney currently leads by two points in the most recent Gallup polling (45% for Obama to \u00a047% for Romney) and by one point in the latest polling by Rasmussen Reports (43% for Obama just 44% Romney). This is a below-average \u201cbounce\u201d for the selection of a vice presidential candidate; in past elections, the bounce has averaged in the neighborhood of 4 percentage points instead.\u201d [pullquote] What it suggests is that a campaign platform that focuses primarily on the budget, Medicare, and entitlement reform is a losing strategy that is hurting them with seniors, women, and the independent swing voters whose support will be necessary this November. The Obama campaign has launched a series of attack ads in key swing states which focus on the Ryan Plan \u2013 going after \u00a0Ryan\u2019s plan for deep cuts in Medicare, the nation\u2019s most popular social program after Social Security\u2013 to further undermine Romney\u2019s effort to win these core constituencies. Meanwhile, the Romney campaign has yet to lay out a convincing argument for what their election holds in benefit for working people. If Mr. Romney hopes to win over these voters before Election Day, he must present a specific plan to revive the economy with a jobs and economic growth strategy for the working and middle class. Recent polling confirms that voters have a highly pessimistic outlook on the state of the economy and the state of the nation. According to a Gallup survey released last week, just 36% of Americans approve of Mr. Obama's handling of the economy. Thirty-seven percent approve of his record on job creation. And only 30% are happy with the president's handling of the federal budget deficit. Indeed, as the Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cilizza pointed out: \u00a0should Obama win a second term on November 6, he will have defied history, becoming the first sitting president since World War II to win reelection with the unemployment rate above 7.2 percent. With unemployment (8.3%) above 8 percent for the 8th consecutive month, it is no wonder a new Gallup poll finds 75 percent of us \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the direction of the country, while a recent CNN survey found that that twice as many Americans (39%-19%) think the economy is still in a recession than think it recovering. To be sure, \u00a0when it comes to jobs and the economy, voters view Governor Romney as the lesser of two evils. The two sides may fight to a draw on Medicare and entitlements, but a Romney-Ryan ticket cannot simply promote a plan to transform Medicare into a voucher system while slashing other programs for the middle class and poor without frank recognition that many Americans are still struggling and rely on the social safety net. Put simply, if the Romney-Ryan ticket hopes to significantly improve its standing and build support with key swing voting groups, they will need a pro-growth fiscally responsible agenda emphasizing job creation at its core.",

            "article_content": "After an 18-month investigation into the FBI and DOJ\u2019s Hillary Clinton probe, the highly anticipated report from the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General Michael Horowitz is out. Here\u2019s a look at the three biggest takeaways. An unidentified FBI employee described Trump voters as \"uneducated\" and \"lazy POS\" the day after the 2016 presidential election, according to the Justice Department watchdog's bombshell report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The employee was responding to instant messages from \"FBI Attorney 2,\" whom DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz indicated was one of five FBI employees who had been referred for investigation and possible disciplinary action over politically charged messages. Horowitz said Attorney 2 had been assigned to the Clinton investigation \"early in 2016.\" Approximately one year later, the report said Attorney 2 was made the \"primary FBI attorney\" assigned to the Russia investigation. IG REFERS FIVE FBI EMPLOYEES FOR INVESTIGATION, AS MORE ANTI-TRUMP MESSAGES REVEALED On the morning of Nov. 9, 2016, Attorney 2 messaged the employee: \"I am so stressed about what I could have done differently.\" The employee answered: \"Don't stress. None of that mattered,\" an apparent reference to the FBI's investigation of Clinton. When the attorney said: \"I don\u2019t know. We broke the momentum,\" the employee answered: \"That is not so.\" \"All the people who were initially voting for her would not, and were not, swayed by any decision the FBI put out,\" the employee wrote. \"Trump\u2019s supporters are all poor to middle class, uneducated, lazy POS that think he will magically grant them jobs for doing nothing. They probably didn't watch the debates, aren't fully educated on his policies, and are stupidly wrapped up in his unmerited enthusiasm.\" \"POS\" is an acronym that typically means \"piece[s] of s---.\" \"Attorney 2\" later messaged the employee: \"I'm just devastated. I can't wait until I can leave today and just shut off the world for the next four days.\" He later added: \"I just can't imagine the systematic disassembly of the progress we made over the last 8 years. [The Affordable Care Act] is gone. Who knows if the rhetoric about deporting people, walls, and crap is true. I honestly feel like there is going to be a lot more gun issues, too, the crazies won finally. This is the tea party on steroids. And the GOP is going to be lost, they have to deal with an incumbent in 4 years. We have to fight this again. Also [Vice President Mike] Pence is stupid.\" When asked about the messages, \"Attorney 2\" said the two were \"just discussing our personal feelings ... between friends.\" He also told the watchdog that the \"so stressed about what I could have done differently\" message referred to the length of time investigators took to examine Clinton emails found on former Congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop. \"[I]f we would have opened a few weeks earlier, as opposed to at that time, two weeks before the election, I think it, you know, it would have given more time for the FBI\u2019s actions and, and required and, and necessary investigation to, to occur to allow the, the public a chance to make their own [decisions].\" The Nov. 9 exchange of messages was one of three that Horowitz flagged as raising \"concerns of potential bias\" on the part of \"Attorney 2.\" Another exchange took place on Oct. 28, 2016, the day then-FBI Director James Comey notified Congress that he was reopening the Clinton email investigation after emails were found on Weiner's laptop. According to Horowitz, the attorney send messages to four separate FBI employees that referred to Comey's letter as \"the destruction of the Republic.\" \"I mean, I never really liked the Republic anyway,\" the attorney messaged two different FBI employees, while a message to a third read: \"As I have initiated the destruction of the republic.... Would you be so kind as to have a coffee with me this afternoon?\" A fourth message read: \"I'm clinging to small pockets of happiness in the dark time of the Republic\u2019s destruction.\" When questioned by the inspector general's office, Attorney 2 described the language in the Oct. 28 messages as \"hyperbolic\" and \"off-the cuff commentary to friends.\" He also denied that his \"personal political feelings or beliefs\" played any role in his work on the Clinton or Russia investigation.",

            "article_content": "Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum wins Florida Democratic gubernatorial primary. Ed Henry reports. The first test of the 2020 race for the White House \u2013 and of the possible impeachment of President Trump before he can even run for re-election \u2013 will come this November in the Florida election for governor. In the Florida primary Tuesday, voters selected Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis as the gubernatorial candidates of their respective parties. Gillum won an upset victory over three better-funded Democratic candidates, while DeSantis captured the Republican nomination with the help of an endorsement from President Trump. The outcome of the Gillum-DeSantis race \u2013 between candidates who are polar opposites in many ways \u2013 will be a profound indicator of three things: how the American people feel about the policies of President Trump; what they think of the possibility of impeaching him; and how they may vote in the next presidential election if Trump is on the ballot. Gillum explicitly supports impeachment of President Trump, and is expected continue calling for it on the campaign trail \u2013 even though governors have no role in the impeachment process. In contrast, DeSantis has been one of President Trump\u2019s fiercest and most visible advocates in the House of Representatives. There couldn\u2019t be a clearer contest between pro-Trump and anti-Trump candidates. Gillum is a devout progressive. He supports abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). He favors the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sander, I-Vt. And he favors raising the corporate tax rate to pay for increased education funding. DeSantis is a disciple of the Trump \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda and regularly defends the president against criticism. He has been a strong opponent of the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign or Trump himself. Gillum ran with the enthusiastic support of Bernie Sanders, as well as funding from prominent left-wing Democrats George Soros and Tom Steyer. Steyer has become a familiar face to millions of Americans through appearances in TV ads he is funding calling for President Trump\u2019s impeachment. DeSantis probably owes his primary victory to the strong endorsement he received from President Trump. If Gillum becomes governor in Florida and Democrats win majority control of the U.S. House in the midterm elections, his victory almost certainly means the Democrats will lose whatever inhibitions they may have about impeaching the president. One thing is certain: The Gillum-DeSantis race will be bitter, hard fought, and expensive \u2013 costing millions of dollars. There is one other issue that is raised by Gillum\u2019s nomination, along with the nomination of Stacey Abrams in the race for governor of Georgia. For the first time, Democrats are running two progressive African-Americans in the South who have consciously avoided tacking to the center. The hypothesis that both Gillum and Abrams have embraced is that moving to the center would not get them as many votes as their strong advocacy of a progressive agenda will bring. Both candidates believe that the election will ultimately be about the mobilization of core Democratic constituencies \u2013 minorities, women, and working-class whites who feel economically left behind, despite President Trump\u2019s election. To be sure, the Florida primary has gotten a lot of attention because of the nominations of DeSantis and Gillum. Nonetheless, it needs to be seen for what it is: a proxy for the 2020 presidential race; a proxy for the impeachment fight that is likely to come if Democrats win control of the House; and a referendum on whether a new approach to politics will work for the Democratic Party. The new approach \u2013 being taken by Gillum and also Abrams in Georgia and some Democrats in other states \u2013 eschews moderation and emphasizes advocacy of strongly progressive positions. Will this new approach win competitive races for Democratic candidates around the country? Or will Gillum, Abrams and other progressives go down to defeat because they don\u2019t appeal to moderate Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans? We\u2019ll have to wait for the Nov. 6 midterm elections to find out.",

            "article_content": "Both sides score points, depending on the target. Whom can we blame? How will it play in November? For the second time in a week, those were the crass calculations running through the minds of the political class. First it was\u00a0the pipe bombs\u00a0and now it is the\u00a0Pittsburgh synagogue massacre. In both cases, the instant assumption was that the allegiance of the perpetrator would determine which side would be punished in the midterms and which side would reap the benefits of sympathy. If this sounds heartless and ghoulish, welcome to America. The politicization of everything is exacting a terrible price on our country, with no crime or tragedy too heinous to exploit. As the number of pipe bombs grew and it became clear that all the targets were Democrats or fierce critics of President Trump, most fingers pointed in the obvious direction. Much of the media rushed to blame the president, and Dem congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi piled on, even denouncing Trump\u2019s call for national unity. \u201cTime and time again, the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions,\u201d they said in a statement that was remarkably harsh and partisan given that the suspect was still at large and fear was growing by the day. Meanwhile, the pattern of targets was too obvious for some in the president\u2019s corner, and they smelled a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation. They suspected the bombs were a plant by the left to put the blame on Trump and swing the coming election to the Dems. But now that we know that suspect Cesar Sayoc, 56, is\u00a0indeed a Trump supporter, we are back to the original assumptions. Phrases such as \u201cMAGA Bomber\u201d and \u201cNative American Trump Supporter\u201d who drove a \u201cTrump Mobile\u201d convey the tone of most of the media, with some coverage veering into a \u201cwe told you so\u201d smugness. For the 1 millionth time, they were sure this would be the final straw in his popularity. Happy days would soon be here again. And then came Saturday\u2019s slaughter, which scrambles the political playbook because it defies easy assumptions about the fallout. Suspect Robert Bowers is a\u00a0sick anti-Semite, the carrier of a disease nearly as old as mankind. Because of that, he is no fan of Trump, as he has said on \u00adsocial-media posts. For Bowers, Jews are the everything, the sole measuring rod of all things, which makes Trump part of the problem. The president, after all, is a strong supporter of Israel and his daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism to marry Jared Kushner. The fact that Trump also dared to criticize white nationalists after the Charlottesville, Va., incident is proof he cannot be trusted, according to Bowers\u2019 Nazi-like rants. Voters have a mind of their own.\u00a0Thank God for that. Still, that distinction may be buried in the rush to gain an edge, and the anti-Trumpers may be correct that the horrors will persuade enough voters in key districts and states that the president is to blame for the rise of political violence. In that case, Dems could sweep both houses and turn Trump into a pi\u00f1ata for the next two years, assuming he isn\u2019t impeached and convicted before his term expires. So a bandwagon of belief is rolling in that direction, but nobody need save me a seat. I\u2019m not convinced the bomb suspect\u2019s support for Trump will swing the election or that the synagogue attack helps Democrats. Here are three main reasons for my doubts. First, neither suspect was a solid citizen who suddenly turned to violence because of politics. Sayoc is a career criminal whose arrest record goes back three decades, including at least one charge for making terroristic threats. A recent former employer described him as \u201ccrazed\u201d but not about politics. He was, as The Post put it in a headline, a \u201cstripper with a steroid problem.\u201d Bowers, based on what we know of him so far, is a freak of the fringe who would not be welcomed in any mainstream political party. His vileness isn\u2019t partisan. Although the public in general is distressed with gutter-level politics, and most feel Trump makes too many inflammatory comments, it doesn\u2019t automatically follow that these two alleged criminals can be successfully pinned on the president. Just as most Americans did not blame Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot Republican Congressman Steve Scalise in a planned assassination attempt last year, most are more likely to believe Sayoc and Bowers are responsible for their own actions. Second, the speed of events these days means no one storyline dominates for long, even in the anti-Trump-obsessed media. The Brett Kavanaugh confirmation battle looked as if it would determine the election \u2014 until the\u00a0caravan of Central American immigrants making their way toward the southern border\u00a0vowed to get into the country, one way or another. Both events galvanized GOP voters and quashed most predictions of a blue wave. While it\u2019s clear the media and Democrats will try to reverse the trend by hanging Sayoc and Bowers around Trump\u2019s neck, that approach probably will work only with those already opposed to Trump. Besides, the president\u2019s supporters can \u2014 and already are \u2014 pointing to left-wing violence by antifa and comments by Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, Maxine Waters and other Dems urging an uncivil campaign of harassment against Republicans. And The New York Times didn\u2019t help the left\u2019s cause with its outrageous publication of an article that fantasizes about an assassination of the president. Shamefully, the Gray Lady\u2019s demand for civility doesn\u2019t extend to its own conduct. The economy is the third reason for my doubts that last week will dramatically reshape the election. Most Americans in the workforce today have never seen anything like the jobs boom and the rising incomes that go with historic low unemployment. To most voters, kitchen-table issues almost always outweigh headline-grabbing incidents, even horrible ones, a fact often lost on elite bubble dwellers. The media especially continue to fall hard for the illusion that the public trusts them to decide what matters most. In short, I\u2019m having that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu feeling all over again. Much as they were in 2016, too many know-it-alls are 100 percent certain about which way the wind will blow on Nov. 6. The skeptic in me suspects they still are confusing facts with their own bias. My only certainty now is the same one I had two years ago: Voters have a mind of their own. Thank God for that.",

            "article_content": " Former President Obama gave the nation some insights into the Democratic Party\u2019s midterm election strategy Friday with a political speech demonizing Americans who elected Donald Trump as president and doubling down on the failed liberal ideology that devastated our economy. In a moment reminiscent of Hillary Clinton\u2019s outrageous characterization of Trump voters as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cirredeemable,\u201d President Obama said: \u201cI have to say this \u2026 Over the past few decades, the politics of division and resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party.\u201d Labeling the 63 million Trump voters as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d didn\u2019t work out for Hillary Clinton when she ran a failed presidential campaign against Trump in 2016. Labeling the same voters as divisive, resentful and paranoid will not work for Democrats in the November midterm elections. Democrats continually demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding and active demonization of Trump voters. They are clearly wrong but don\u2019t realize they\u2019re wrong. I traveled the country in search of the Trump voter for my book, \u201cThe New American Revolution: The Making of a Populist Movement.\u201d Here is what I found: a mother who lost her only son to an illegal immigrant; a wife whose husband died while languishing on a waitlist for health-care from the Department of Veterans Affairs; a mom whose entire family perished in a terrorist attack; factory workers whose jobs went overseas; and so many other great Americans who wanted change \u2013 a change from the Obama presidency. These are some of the millions of Americans who made Donald Trump our president in an election that the liberal media, pollsters, and political elite never saw coming. They never saw it coming because they never took the time to talk to voters and understand their one simple request: \u201cchange.\u201d As I wrote previously: \u201cIn every single one of the twenty-seven states where CNN conducted exit and entrance polls during the Republican primaries, more than 80% of the Republican electorate felt angry or dissatisfied with the federal government. In total, just shy of 90% of Republican voters overall expressed a negative view of the federal government.\u201d In the states where CNN asked the same question of Democrats, an average 61 percent of Democratic voters had a negative view of the federal government! Interestingly, the highest level of Democratic frustration was in the state of Michigan, where 69 percent of voters reported frustration with the federal government. Michigan, of course, voted for Trump after 30 years of going blue. Election night exit polling once again confirmed voters\u2019 appetite for change. Fox News 2016 exit polling found that a staggering 62 percent of voters thought the country was \u201cseriously on the wrong track.\u201d In short, the story of the 2016 election was a bipartisan call for change from the failed Obama status quo. So why, then, are Democrats bringing President Obama to the campaign trail? The Obama presidency delivered the slowest economic recovery since World War II. Economic growth languished at 2 percent each year; wage growth stalled; and the middle class shrank considerably. Perhaps it should come as no surprise then that 71 percent of Americans believed the economy was rigged against them. In just two years, President Trump completely reversed course. Now, 85 percent of blue collar workers say their lives are \u201cheading in the right direction,\u201d and 62 percent of voters overall say the economy is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d\u00a0 The Trump economy has delivered 4.2 percent annualized economic growth in the second quarter; 3.6 million new jobs; and wages growing at the fastest pace in a decade. Now, President Obama is desperately trying to take credit for President Trump\u2019s successes, saying \u201cremember when this recovery started\u201d while conveniently failing to note the Obama recovery was the worst since World War II, costing Americans approximately $17,000 in wage growth. Make no mistake. The windfall of good economic news is precisely because of the Trump presidency reversing Obama\u2019s legacy of high taxes, onerous regulation and job-killing trade deals. It\u2019s why \u201cEconomists Credit Trump as Tailwind for U.S. Growth, Hiring and Stocks,\u201d according to a Wall Street Journal survey. Returning to the status quo political class that oversaw a failing economy is not the answer for Democrats. Sending Obama out on the campaign trail forces every single red state Democrat to defend the failures of the Obama presidency. Obama\u2019s presence poses quite a challenge for Democrats like North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who pose as Trump allies while saying Obama will not be welcome to their states. Obama\u2019s disastrous liberal agenda was rejected in 2016, and it must be rejected in 2018. While Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats ignored the forgotten men and women of this country, President Trump spoke to them. Now, he is acting for them.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"The Story with Martha MacCallum,\" October 2, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, ANCHOR: Good evening, John. Thanks. So, Senator Jeff Flake has been on a bit of a media tour and ask every step of the way how he is going to vote. Did he tip his hand with this comment? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JEFF FLAKE, R-ARIZ.: The interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me. And I tell myself, you give a little leeway because of what he has been through. But, on the other hand, we can't have this on the court. We simply can't. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That put Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell in a bit of a test spot tonight. Essentially walking a tightrope with the so-called gang of three as he tries to hold his vote together. Senator Flake, Collins, and Murkowski is just one wavers in their support. The question is will they all go with that person? Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. And this continues to be the lead story tonight with brand-new developments this evening. Later, when Jeff Flake was pressed about those remarks, he walked it back a bit. Telling the Atlantic, \"I didn't say that. I wasn't referring to Judge Kavanaugh.\" Implying that he was criticizing the overall process. Brit Hume here in a moment on that, and the New York Times coverage of the so-called a bar fight and the ice throwing as the reporting on this story pushes the norms of good journalism. But first, Fox News chief national correspondent Ed Henry with the very new developments on all of this tonight good evening, Ed. ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Martha, great to see you. \u00a0Breaking tonight, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is now telling Senators in both parties, expect a report from the FBI very soon. All 100 Senators will get a copy. Have time to review it, but then, he is steaming ahead with an up or down vote he says this week. And that may be because of what we've just learned moments ago, that this FBI report could be delivered to the White House as soon as tomorrow, that from our colleague John Roberts. Dr. Ford's legal team has just fired off a letter to the FBI demanding that they talk to the agency. But sources are telling us she and Kavanaugh may not be interviewed because they've already given hours of testimony. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer who opposed Kavanaugh even before any of these allegations came out, complained today about this moving too fast. Claimed his side was blocked from a call with the White House counsel about the scope of the FBI probe. Republicans say that's false. He also raised eyebrows by saying, \"If Democrats take back the majority he'll look at raising the threshold for Supreme Court nominations back to 60 votes. When remember, it was Harry Reid who lowered it to 51. Schumer, knows moderate Democrats are now on the griddle. Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota now trailing her Republican opponent one poll by 10 points in North Dakota. A poll by the conservative Judicial Crisis Network found 56 percent of North Dakotans want Kavanaugh confirmed. While in West Virginia, Democrat Joe Manchin has to deal with the fact that the same conservative poll found 58 percent of voters in his state want a yes vote on Kavanaugh. But, two key moderate Republicans, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski who haven't run into one another on an elevator as reporters swarm them today are not tipping their hands. That's why Jeff Flakes vote is so critical. \u00a0He did say today he understands why someone who thinks they've been falsely accused would lash out. But then, he said it was a mistake for Kavanaugh to get so combative and that troubles him because he said the Supreme Court is one of the last institutions Americans have faith in. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FLAKE: I was very troubled by the tone of the -- of the remarks. The initial defense that Judge Kavanaugh gave was something like I told my wife, I hoped that I would sound that indignant if I were -- if I felt that I was unjustly -- you know, maligned. But then it went on. (END VIDEO CLIP) HENRY: But, if the FBI finds nothing new, remember, what Flake's said Friday morning, \"Our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence of the accused, absent corroborating evidence. That is what binds us,\" he said, \"to the rule of law. While some may argue a different standard should apply regarding the Senate's advice and consent. I believe that the constitution provisions of fairness and due process apply as well, I will vote.\" Remember Flake, said then to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. So, if the FBI, Martha, finds no corroborating evidence for any of these allegations, it will be a remarkable flip-flop for Flake to suddenly suggest the presumption of innocence is less important. Martha. MACCALLUM: Good point. Ed, thank you very much. Here now with more, Brit Hume, Fox News senior political analyst. Brit, good evening to you. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS: Hi, Martha. MACCALLUM: It sort of feels like we've -- you know, gone along rot for a ride with Jeff Flake on his every thought process as he has worked through all of this, he's been speaking out quite a bit in recent days. Do you think he's showing his cards? HUME: I don't think he's moved at all, Martha. I think he's back exactly where he was. He committed to vote for this nomination pending the FBI investigation. I think that's where he is now. I -- look, if he's troubled, as he says he is by the nominees conduct in that hearing the other day. In which he said he would get he cut him some slack on anyway. \u00a0He might want to look at his record as 12 years -- of 12 years as a judge on the bench. He probably has, in fact. And I'm sure he would agree with that there have been no criticism of his judicial temperament as an actual judge. MACCALLUM: Yes. HUME: Rather than a nominee under withering fire for vile crimes and being called evil. MACCALLUM: But, what do you think about the fact that -- you know, there's a lot of criticism of Brett Kavanaugh for becoming too partisan in his remarks. Hillary Clinton is now speaking out of it. It seems like the goalposts are moving to take a look more at the temperament than the original thing that Brett Kavanaugh was accused of. And here's what she said. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: For anyone who believes there's such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues, approach plaintiffs and defendants with a sense of fairness, that there's a lot to be concerned about. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Brit. HUME: Well, yes, that's the new talking point, isn't it? Because it appears that the Blasey Ford allegations are receding. The Swetnick allegations appear to almost totally collapsed, the Ramirez allegations remain utterly unverified. And so, here we are with something additional. And you know, think of it this way. That was a sequence of events. The nomination was made, the Democrats came out almost unanimously against it immediately before any hearings, before any inquiries of any kind. Then, during the course of the hearings that his record as a judge which you would think would be the most important thing when almost unremarked upon. No questions about it, no criticisms about it, none of that to speak of, almost nothing. Then, after the hearings were over, these unverified allegations leaked out. Not to mention, of course, the fact as I mentioned earlier that he'd been called evil by at least one Democrat on the Judiciary Committee -- three of whom, by the way. Also said, that the burden of proof was on him. And when he reacted in anger to all this, they said, \"Ah, you don't have proper judicial temperament.\" MACCALLUM: Yes. HUME: I mean, it -- you know, you look at it that way, you almost want to laugh at it. MACCALLUM: Yes, and I would imagine that if he sat there quietly taking it all, they would have said that he wasn't defending himself. HUME: Yes, bloodless. Exactly. MACCALLUM: And that, yes. That he wasn't -- you know, passionate real human being. HUME: Unconvincing, (INAUDIBLE), yes, saw it robotic. Right. MACCALLUM: I want to get your thoughts on this from McConnell. Mitch McConnell saying this about the New York Times story about Brett Kavanaugh possibly getting into a bar fight once in the 1980s. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY.: Last night, the New York Times unleashed this major story. Get this, Judge Kavanaugh may have been accused of throwing some ice across a college bar in the mid-1980s. \u00a0Talk about a bombshell. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I mean, Brit -- HUME: Well, it's so insignificant. And so -- and if it were to say all of it, were truly got into a fight you threw some ice at somebody in the 1980s when he was in college. Is that disqualifying? Please, not to mention the fact that The Times had to put out an editor's note later in the day or a statement by its P.R. representative that one of the people whose bylines is on that story is a woman named Emily Bazelon. She is a liberal activist, she's up at Yale and she came out on virtually the day that the Kavanaugh nomination was announced on Twitter and said that he must be resisted because he'd be a fifth vote to turn the Supreme Court hard to the right. So, she was a committed anti-Kavanaugh partisan. And here she is with writing stories for the New York Times about his nomination. The Times later said they see, we think we should have actually had one of the reporters do that, but there we are. MACCALLUM: There is that. Good idea. Brit, thank you. Great to see you tonight as always. HUME: You bet, Martha. You bet, thank you. MACCALLUM: So, sources telling Fox News that the new FBI report could be finished as soon as tomorrow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A lot is going to depend on what comes back from the FBI in terms of their additional number seven investigation. But, I think that Judge Kavanaugh is doing very well right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Joining me now in an exclusive interview is someone who actually worked on one of those vettings of Judge Kavanaugh, personally. \u00a0Kristi Remington has known Judge Kavanaugh for more than 20 years was involved in his fifth background investigation when he was appointed to the D.C. Circuit Court. Kristi, thank you very much for being here tonight. You know, what do you make of this timeframe in terms of what they had to do, they -- we know that they spoke with Deborah Ramirez at length and Mark Judge at length. Does it make sense to you that it could possibly wrap up as soon as tomorrow? KRISTI REMINGTON, PARTNER AT WEST FRONT STRATEGIES LLC: Certainly, he, as many people have said, he's been through six full-field background investigations. So, those investigations generally build on the previous one. And as the Senate had asked, it was this one would be very limited in scope. So, I can understand why it wouldn't take very long and if the FBI has many investigators that they can send out. MACCALLUM: I just want a bit of a quote from a Dr. Ford's legal team to the FBI today because they are upset that they have not been contacted in the course of this supplemental investigation. They say, \"It's inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr. Ford's allegations without interviewing her, Judge Kavanaugh, or the witnesses that we have identified in our letters to you. Your thoughts on that? REMINGTON: So, both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford testified extensively before the Senate under oath. So, I can understand why the FBI wouldn't feel the need to go back out to them. They had access to that testimony, presumably. MACCALLUM: So, a lot of what we're seeing in the interim in terms of new information that's kind of flooding the market here, includes a lot of -- you know, sort of really wild charges from a number of people that he went to high school or college with. We're also getting some handwritten information about Beach Week, we're back to Beach Week in 1983. And I just want to put this up on the screen. This is a note that reportedly he wrote -- Brett Kavanaugh wrote. But it says, it's signed by Bart. I don't know if that was a nickname. But it says, it would -- and is sort of informing all of his friends about the plan for Beach Week and he's outlining whatever one needs to bring and all of this stuff. And he says, \"We need to be careful because we don't want to get kicked out. P.S. it would probably be a good idea on Saturday, the 18th to warn the neighbors that were loud, obnoxious drunks with prolific pukers among us. Advise them to go about 30 miles and then it drifts off. Is this relevant in any way to you? REMINGTON: Normally, we draw a line when in these FBI investigations at the -- at their 18th birthday. And I think, at least, in judicial selection, what is most relevant to -- at least, in the Bush administration and the people who are reviewing the backgrounds of candidates is what they did as an adult. MACCALLUM: Right. REMINGTON: And how they've acted as an adult? What they've done as a lawyer? And in this case, what they've done as a judge? MACCALLUM: I mean, there's a lot of focus on proving that he's a sloppy drunk, is what we've heard a lot in the last 24 hours. Is that part of the original background checks that were done on him looking into alcohol behavior, those sorts of things? REMINGTON: Certainly, that is a standard question in every background investigation. They asked about alcohol use and drug use going back to your 18th birthday. MACCALLUM: Kristi, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. REMINGTON: Sure, thank you. MACCALLUM: So, this is a Fox News Alert: We have just learned that a letter suspected of containing poison ricin may have been meant to be sent to President Trump. New details after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Three separate envelopes suspected of containing ricin which is an extremely deadly poison were intercepted. And they were addressed to Secretary of Defense Mattis, top Navy Admiral John Richardson, and even President Trump himself. Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast Newsroom with the very latest on this tonight. Hi, Trace! TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS: Hi, Martha! The Secret Service is now confirming the last letter was addressed to President Trump but did not make it into the White House or near the White House. It was received and detected at a federal mail sorting facility yesterday but the Secret Service will not tell us at least yet which facility that was. The letter did contain the very same substance as two letters sent to the Pentagon yesterday and those letters tested positive for ricin. As you noted the first letters were addressed to Defense Secretary James Madison and Admiral John Richardson. He is the Chief of Naval Operations. \u00a0They were intercepted at a mail screening facility in the Pentagon compound but the envelopes did not enter the main Pentagon building. Tonight that mail facility remains under quarantine and there is still no word yet if all three letters are connected but they are being examined by FBI forensic teams. If you don't know, ricin is a naturally occurring substance that's found in castor beans but it takes a deliberate and precise act to turn them into biological weapons. It can either be used in the form of a powder, a pellet, a mist, or acid and it can be inhaled, injected, or ingested. \u00a0Experts say within 36 to 48 hours -- 48 hours it'll begin to shut down major organs. There is no antidote but you should know it's not always fatal and of course, children are more at risk than adults. Remember, in 2013 letters testing positive for ricin were addressed to a Mississippi Senator, a Mississippi Judge, and President Obama. All three envelopes were intercepted and the man who sent that letter is now in prison. And of course shortly after 9/11, letters containing anthrax were mailed to the offices of two senators and some media outlets, those threats also intercepted. As we find out more about this sorting facility that intercepted the letter intended for President Trump, we'll get back to you. \u00a0Martha? MACCALLUM: Trace, thank you very much. So also tonight we are just five short weeks now from the midterm elections and the fate of a few deep red state Senate Democrats could hinge on how they vote on Judge Kavanaugh. \u00a0It's a rock in a hard place. They either defy their liberal base or they alienate the Republican majority in their state. One of those on the bubble is North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp who will not commit at this point either way. She is now down six points to her GOP challenger Kevin Cramer. And in Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly who now wants to see the FBI report before he decides how he's going to vote. He has a two-point lead. He originally said he would vote no, then he said he would wait and see the FBI report and the numbers as well, no doubt. In Missouri critical swing vote Claire McCaskill is the virtual tie -- in a virtual tie with her Republican challenger Josh Hawley. And joining me now Guy Benson, Co-Host of \"BENSON & HARF\" in Fox News Radio and Fox News Contributor, Robert Zimmerman DNC Committee Member and Democratic Strategist. It's good to have all of you here. ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Good to be with you. MACCALLUM: Robert, let me start with you. What would you be advising Joe Donnelly at this point and Heidi Heitkamp? ZIMMERMAN: To vote for the interests of their state and represent their state, and that's what they're doing. I mean Claire McCaskill came out against Brett Kavanaugh because his decisions gave a clear path for more special interest unreported money into the political process. Jon Tester from Montana opposed Judge Kavanaugh because he was concerned about privacy issues. MACCALLUM: Yes, but you're talking about people who have already told us. \u00a0I'm talking about Donnelly and Heitkamp who have not decided. ZIMMERMAN: They have to -- they have to watch the FBI report and see what it says. They've got a look at his decisions and how it impacts their state. But the bottom line to the entire discussion is, this is not going to be the deciding factor in these states. The reason in these red states, Democrats are within the margin of error across the board is because of Donald Trump. The fact that according to the Fox News poll he is running at 30 or what, 35 percent believe he cares about people like them, and The Wall Street Journal poll showed that 53 percent including majority of Republicans want a check and balance on the President. MACCALLUM: So you're telling -- you are telling Heitkamp and Donnelly that they should vote no. ZIMMERMAN: I'm telling hard Karen Donnelly, look at his decisions. Look at what best -- serves their best interests of their state and cast a vote accordingly. And quite frankly, at the end of the day, that's -- MACCALLUM: So if they vote yes, are you OK with that? ZIMMERMAN: I respect their decision. But the point is, that's not going to decide this election politically. Donald Trump and his number as his numbers keep sinking and his credibility keeps falling, and his policy to keep failing, that's what's keeping them in the game. MACCALLUM: Sticking to the midterms here, guy. The President who does have some pretty good political instincts at times believes that this could be a real problem for these candidates if they don't vote yes. GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS: Certainly. So if you're Claire McCaskill, she was always going to vote no on Judge Kavanaugh. She was a no on Neil Gorsuch, she is a Liberal Democrat, far out-of-step I think with the majority of her state which went heavily for President Trump. She's going to try to squeak through here. I think this is a big problem for her and she knows it, but she's a committed liberal so she's going to vote no. MACCALLUM: Let me pause you for one second and bring up this Remington poll because it says, has the Supreme Court Confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh made you more likely to vote for Claire McCaskill or less. 42 percent of those said more likely, 49 percent said less likely. BENSON: Right. So she actually was pretty candid a few weeks ago and said this is a no-win political situation for me because of the dynamic that you talked about, alienating the left or turning off a lot of the more conservative voters of that state. But if you're Joe Manchin or you're Heidi Heitkamp, there are polls coming out of those states that have Kavanaugh after the hearing at plus 30, plus 35. I think unless something really significant comes out of the FBI investigation, you're going to see one or both of them vote yes -- ZIMMERMAN: But before the FBI investigation even was completed, let's remember, support for Judge Kavanaugh have dropped us such a record low. \u00a0He's the most unpopular nominee since Judge Bork. BENSON: Not on these states. ZIMMERMAN: let me really also make the point in many in these states amongst independents and women, important swing votes, they are not only walking away from Judge Kavanaugh and opposed to his nomination -- BENSON: No, they're not. ZIMMERMAN: They are walking away from Donald Trump and what he represents. \u00a0Look, I am more -- MACCALLUM: But I hear you -- ZIMMERMAN: Let me finish. Let me finish. MACCALLUM: We're talking -- we're talking very specific midterm politics here. ZIMMERMAN: I know we are. And I'm talking -- I'm talking very specific states. MACCALLUM: And Guy makes a great point because you're talking about a national poll on Kavanaugh and he's saying that in these states it will be politically dangerous for North Carolina -- ZIMMERMAN: No Martha, let me finish my point. You see Democrats -- MACCALLUM: \u00a0-- or I'm sorry, in North Dakota or West Virginia. ZIMMERMAN: Let me finish my point. We're talking about Republican states where Democrats now look like they're going to pick up new seats like in Nevada, like in Tennessee and Arizona. So the judicial -- now I'm opposed to Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation, morally, principally, and for the sake of our court, but for these states Judge Kavanaugh is not the deciding factor. Donald Trump and his failing standings in the poll and has failed policies, that is what's giving -- that that's what's giving these Democrats a boost because the country wants a check and balance and these states show they want to check and balance on the Trump administration. BENSON: In these red states, if these Democratic Senators come out and refuse to confirm a qualified judge after the FBI investigation is over, it is going to be a serious problem. I've seen internal polls for Joe Manchin who's polling fairly comfortably ahead. If he votes no on Kavanaugh, it becomes a competitive race. He's aware of these dynamics. I think barring a surprise in the next few days, you'll get a couple Democrats voting for Kavanaugh. ZIMMERMAN: Well, I think quite to the contrary. MACCALLUM: You've got some huge decisions to make in the coming days. ZIMMERMAN: Federal Republican senators -- ' MACCALLUM: It's going to be fascinating to watch how they come down. ZIMMERMAN: Federal Republicans senators -- MACCALLUM: I mean, it could be that you get Republicans who vote no and you get enough Democrats who vote yes and it could swing votes. ZIMMERMAN: Well, I think Martha, if Republicans vote no, it just dies, the nomination ends. MACCALLUM: We'll see. ZIMMERMAN: OK. MACCALLUM: Thanks, guys. A trade war underway and now a Chinese warship that is coming dangerously close to one of ours in the South China Sea as cat-and-mouse escalates into what General Jack Keane calls a collision course with China. He's here next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We're looking at China and other countries and we're straightening out some of these horrible deals that stole our wealth, stole our jobs, stole so much from us. Actually in many ways stole our dignity. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Fresh off of what was widely seen as a win renegotiating the NAFTA deal, the president appears to be making China the next target accusing the communist superpower of meddling in our elections, manipulating our currency, and stealing intellectual property. Well, today, that tension escalated once again when a Chinese warship came within 50 yards -- look at this -- of a U.S. warship in the disputed waters of the South China Sea. General Jack Keane, Fox News Senior Strategic Analysts and Chairman of the Institute for the Study of war. General, welcome. Good to have you with us. What goes through your mind when you look at that image of those two ships? GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Well, I think it's symptomatic of a real challenge that the United States is facing. I mean, pun intended we're on a collision course with China. Certainly this incident there, given the nearness of it, the danger of it, something like that could escalate where our captain felt necessary to fire a warning shot, they'd fire back, next thing you know, we're using bigger weapons because one of our ships has been hit. So that's the concern that we have about something like that. But the larger issue, it was identified in the Trump team's national security strategy and national defense strategy when I think they set the current strategic framework very accurately and described that has a return to big power competition with China and Russia and specifically identified China as the long-term strategic threat to the United States national interest and to the security of the American people. And the reality is, China is conducting something they described as unrestricted warfare. And it's a doctrine that they have imposed on themselves and it gives them, in their minds, is their means to use anything that's available to them to gain influence over adversary countries. All the means available short of war. So economic warfare that should have-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: They could say the same thing about President Trump, that he views it the same way, that you can use the economic levers and the military levers all of the same time? KEANE: Yes, but what we're not doing what China is doing. They are conducting massive cyber information campaigns to all the countries in the region. And to a certain extent, the United States but much more significant in the region. Where they are undermining the government, disrupting civil societies, they are actually buying up newspapers so they can gain influence. One of the countries they are doing this rather significantly is far away as Australia. It's not exactly a country that is tangential to China but it's in the region and they want influence. The most rapid military buildup in the world today is being done not by the United States and the Trump defense budget, which we all applaud, but by China. Rebuilding their ground forces, the maritime forces are at parity with us now in the Pacific and they are going to l go right past us in capability. Deep water ports in Pakistan and also in Djibouti, why, influence the Middle East from Djibouti, influence the Indian Ocean from Pakistan. They have put in writing they want to dominate the Asia-Pacific in a near term, and in 20 years be the preeminent global power replacing the United States. That is the direction of China and that's why I say we are on a collision course with them. MACCALLUM: Important and scary. I just have about 10 seconds. But Pompeo is going to go back and meet with Kim Jong-un. Quick thought on that. KEANE: Good. Public diplomacy, the president says, he's in love. Never heard anything like that in my life by the president of the United States. But obviously the public diplomacy is positive. But listen, Martha, they have not turned over one single ballistic missile or one single nuclear weapon or even provided us the inventory of all of the above and the additional sites that are there supporting those activities. That is what Pompeo wants. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: General, thank you, as always. Great to see you. Thanks for being with us tonight. Coming up next, Hillary Clinton going back to going after the deplorables again. So, well, what didn't work last time worked now for Democrats? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: He has a view of America that is incredibly constrictive and he talks to that America, he talks to them all the time. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: To that America, he talks to them. Tucker Carlson joins us, he is there in New York City, on that, and also the lessons for today in \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: He has a view of America that is incredibly constrictive. And he talks to that America. He talks to them all the time. And it by no means the majority, as we know, but it is a very hard-core, who are responding to him and supporting him for a variety of reasons. Whatever they might be. Economic reasons, Supreme Court reasons, or some of these other more troubling biases and prejudices. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: They're just awful. They are in a basket of deplorables. Hillary Clinton back at it again, repeating some of her favorite themes from 2016. Joining me now, Tucker Carlson, host of Tucker Carlson Tonight, what a good name of the show, and the author of the book \"Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution.\" I looked up at \"Ship of Fools\" today, it's originally Plato-- TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS: Yes. MACCALLUM: -- but it's also a movie. (CROSSTALK) CARLSON: And a Grateful Dead song. MACCALLUM: So which one inspired you to name it -- and a Grateful Dead song. yes, exactly right. CARLSON: Yes. So the first in the third, Plato and Jerry Garcia together seemed a good combo. I wrote it because of moments like that. She's not attacking the president so much as she is attacking his voters. And the explanation is Trump won because it's a bad country, they're bigots because they supported Trump. Now that's fantasy, like the Russia explanation, but more than that, and more upsetting is that nobody, -- by the way, this includes some of the Republican leadership, has thought to why this happened. And of course it happened because the people in charge on Election Day in 2016 made a bunch of bad decisions and voters are mad about it. They have not learned from this experience at all and so the country becomes more divided as the elites refused to respond to voters, it becomes more volatile, and it becomes more prime for the next thing which could be even scarier in my opinion. MACCALLUM: Is there any hope in your book that this can -- you know, this is why she can find some way to end? CARLSON: Look, I'm not a social scientist or a philosopher. I am a talk show host. My job is to diagnose what's happening. But I believe in democracy. Very few people where I live in Washington still believe in it. And I think that if you respond to voters, you don't have to precisely follow the orders of the majority but if people are telling you over decades, for example, we think should have control of our borders, or don't sign trade deals where we are obviously getting ripped off, you need to listen to them and if you don't, they'll punish you. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Well, it's interesting because like Trevor Noah was positive about the president's trade deal, the New York Times wrote good things about the president's trade deal, so, you know, there are moments where people sort of-- (CROSSTALK) CARLSON: There are! MACCALLUM: They don't like him but I like-- (CROSSTALK) CARLSON: For the last two years should have -- yes, exactly right. MACCALLUM: Yes. CARLSON: I mean, to make everything about Trump the man, that's hardly the point. The point is that the country, the middle class, which is the core of the country, was shrinking and dying and nobody cared. And that's what this was about. You have to address that. MACCALLUM: So I want to ask you a little bit about the Brett Kavanaugh situation, which I think a lot of people have been so deeply disturbed by when they watch this process. CARLSON: Yes. MACCALLUM: You know, to a great extent on all sides. And I thought and I was reminded of \"To kill a Mockingbird.\" Because I think that the history of people being falsely accused-- (CROSSTALK) CARLSON: Exactly. MACCALLUM: -- and how wrong that is in this country -- and I'm not making a judgment about this case -- but that is a deep history, that's -- so there is a reason all kids read \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" And Rich Lowry spoke about it in an editorial and he said, \"The story in contemporary terms goes off the rails. Atticus Finch didn't hash tag, believe all women. He didn't take an accusation at face value. He defended an alleged rapist vigorously and unremittingly, making use of every other opportunity provided to him by the norms of the Anglo-America system of justice. He did it despite considerable social pressure to simply believe the accuser.\" CARLSON: Exactly. MACCALLUM: Who we all know is, you know, Mayella Ewell, a young woman, poor white women, who claimed that he had abused her. CARLSON: I've asked this question repeatedly on my show to people I've talking to about this, is there a time that you can think of an American history when people accused of sexual abuse, assault, rape, might have benefited, and justice benefited from a presumption of innocence and due process in all the norms of the justice system that we inherited really from Rome. Can you think of any? Did any come to mind? Like, what the NAACP founded in response to this? I think it was. How quickly we forget. Look, this moment will all be gone. People running things will be gone. Our grandchildren will still be here, one hopes, living in a country where people are not punished until they have been proved to have committed a crime. Like that's the whole reason it's worth living here. Let's not -- let's not throw that away. MACCALLUM: Yes. And jumping to a conclusion before you have that, and you know, some would say that's why they thought the FBI investigation was necessary, and I know you may feel differently about that, but that is what we're all -- I think of the Duke Lacrosse team-- CARLSON: Yes. MACCALLUM: -- which I know you covered in depth, you know, you have to take a breath. You have to look at these situations before you pass judgment. MACCALLUM: Well, sure. I mean, the idea that some people are more believable than others because of their DNA is grotesque. It's a perversion of justice, justice needs to be blind. We assess the facts. MACCALLUM: Absolutely. Whether it's a man or a woman. CARLSON: Of course. MACCALLUM: You need to look at the situation clearly. Tucker, thank you very much. CARLSON: Martha, thank you. MACCALLUM: The book is called \"Ship of Fools.\" Great to have you in New York-- (CROSSTALK) CARLSON: Thank you. MACCALLUM: It feels like fish out of water, but we love having you. CARLSON: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So coming up in the wake of Kavanaugh confirmation chaos, many are asking if due processes is under attack. We were just talking about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, if we throw evidence and law out the door, I mean, what kind of side are we left with? A scary world to live in, in my opinion. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Pete Hegseth talked to students on a Midwest college campus, and he joins us with what they are saying about this when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So the Brett Kavanaugh allegations are sparking a national debate over evidence and corroboration and due process as we have been talking about tonight. Here is President Trump earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: It's a very scary time for young men in America, when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of. This is a very, very -- this is a very difficult time. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So we sent Fox & Friends co-host Pete Hegseth to the College of the Ozarks to talk to college students about the future of all of this. Pete, good evening to you. And it's always interesting to be in a college campus and hear what they are talking about. PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS: Yes, very interesting time to be talking to college students in light of a national debate that we are having. We are at the College of the Ozarks, great kids behind us, also known as hard work U, this is a college where every kid weaves debt free because they work while they are on campus. Also probably the most patriotic campus I've seen other than our service academies. They love our veterans and our military. But I had a chance to talk to some of the students and ask them as a college student right now, in light of what you are seeing with the Brett Kavanaugh conversation, how do you feel about these allegations and the conversation being had? Martha, they had some pretty blunt answers for us. Here's some of the students had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The most important lesson I've taken away from all of us is that the things that I say and do today can affect my life in decades and even my career. In some ways, you can't -- you can't control what cameras are being pointed at you when. That's why you have to make sure that you are always a true person not just when you think somebody else is looking. LAUREN PRESLEY, STUDENT, COLLEGE OF OZARKS: He's innocent until proven guilty. I feel like people are mad at him because he is making -- you know, protecting himself, and trying to defend himself, and I feel like the left is really, you know, fighting on that. I just think it's a very difficult time to be a man and I think it's a difficult time to be a woman as well. As a female who is interested in going to the political realm, I think it's scary, if you have that R behind your name, I don't know what, you know, accusations people are going to come up with. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can say anything about anybody and if it's taken as fact, well, I mean, we're all in trouble. I mean, if we throw evidence and law out the door, I mean, what kind of side are we left with? It's scary world to live in, in my opinion. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEGSETH: Kids committed to the idea that you should be innocent until proven guilty and the rule of law has to matter in this country, Martha. MACCALLUM: Yes, it's really interesting to hear what they are saying, I thought the first young man who said, you know, that the biggest lesson for him was that whatever he does now could reflect deep into his future, and we've talked a lot about social media and how different it is. You know, we are looking at hand scrawled notes from Brett Kavanaugh that are under scrutiny for him when he was 17 years old. HEGSETH: Yes. MACCALLUM: It looks like the kids there are very aware that these things follow you throughout life. HEGSETH: The yearbook of yesterday is the Instagram account of today. They are very aware of that fact. Conduct is going to matter. So we are excited to be here. And as you know, Martha, tomorrow morning we are going to be live all morning Fox & Friends, of course, this campus, College of the Ozarks, after the Colin Kaepernick ad from Nike, Just Do It, they said no more Nike gear for us. They said they took a stand, we stand for the anthem. So a special campus, a lot of patriotism here, and we're going to talk to them even more tomorrow morning on Fox & Friends. MACCALLUM: Interesting. It's tough to pry the Nike away from college kids. So it's interesting they are taking such a strong stand. Thank you, Pete. (CROSSTALK) HEGSETH: They've taken a lot of blowback, Martha, but we'll see. MACCALLUM: Yes. HEGSETH: Thank you. MACCALLUM: We'll be watching. Thanks a lot. Good to see you tonight. So coming up, '80s icon Molly Ringwald is speaking out about scenes from her hit movies like this one. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've got Caroline in the bedroom right now passed out cold, I could violate her 10 different ways if I wanted to. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So how did that sound now? Kat Timpf and Tom Shillue, coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: She was a star of some of the biggest cult movies of the 1980s, but today in the Me Too era, actress Molly Ringwald is kind of changing her perspective on some of the scenes in her classic hits like \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"16 Candles.\" She said to NPR, \"As everyone says, and I do believe is true that times were different and what was acceptable then is definitely not acceptable now, and nor should it have been then. I feel very differently about the things -- that John Hughes movies she was talking about -- now.\" Here with me now, Kat Timpf and Tom Shillue, both are Fox News contributors. And Kat had to brush up on some of her 80s movies today to keep up with it. But you know, when you look at these, any a sort of time capsule kind of movie you look back at it and they are going to be things that you wouldn't see in today's movies. But let's give everybody here and everybody at home a little bit of a memory refresher on some of the scenes that Molly Ringwald is referring to. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I could (muted) anytime I want. I've got Caroline in the bedroom right now passed out cold, I could violate her 10 different ways if I wanted to. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was an accident. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're (muted). UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sue me. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you a tease? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She's a tease? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sure why he does forget it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're a tease and you know that all girls are teases. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: All right. TOM SHILLUE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: \"Breakfast Club,\" that was my favorite one. Favorite of all the club. MACCALLUM: Really? That was your favorite? SHILLUE: Yes. I love it. Always wanted to. You know, I never got to go to detention because I was such a good kid but I wanted to after that. MACCALLUM: These are bad kids were in detention and that's what happened in there. SHILLUE: Yes. MACCALLUM: What do you think? SHILLUE: I don't understand Molly Ringwald. She said it's a different time, the times are different. Wasn't acceptable now was then but it shouldn't have been then -- well, it was then, so it should have been. Everything was fine. You go back, it's not just the 80s, you can't stop there. I mean, go to \"Star Trek\",\" you know, Kirk was sexually assaulting people from other planets. You go to \"Casablanca,\" you know what happened in \"Casablanca?\" You know, Captain Renault he was -- he was trading sex for exit visas. You remember that, right. MACCALLUM: That kind of thing happened. SHILLUE: It happened in Casablanca. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: That kind of thing happens, it happens all over the place. SHILLUE: But you can't enjoy anything if you go by today's standards, which is why maybe something is wrong with the way we are thinking these days. MACCALLUM: Kat, what do you think? KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that some of the things that these characters said and did may have been problematic. However, what would a movie be like if none of these characters ever said or did anything problematic? Would it just be like a bunch of people sitting in a circle and like talking about how bad micro aggressions are, and then two hours of that and the credits roll? I don't understand. People are not going to the-- MACCALLUM: Yes. TIMPF: These are fake characters doing fake bad things. I think that if you really spending your time worrying what a fake person did in a fake scene, then things are probably not too bad. MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean, this is my point -- I mean, think about \"Caddyshack,\" think about \"Animal House,\" movies are not -- they're supposed to reflect sort of a little bit of a version of real life. If they reflected real life and everyone was perfect and behave perfectly, going to the movies would be quite boring, wouldn't it? SHILLUE: And we didn't behave that way, that's why it's a movie. \"Revenge of the Nerds.\" OK. I was one of the nerds. We watched \"Revenge of the Nerds\" but then we didn't really get our revenge. Our revenge was just watching the movie and fantasizing about it. TIMPF: Yes. Nice people just talking about how nice they are and being nice with no conflict, great movie. MACCALLUM: And the point of that first one, you know, he is the jerk. TIMPF: Right. MACCALLUM: He is the jerky guy who is saying that really obnoxious thing about violating this girl. So that's the point, the lesson of \"16 Candles\" I haven't re-watched it in a while but as I remember is that he is the jerk. SHILLUE: Yes. MACCALLUM: That's the point. How can he be a jerk if he is not a jerk in the movie, Tom? SHILLUE: Well, there is one scene in the movie when I guess the good guy, the romantic guy that everybody loves, I forgot his name but he is the hero, he is the one that falls in love with Molly Ringwald, right, because she-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Isn't it Andrew McCarthy? SHILLUE: So we're mixing them up. That's \"Pretty in Pink.\" MACCALLUM: You're right. That one is my favorite. SHILLUE: Yes, yes. He, and I think he turns to be a nice guy. But he is the rich guy but they don't expect him to be the nice guy. But in \"16 Candles\" there is a saying that this problematic because the good looking guy ends up having his drunk girlfriend he gives them to the other dude and he says, here, have a good time, like, you know, with the girl. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Because he's a boorish, its boorish behavior-- SHILLUE: Yes. MACCALLUM: -- which is what the movie is depicting. TIMPF: Right, absolutely. No one is saying be like this guy. No one is saying that. MACCALLUM: All right. Let's take a quick look at something now completely different which is the Vladimir Putin calendar, you can get in your orders for Christmas if you sign up now. SHILLUE: Yes. MACCALLUM: I'm not -- what is he in here? Is this a hot tub? TIMPF: It's a plunge pool. SHILLUE: It's a hot tub for what? MACCALLUM: He says with great authority. Of course it's a plunge pool, everyone knows that. SHILLUE: Yes. MACCALLUM: I mean, here he is cuddling up with a jaguar. TIMPF: I don't know. MACCALLUM: I'm going to say, a leopard, a jaguar, I know I'm going to get e-mails about the difference. SHILLUE: Yes. MACCALLUM: And there he is with a fish. SHILLUE: Catch up with his bare hands. MACCALLUM: Wait a -- I mean, he has a lot of self-confidence. TIMPF: Absolutely. I feel like being a dictator of a country must give you some serious self-confidence and you start to think, hey, maybe I'm in control of all of these people and this whole entire country, in complete control, not because that's the way it is but because they really want me to be in control, because they really like me. Apparently, also because they really like me without a shirt on. A lot of no shirts in these photos. MACCALLUM: I know. He is quite play to themselves. So, you know, we have a democracy and a democratically elected president but here's what it would look like if we had a Donald Trump calendar, so everybody can see if they want to sign up. SHILLUE: Nice swing. Where is that, any shirtless on a horse? MACCALLUM: No, no, no. Thanks to you guys. Good to see you. Nice trip back to the '80s. That's December of the calendar because he has a red hat. That's our \"Story\" on this Tuesday night. We'll see you back here tomorrow night at seven. Tucker is up next.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton says she won't think about a run until after midterms. Hillary Clinton insists she doesn\u2019t want to run for the White House again -- yet over the weekend, virtually in the same breath, seemed to leave that door open just a crack, saying she'd still \u201clike to be president.\u201d The latest wavering on the possibility of a 2020 presidential bid -- something she ruled out last year -- poses fresh complications for the Democratic Party, which is brimming with potential candidates looking to take on President Trump the moment the midterms are over and more than a few figures worried Clinton's presence hinders their ability to move on from 2016. Clinton\u2019s latest comments came during an interview with Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher at an event in New York City Friday. Swisher asked the former secretary of state if she wanted to run for president, to which Clinton responded after a pause: \u201cNo. No.\u201d \u201cThat was a pause,\u201d Swisher said. \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to be president,\u201d Clinton responded. \u201cI think, hopefully, when we have a Democrat in the Oval Office in January of 2021, there\u2019s going to be so much work to be done.\u201d Her response got more interesting, as she then talked up her well-known credentials: \u201cSo the work would be work that I feel very well prepared for having been at the Senate for eight years, having been a diplomat in the State Department, and it\u2019s just going to be a lot of heavy lifting.\u201d Whether she was pitching herself as a supporting player to a post-Trump Democratic president, or pitching herself as that president, was unclear.\u00a0Asked whether she would be doing any of that \u201cheavy lifting,\u201d Clinton responded: \u201cOh I have no idea ... I\u2019m not even going to think about it until we get through this Nov. 6 election about what\u2019s going to happen after that, but I\u2019m going to [do] everything in my power to make sure we have a Democrat in the White House come January of 2021.\u201d Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill\u00a0pushed back on reports playing up the possibility of a 2020 Clinton run. \u201cThis is not remotely what she said. When asked if she\u2019d run she said 'No.\u00a0(twice in fact),\u201d Merrill tweeted. Merrill reiterated that point when reached by Fox News on Monday. \u201cShe did not say she wouldn\u2019t rule out running. That\u2019s flat out incorrect,\u201d Merrill said in an email. \u201cShe said that she wouldn\u2019t decide who to support until we get through the midterms.\u201d Swisher also said on Twitter that she took Clinton's response to mean \"she was basically implying she wishes she were president but doesn\u2019t relish running again.\" Her message to the political class: \"Simmer down!\" Clinton did say \u201cno\u201d when asked whether she wants to run, backing up her comments last year that she is \u201cdone with being a candidate.\u201d But it did not appear that Clinton was referring to which Democratic candidate she might support either. 'I believe everything she\u2019s said and done all indicate one thing. She wants to run for office and she wants to run for the highest office in the land.' Some of those who know Hillary Clinton say a third presidential run is not out of the question. \u201cHillary Clinton has been all over the lot lately. She said first, we can\u2019t be civil with a political party trying to destroy us. After the 14 [mail] bombs were sent, she said we had to pull together as a nation and indeed be more than civil, which of course I agree and support,\u201d Fox News contributor Doug\u00a0Schoen, Democratic strategist and former adviser to former President Bill Clinton, told Fox News. \u201cBut I believe everything she\u2019s said and done all indicate one thing. She wants to run for office and she wants to run for the highest office in the land.\u201d Clinton ran unsuccessfully against President Trump and against former President Barack Obama in 2008. But the former secretary of state, New York senator\u00a0and first lady has maintained a never-fading public profile ever since the last election. Clinton went on a book tour last year promoting her memoir, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d and, earlier this month, announced that she and Bill Clinton would embark on a speaking tour later this year. Schoen said she \u201chopes to use\u201d the speaking tour as \u201ca launching pad, and hopes to make more money to boot.\u201d \u201cSecretary Clinton has changed her position on this and enough things that if she sees an opening in a multi-candidate field, she will run with alacrity, enthusiasm and impunity,\u201d Schoen said. Therein lies the challenge. Should Clinton jump in, she would face a much more crowded field than in 2016, when most potential Democratic candidates stayed on the sidelines. Senior Democrats as well as up-and-coming stars are showing no such hesitation this time. Senators like Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and others, are all either laying the groundwork for a run or keeping the door open. If Clinton were to run, it would touch off an even more intense battle for the heart and soul of the party. Another longtime Clinton aide, Philippe Reines, recently would not rule out another presidential run for Clinton, though he came close. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere between highly unlikely and zero,\u201d Reines told Politico earlier this month. \u201cBut it\u2019s not zero.\u201d Speaking with Fox News' \"The Story,\" he predicted she could win: \u201cEveryone loves a comeback.\u201d But he also compared the likelihood of her running again to someone\u2019s chances of winning the lottery. \u201cI\u2019m not saying she\u2019s going to run,\u201d Reines said. \u201cI think the odds are probably in the Powerball range.\u201d A spokesman for Biden told Fox News they had \u201cno comment\u201d on a possible Clinton run.",

            "article_content": " Can Republicans win the 2018 election? The mainstream press, the establishment, and history all say no. Poll numbers don\u2019t look good. The generic ballot is not where it needs to be. There\u2019s an enthusiasm gap. Liberals are excited. Conservatives aren\u2019t. Washington conventional wisdom has already decided the game is over. Republicans should just forfeit and go home. The truth is, over the next 25 days if our party doesn\u2019t show the sharp contrast in each party\u2019s vision for America, then the \u201cexperts\u201d will be right. However, if Republicans, in a clear and direct way, show the difference, we can win. The Democratic Party of 2018 has adopted the most extreme positions in American history. Don\u2019t believe us? Consider this: While trying to destroy Judge Kavanaugh, Democrats applaud Colin Kaepernick when he disrespects our flag. They embrace New York\u2019s Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo when he says \u201c[America] was never that great.\u201d And Democrats cheer Rep. Maxine Waters, D- Calif., when she encourages the harassment of the president\u2019s supporters and says \u201cimpeachment\u201d 8 times in one sentence. Their message: Raise taxes, abolish ICE, socialize medicine, and impeach the president. Again, don\u2019t believe us? Consider this: Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wants to roll back the GOP tax cuts. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., says, \u201cIt\u2019s time to abolish ICE and start over.\u201d Seventeen Democratic senators now support Bernie Sanders\u2019 socialized health care bill. And, when Senator Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was asked, \u201cWhen y\u2019all going to impeach Trump?\u201d he replied, \u201cSooner the better.\u201d These radical positions aren\u2019t shared by the country. Most Americans respect the flag and those who fought to protect the freedoms it represents. Most Americans understand the United States is the greatest nation in history, and they want to keep America great. And most Americans appreciate what has happened in 20 months under President Trump\u2019s leadership: In short, families have more money, constitutionalists are on the court, and the president is keeping his word on foreign policy. Certainly, there is more work to do. ObamaCare continues to drive up health care costs. -- It has to be replaced. Able-bodied adults continue to receive your tax dollars without a requirement to work. Welfare reform has to happen. Drugs and gang members continue to cross our border, causing harm to so many American communities. The border security wall has to be built. And finally, just because your name is Clinton, Comey, Lynch, McCabe, or Strzok doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re above the law. The double standard for the Washington-connected class has to end. But it won\u2019t if Democrats win. \u00a0Other common sense policies will not happen either if Republicans lose the majority. Former Republican Congressman Dick Armey once said, \u201cWhen we act like us, we win. When we act like them, we lose.\u201d It\u2019s time for Republicans to act like us. It\u2019s time for Republicans to be bold, not timid. It\u2019s time for Republicans to show the American people how radical the left has become. It\u2019s time for Republicans to campaign with confidence and win. Republican Mark Meadows is in his third term representing North Carolina\u2019s 11th District in the U.S. House of Representatives. He serves as Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and on the House Oversight Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee, and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.",

            "article_content": "Teachers come here to educate American students in a number of subjects on a J-1 cultural exchange visa LAS VEGAS \u2013 Adrian Calabano, 23, left his native Philippines to fill a void of teachers in a Nevada suburb. He said he sold his car to pay for his flight and hefty administrative fees so he could get a salary several times higher than he would receive in his homeland. But his salary is still lower than an average American teacher. He was hired to teach sixth grade special education class at Greenspun Junior High School in Henderson, Nev., a suburb of Las Vegas. \u201cMy salary is much better than what I receive and get from the Philippines,\u201d he told Fox News. As debate over low teacher salaries makes its way across the country \u2013 there have been statewide protests in at least four states the past two months \u2013 this little-known U.S. program for foreign teachers is growing. U.S. school districts are increasingly hiring teachers from abroad to fill a dearth of teacher in school districts across the country. They are brought in through a cultural exchange visa program offered by the U.S. State Department. Known as the J-1 visa, it is the ticket for teachers abroad to come to the U.S. and teach American students. Adrian Calabano, 23, readies his classroom. Filipino and here on a J-1 visa, he teaches sixth grade special education at a junior high school outside Las Vegas. (Fox News) But the program has come under heavy criticism by educators who feel it is depressing already low teacher wages and displacing America educators who would earn higher wages. Because the foreign teacher is working on a visa considered a \u201ccultural exchange,\u201d the district does not have to offer them the perks and benefits a regular teacher would get. States increasingly using the program to hire teachers include Arizona, California, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, and Nevada. There were 2,867 J-1 visa holders placed in U.S. schools in 2017, up from about 1,197 in 2010, according to the U.S. State Department. The J-1 visa is temporary, lasting about two to three years. Critics say the foreign teachers don\u2019t hold the same credentials as local educators and are a legal loophole for districts to pay even lower teacher salaries. Plus, critics say, it\u2019s not solving the overall issue \u2013 teacher shortages. \"It's just putting a Band-aid on a huge gaping wound,\u201d said Michelle Kim, a spokesperson for the Clark County Education Association, the local teacher's union. \u201cWhat kind of message is the district sending? They can solve the issue if they were to prioritize and compensate educators that they have.\u201d Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, the largest union for educators in the country, said the visas are not in the best interest of teachers.\u00a0She calls the program an \u201cabuse of an exchange program.\u201d \u201cEvery classroom in America needs a well-supported, well-trained, well-paid educator helping students learn and thrive,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cTeachers fight every day for the resources to do their job, and we fight for and with them \u2014 that includes solving shortages by improving wages and working conditions and giving teachers the professional respect, voice and latitude they need to succeed.\u201d Calabano acknowledges that he and his other fellow Filipino colleagues have come under criticism. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some complaints from my other Filipino teachers, I mean, from my friends, that some American teachers, they think we\u2019re incompetent, especially in speaking English,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some parents, I\u2019ve heard some of my friends, they told me that some parents are hard to deal with. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because of their kids or if it relates to our country.\u201d Supporters say the foreign teachers are filling a critical need \u2013 and it benefits everyone who takes part in the program. \u201cIt\u2019s a mutually beneficial program that brings experienced foreign teachers with specialized training and education into American classrooms,\u201d said James Bell, president of Alliance Abroad, which sponsors many foreign teachers. \u201cU.S. children receive bilingual teaching experiences, learn about other cultures and countries, and benefit from the teachers\u2019 expertise in areas such as special education, STEM education and foreign language.\u201d This is all taking place among a fraught political background as U.S. teachers are solidifying their political might. This year, thousands of educators have organized walkouts of their classrooms, temporarily paralyzed school districts and amassed in multitudes at their state capitols to demand higher wages, more school resources and to renegotiate their pensions and benefits. States like Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona, and West Virginia have, for the most part, conceded to teachers\u2019 pleas, avoiding protracted battles between legislators and unions by agreeing to give educators raises and investing more tax dollars in schools. And, amid all this democratic noise, every state in the country for the 2017-2018 school year was experiencing a teacher shortage, according to the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank that compiles such data. Data compiled by education think tank Learning Policy Institute show why U.S. teachers leave the profession. (Fox News) In Clark County, Nev., Calabano and about 80 Filipinos were hired by the Clark County School District to teach special education. As the fifth largest district in the nation, it employs approximately 18,000 teachers. For Calabano and those teachers wanting to come here, the visa application process is lengthy, costly, and has a number of requirements. Would-be visa holders need to have a sufficient level of proficiency in English and are required to have been a teacher and must have been teaching in their country of origin for at least two years. Many nonprofits work in tandem and sponsor applicants for a fee to help them get recruited to teach in U.S. schools. The J-1 visa goes beyond teachers, also including au pairs, camp counselors and foreign exchange students, professors or researchers. For some school districts, it is a critical lifeline for districts dealing with severe teacher shortages. \u201cThe district uses the J-1 Visa program as part of its recruiting program. Due to the extreme shortage of teachers in Arizona and the United States, we work on every aspect of recruiting to obtain teachers but it is virtually impossible to fill the number of teachers needed with candidates who are U.S. citizens. This is a temporary, legal way for the district to hire teachers and provides a cultural diversity our schools need and want,\u201d said Nedda Shafir, a spokesperson for the Pendergast Elementary School District in Phoenix. Shafir disputes the notion that her district is prioritizing international teachers over U.S. citizens. Since 2015, around 50 foreign teachers have been hired out 500. Shafir said the hires take place not instead of, but in addition to, American hires. Once the visa expires, the foreign teacher musts return home. They cannot request to return to the U.S. for two years. Calabano said he has learned a lot and wishes he could extend the visa. \u201cFor me I want to stay, but I\u2019m required to go back to the Philippines, for a certain time,\u201d he said. \u201cLong term, if I can get a working visa, I would love that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "FILE: Oct 16, 2012: Mitt Romney and President Obama walks past each other at the end of their last debate at Lynn University, in Boca Raton, Fla. (AP) Both the Obama and Romney campaigns are going to be focused on a select group of voters in the final two weeks until election day. They are operating under the assumption that minds can be changed in the last weeks and, indeed, they can. But the real question is which minds and where are they? First, 40 of the 50 states have already been decided for quite some time. With respect to non-swing states, the electoral map has barely shifted throughout the campaign. This leaves us with 10 swing states that are going to decide the election. Within these states there are just five to seven percent of the electorate that remain undecided at this point. This means that in a country of roughly 300 million people there are maybe one to 1.5 million voters that can still be influenced in these final two weeks. The tactics employed by both candidates in Monday night\u2019s foreign policy debate were clearly geared towards these remaining undecided voters. [pullquote] Governor Romney was saying to people who thought that he was too extreme \u2013 and too inexperienced \u2013 that he is closer to the moderate governor of Massachusetts he once was than the extreme candidate that we saw in the Republican primaries. His support for Obama\u2019s agenda in Iran, Syria and Afghanistan highlighted that he is not interested in fighting, but in peaceful solutions and protecting American interests. The Mitt Romney we saw Monday night was not reckless, but cautious and knowledgeable. Most of all, he was competent and presidential. President Obama\u2019s goal in the debate was to appeal to working class democrats and independents. He emphasized his role in bailing out the auto industry, his plan for creating jobs and balancing the budget by raising taxes on the highest earners, not the middle class. He came across as centrist rather than liberal \u2013 more former President Clinton than the Obama we have seen throughout the campaign. The rest of the campaign will be fought between the two men we saw on Monday night. The moderate and conciliatory Governor Romney and the centrist President Obama. And it will be fought in just a few key states \u2013 even less than the ten total that are still up for grabs according to the Real Clear Politics electoral map. The Obama campaign has all but conceded that they will not win Florida and North Carolina where it is looking increasingly likely that Romney will come out on top. And although Virginia is currently tied, the expectation is that it will go to Romney. They also expect that they will win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. This means that the election is effectively about Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, Colorado and Nevada. As I argue above, only five to seven percent of the electorate in each of these states can still be persuaded and we are therefore talking about less than a million voters who have yet to make up their minds and will, when they do, decide this election. If we look even more closely at the electoral map and the number of votes each state carries, of those that are still in play, and once we have excluded those that are technically toss ups but have been more or less decided, it really all comes down to Ohio. With 18 electoral votes, it is one of the most valuable on the map. And it has become increasingly insecure for an Obama campaign that has gone from a five to seven point lead in early October to only a one or two point edge. In fact, Tuesday\u2019s Suffolk poll had the race tied in Ohio. All in all, there are less than a million Americans out there that are going to be the target of the final campaign push. Romney will be courting the working class swing voters in Ohio and Obama will be fighting to keep them. These are the people who are the most persuadable at this point and with such a small number of voters driving the outcome of the election, it is all the more clear how deadlocked this race really is.",

            "article_content": "President Trump celebrates surging economic numbers on the heels of his trade agreement with Europe; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Stars. Republicans gearing up for the upcoming midterms were handed a powerful weapon on Friday as they start to head home to begin the campaign for re-elections -- a booming economy. The Commerce Department announced Friday that the economy grew by 4.1 percent in the second quarter of 2018, making it the fastest economic expansion in almost four years. GDP REPORT SHOWS BOOMING 4.1 PERCENT GROWTH, AS TRUMP TOUTS 'AMAZING' NUMBERS The White House hailed the numbers as an indication that tax cuts, deregulation and tough trade practices have paid off. \u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions,\u201d President Trump declared. \u201cOnce again, we are the economic envy of the entire world.\u201d The numbers come at a crucial time for Republicans. Lawmakers in the House, which is seen as most likely to flip in November, broke for recess this week, and are heading home to an electoral outlook that suggests a \u201cblue wave\u201d could be in the offing for Democrats. Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, part of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, is now predicting that the race for the House tilts toward the Democrats and that they are now \u201ca little better than 50-50 to win the House\u201d -- the first time it has made such a prediction. It also made 17 House ratings changes -- all in favor of the Democrats. Additionally, a Quinnipiac University Poll found that Democrats have opened a 12-point lead on the generic House ballot -- a gap that Republicans had almost closed just a few months ago. In Washington, President Trump has been dogged by revelations about former attorney Michael Cohen\u2019s payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Trump, as well as a troubled European trip in which he was widely criticized for appearing to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s claims that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 election. Trump later walked back some of his comments The economic numbers give Republicans a chance to refocus attention away from the Russia investigation and back onto claims that they are delivering on bread-and-butter issues. They will be hoping that the old addage from former Clinton strategist James Carville -- \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d -- will still be true in 2018. Republicans quickly took advantage of the numbers on Friday, hailing them as proof that Republican policies on tax and regulations are working. \u201cThis is yet another indication that our economy is surging, and Americans are better off now,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s, R-Wis., office said in a press release, a nod to the House GOP slogan: \u201cBetter Off Now.\u201d \u201cThe voters will have a choice this November, do you want more jobs and higher wages or would you rather have more government and higher taxes, which is what the Democrats are selling?\u201d Rep. Keith Rothfus, R-Pa., said on \u201cFox News @ Night.\u201d It also complicates matters for Democrats, who under the banner of \u201cFor the People\u201d, are looking to pivot to a message focused more on economics rather than a strictly anti-Trump platform. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, took a stab at a more populist economic pushback on the economy numbers Friday, arguing in a thread on Twitter that it only benefited the rich and big corporations. \u201cThe GOP promised their tax bill would be \u201crocket fuel\u201d for the economy. Instead, it blew up the deficit by a trillion dollars & sparked a surge in stock buybacks, benefiting the biggest corps, their execs & wealthy shareholders while leaving middle-class families largely behind,\u201d he tweeted, before asking: \u201cSo. Where\u2019s your raise?\u201d But such a platform is fraught with dangers. With a booming economy resulting just months after the Trump tax cuts, a platform of rolling back those tax cuts could be dangerous for Democrats. Republicans were delighted in May when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., suggested Democrats would roll back the Trump tax cuts if they took control of the House. PELOSI SAYS DEMS WILL WORK TO ROLL BACK TRUMP TAX CUTS IF THEY RETAKE CONGRESS \"I do think we should revisit the tax legislation in a way that we always have, in a bipartisan, transparent way that the result is unifying for the country,\u201d she said. National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Matt Gorman jumped on Pelosi's comment, tweeting: \"I promise you that will be in almost every GOP ad this fall.\" Fox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor's note: This essay is excerpted from the author's new book \"Positive Populism.\" If you take inflation into account, in 1972 the average American worker earned $738.86 a week. In 2016, the figure was $723.67 a week. Forty-four years and a pay cut of 2 percent. That shocking fact alone explains why we need a revolution. The institutions and policies that shape today\u2019s economy, society and government overwhelmingly benefit those at the top\u2014not just the famous \u201c1 percent\u201d but more like the top 20 percent. Working Americans have been left out of the many great advances made by this elite in the last few decades, and the ladder into the elite is mostly broken. This state of affairs\u2014intimately linked to the transformative trends of our time, globalization and technology\u2014is not inevitable or something outside our control, like the weather, but is instead the result of deliberate policy choices made by the elite who benefit from them. Those policy choices are an ideology in their own right, shared by a ruling class of Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, and we can describe that ideology as elitism. Elitism\u2019s defining characteristic, and the central reason for its failure, is the concentration of economic and political power in the hands of the few, not the many. That\u2019s why we need a specifically populist revolution. The result of the 2016 presidential election and Great Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote to leave the European Union five months before were the first tangible signs that such a revolution may be possible. In both cases, members of the ruling class\u2014in all mainstream political parties, in business, in academia, in the bureaucracy, and in the media were united on one side; yet voters chose the other. The shell-shocked elites really should have seen it coming. Over the past few decades, anonymous technocrats, bureaucrats, and corporate apparatchiks built a governing axis between Big Government and Big Business. In turn, politicians\u2014buoyed by donors, charmed by lobbyists, and courted by the media in exclusive watering holes like Davos, Brussels, and Washington\u2014forged a bipartisan consensus backing globalization, automation, centralization, and uncontrolled immigration. Power shifted from people to unelected overlords and moved from nation-states to international bodies like the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and the EU. In the economy, the rich got richer and working people saw their incomes go down and their jobs go away. Meanwhile, in our society, the human ties of family and community that bring us together were ripped apart, with nothing but arid techno-commercialism to take their place. Yet for decades, the elites have promised working people everything: higher wages, bigger homes, better education for their children, affordable health care, and a strong national defense. You\u2019ll do better than your parents, they\u2019ve promised, and your children will do better than you. And the elite have fulfilled those promises\u2014for themselves. They\u2019ve built their children glorious schools, created the best health care system in the world for their parents, and watched their wages and wealth climb without limit. But did they notice that in recent decades, for most people\u2014around 80 percent of people\u2014those promises were not delivered? Did they stop to listen, to observe, to take in the criticism? To perhaps slow down the growth of their bureaucracies, or halt the creeping centralization of power into their hands? No. They held on, no matter what. So there are good reasons for the rage at today\u2019s establishment: insecurity in the present, anxiety about the future, and impatience for change. It adds up to a whole lot of anger. But anger without an agenda leads to self-pity and further frustration. In the meantime, populism has been defined by the people who don\u2019t believe in it. It has been characterized by elites on the left as \u201cnativist,\u201d even \u201cracist\u201d; by elites on the right as \u201cunconservative\u201d or \u201canti-capitalist.\u201d That\u2019s why the populist revolution needs to be fashioned into a coherent and positive political philosophy, one that understands and respects today\u2019s anti-elite sentiment but channels it away from any dark ends toward constructive and lasting transformation of our economy, society and government. We can agree that globalism isn\u2019t democratic\u2014without becoming isolationists. We can agree that a nation is not a nation unless it can enforce its borders\u2014without being racist. We can agree that cultural norms such as two-parent families and a work ethic play a role in lifting people out of poverty\u2014without being bigoted. There is a long, proud tradition of populism in America. Not all of it is good, of course. But populism gave rise to this country, and has sustained it ever since. Each generation of Americans has fulfilled the legacy of the Founding Fathers with its own American revolution. Populists peopled the West, extinguished slavery, and fought for women\u2019s suffrage. They won two world wars, established civil rights, and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. But we\u2019ve lost that momentum. We\u2019ve let the centralizers and the bureaucrats get the better of us. The elitists think they know how to run your life, but they don\u2019t: you do. Whether through more parental control of education, more competition in key sectors of the economy, or more decision making at the local level, positive populists are united by a single principle: putting power in people\u2019s hands, in your hands. Here\u2019s what positive populism means in practical terms. It is a pro-worker economic agenda designed to lift the living standards and reduce the economic anxiety of the majority of working families whose incomes fell as economic power was concentrated in the hands of the elite. It is a social policy agenda that aims to repair our torn social fabric, focusing in particular on the breakdown of family and community. It is an agenda for political reform that is all about decentralizing power and fighting corruption. Further, by appealing to universal values and ambitions, positive populism seeks to lift up the most disadvantaged citizens and those struggling to keep pace with the rapid changes all around. Power must be wrenched from the clenched fists of the insiders and the plutocrats and the assorted hangers-on of our comfortable ruling class. And I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I\u2019m one of them. I joined the British Conservative Party\u2019s HQ during Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government, started my own business, and then re-entered politics as senior advisor to Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street\u2013the heart of power. I later moved to California with my family, taught at Stanford and launched a tech start-up in Silicon Valley. So yes, I am a bona fide member of the elite class. But I\u2019ve never forgotten where I came from. I grew up in a small town in the south of England. My parents were Hungarian immigrants; they met while working in the kitchen of a cafe at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. My father (who had once been the goalkeeper for the Hungarian national hockey team, winning an Olympic medal), walked out on us and returned to Hungary when I was four. My mother earned what she could as a clerk in a shoe store and later in the \u201ctyping pool\u201d of a bank\u2019s head office. Later, she met my stepfather, also Hungarian, arriving in Britain as a refugee after the 1956 Soviet invasion. He found work on a construction site and over the years built his own small construction business. It\u2019s because of all these experience that I not only understand the failures of elitism, but also want to do everything in my power to overturn it and fight for the interests of working Americans. In 2016, I took my two sons to visit the National Constitution Center. Having studied politics, philosophy, and economics at Oxford, I vaguely recalled the differences between America\u2019s founding documents and the British system, which has no written Constitution. But standing there in Philadelphia, contemplating my family\u2019s new life in the United States, I was moved to tears by the Center\u2019s exhibits and dramatic reenactment of America\u2019s founding story. The American people took power back from a remote, bureaucratic empire. What a remarkable idea. America\u2019s is the first documentary Constitution in the modern world, and a model for all other nation-states. The best nation in the world, founded on the most beautiful idea in the world: liberty under the law. And it all begins with \u201cWe, the People.\u201d Reprinted from \"POSITIVE POPULISM:\u00a0Revolutionary Ideas to Rebuild Economic Security, Family, and Community in America.\" Copyright \u00a9 2018 by Steve Hilton.

Bob Menendez is projected to win re-election in New Jersey, defeating Republican businessman Bob Hugin, according to the Fox News Decision Desk. Although some Republicans had viewed Menendez as vulnerable due to a 2017 federal corruption trial, the two-term Senate veteran never trailed Hugin in pre-election polling. Menendez fended off his wealthy Republican challenger and a barrage of ads about his tossed-out corruption charges to win re-election. FULL MIDTERMS RESULTS Menendez, 64, secured a third six-year term Tuesday after a grueling campaign against Republican Bob Hugin. Polls showed Hugin, 64, and Menendez much closer than expected in overwhelmingly Democratic New Jersey. Hugin tapped his deep pockets for at least $27.5 million and spent on TV ads attacking Menendez over the 2017 trial on charges that he helped a friend with Medicare billing in exchange for lavish gifts. Bob Hugin, the Republican challenger for Bob Menendez's seat in the U.S. Senate, speaks during a debate with the Democratic candidate, Sen. Bob Menendez, in Newark, N.J. in October (AP) The charges were dropped this year after a mistrial. MIDTERMS LIVE BLOG The race was particularly significant because Democrats are defending 26 seats, including 10 incumbents running in states that President Trump won in 2016. Voters in the Garden State settled a closely watched Senate contest between the Democratic incumbent and the Republican Hugin, who previously served as CEO of the drug maker Celgene. They also voted for representatives in New Jersey's dozen House races. Menendez secured his third term among six other candidates who were also on the ballot. Voters also weighed in on a $500 million education bond issue. President Trump endorsed Hugin in blue New Jersey's Senate contest, leading Menendez to tweet out his gratitude. The president said Tuesday that Hugin would be a \"Great Senator.\" Hugin has kept his distance from Trump, who's unpopular in New Jersey. He even said during the campaign that he's not a \"Trump Republican.\" Menendez campaigned in part on Trump's unpopularity and said Hugin would be a \"rubber stamp\" for the president. In response to the president's tweet, Menendez tweeted, \"Thank you.\" The Associated Press contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Stivers says a vote for Republicans is a vote for prosperity while a vote for Democrats is a vote for despair. In the midterm elections Tuesday, every American will have an important choice to make at the ballot box. Do you want our strong economy to grow even stronger, our low unemployment rate to go even lower, your taxes to be cut even further, and America to be made even greater? If so, vote for Republicans and keep the GOP the majority party in the U.S. House and Senate. Or do you want to reverse all the progress made on these fronts by President Trump and the Republican Congress over the last two years? Do you want to bring back a poorly performing economy, higher unemployment, higher taxes and a weaker and more problem-plagued America? If so, vote for Democrats. We already know that Democrats want to not only repeal the Republican tax cuts, but have plans that would require raising your taxes. Look no further than the Democrats\u2019 prescription for health care: a single-payer government takeover that would cost a staggering $32.6 trillion over 10 years and end Medicare and Department of Veterans Affairs health care as we know it. Democrats would kick 179 million Americans off of their private health-care plans. A Republican-led Congress promises policies to keep our country on a path toward prosperity and continue to deliver results for the American people. A House of Representatives controlled by a Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would grind the progress of our nation to a halt and return the country to the economic stagnation and decline of the past. The October jobs report shows that our economy continues to boom, thanks to Republican economic policies including tax cuts and a commitment to reducing regulations. More than 250,000 jobs were created in October across the U.S., exceeding expectations. What\u2019s more, wages are growing at an annual rate of 3.1 percent \u2013 the fastest pace in nearly a decade. The national unemployment rate in September and October was just 3.7 percent \u2013 the lowest rate since 1969. The U.S. now has more open jobs than job seekers. Health care, manufacturing, construction, transportation and warehousing fueled October\u2019s strong job growth. The wage gains are coming at a time of record profits for U.S. companies after we\u2019ve lowered the corporate tax rate from being one of the highest in the world. With the Republican-passed tax cuts, Americans are getting to keep more of their hard-earned money. Because of Republicans, more people have a shot at the American Dream today than ever before. Our policies have lifted up everyone, including those who had been forgotten for far too long. We finally have America moving forward. Why would anyone want to turn back? If you want results over dysfunction, I encourage you to vote Republican on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Analyzing different scenarios that could leave the House in either Democrat or Republicans hands. Do you have more money than you know what to do with? Do you want to pay higher taxes to get rid of some of your excess cash? Do you want to pay more for the products you buy so businesses can afford to comply with more government regulations? Do you want to pay more to fill up your car, heat and cool your home, and power everything you own that runs on electricity? Do you think American companies are creating too many jobs and do you want to see the unemployment rate increase? If you can honestly answer \u201cyes\u201d to all these questions you should vote for Democrats in the midterm elections Tuesday. But if your answer is \u201cno\u201d you should elect Republicans to Congress who will support the cuts in taxes and cuts in unneeded government regulations that have been made by the Trump administration and the Republican Congress. Those cuts are responsible for our booming economy, the lowest unemployment rate since 1969, and a surge in domestic energy production that is holding down energy prices and creating jobs. Democratic candidates are relentlessly attacking the GOP tax cuts. The Democrats want to pick the pockets of every American family and business now paying lower taxes under that law. In addition to cutting family incomes, that would hurt business that are creating jobs. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0 recently said\u00a0that Republicans \u201cexploded the deficit\u201d when they passed \u201ctheir tax scam.\u201d Pelosi sharply criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who suggested that the only way to solve America\u2019s growing debt crisis is to reform entitlement programs \u2013 notably Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. McConnell said recently that America\u2019s \u201cdisturbing\u201d national debt is primarily the result of \u201ca bipartisan reluctance to tackle entitlement changes because of the popularity of those programs. Hopefully, at some point here, we\u2019ll get serious about this.\u201d Pelosi reacted angrily to McConnell\u2019s comments, saying: \u201cLike clockwork, Republicans in Congress are setting in motion their plan to destroy the Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that seniors and families rely on, just months after they exploded the deficit by $2 trillion with their tax scam for the rich.\u201d Democrats and many in the media who are blaming the GOP tax cuts for our budget deficits are wrong. They\u2019re just looking for an excuse to do what they love best \u2013 raising taxes. Although it\u2019s true that the federal budget deficit increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 \u2013 from $666 billion to $779 billion \u2013 tax revenues actually\u00a0increased. In the 2017 fiscal year, the federal government collected\u00a0$3.315 trillion,\u00a0compared to\u00a0$3.329 trillion\u00a0in the 2018 fiscal year. Even better, in September this year the country enjoyed a budget surplus of $119 billion for the month. By comparison, in September 2017 there was a surplus of just $8 billion. The reason revenues have slightly increased over the past year despite massive tax cuts is because the economy has been growing substantially, thanks in large part to the Trump administration\u2019s pro-energy policies, regulatory rollbacks and the Republican tax cuts. In the second quarter, U.S. gross domestic product increased by a whopping 4.2 percent annualized rate. To put that in perspective, President Obama never presided over a single year in which GDP growth topped 3 percent. In fact, 2 percent growth was heralded as the\u00a0new normal\u00a0by many politicians, pundits, and economists during the Obama presidency. If the economy is surging and tax revenues aren\u2019t falling, why are deficits continuing to rise? The answer is that government spending has significantly outpaced rising revenues. According to Treasury Department\u00a0data,\u00a0the United States spent $127 billion more in the 2018 fiscal year than it did in the 2017 fiscal year. The increased spending includes $65 billion more on national defense and $43 billion on Social Security payments. Perhaps most stunning, however, is that Americans paid $325 billion in the 2018 fiscal year on interest payments to those holding U.S. debt \u2013 $62 billion more than what was spent in the 2017 fiscal year. The biggest reason interest payments have grown so high in recent years is because the federal government ran huge deficits for the entirety of the Obama administration. The Obama administration spent more money than every other presidential administration in U.S. history \u2013 in large part because President Obama signed a massive economic stimulus package into law and refused to reform America\u2019s largest welfare programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Combined, Medicare and Medicaid spending cost the federal government about $1 trillion in the 2018 fiscal year. Social Security cost an additional $988 billion. And as our population continues to age, the gap between Social Security\u2019s costs and revenues is expected to become a major fiscal problem for the country. The only way to fix America\u2019s out-of-control debt crisis is to reform Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security \u2013 along with making other important spending cuts, just as McConnell noted. Failing to take these steps will continue to push deficits ever higher, raising debt payments and crowding out other important government programs in the future. Contrary to many Democrats\u2019 claims, raising taxes won\u2019t solve these important problems. Instead, we should demand the federal government play by the same rules as every household. If we and our families can\u2019t spend far more money than we take in, why should our government? A Republican House and Senate will work with President Trump to make needed entitlement spending reforms and make sensible spending cuts. But if Democrats win control of the House in Tuesday\u2019s elections, as many expect, look for them to obstruct needed entitlement reforms and instead push for tax increases and greater government regulation \u2013 the wrong solutions, guaranteed to weaken our economy and hurt American families.",

New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had a quick answer when asked how Americans would pay for the 'Medicare for all' plan she and other socialist-leaning Democrats favor: \"Just pay for it.\" In an interview with Jorge Ramos last week, Ocasio-Cortez was asked how she would pay for the multibillion-dollar health care plan promoted by liberal lawmakers like Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif. Ramos noted critics say the program would be \"more expensive\" than the current system, to which she answered that people would \"just pay for it.\" \u201cPeople often say, like, how are you going to pay for it and I find the question so puzzling because \u2018How do you pay for something that\u2019s more affordable? How do you pay for cheaper rent?\u2019 You just pay for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re paying more now.\u201d According to recent studies, the program, first introduced by Sanders over the summer, would increase government health spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years. The spending hikes would allow the government to replace what employers and consumers currently pay for health care \u2014 delivering significant savings on administrative and drug costs, but increasing demand for care that would drive up spending, according to a study released by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University over the summer. The study estimated that doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes would not fully cover the additional costs for the program. But under the plan, all Americans would gain access to government insurance with no copays or deductibles for medical services. The insurance industry would be relegated to a minor role in the system. Supporters argue that other developed countries already have implemented systems like this, and America\u2019s private insurance-centered model continues to leave some families with crushing costs. \u201cIn a modern, moral and wealthy society, no person should be too poor to live,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told Ramos. \u201cWe should treat healthcare, housing, and education as rights.\u201d She added: \u201cI believe we should guarantee a basic level of human dignity in America.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated long-time incumbent Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep.

            "article_content": "Texans have all eyes on the Senate race. Casey Stegall gets the pulse of the people at the state fair. The Texas State Fair in Dallas might seem like an unlikely place to talk politics \u2013 after all, most people are more apt to debate what to call their favorite fair food (out-of-staters beware: It's \"corny\" dog, not \"corn\" dog) than make a dust-up over their favorite politician. That said, Texans \u2013 red, blue, or otherwise \u2013 come from all across the state to attend the State Fair each year with something like a religious fervor. And they bring their Texas-size opinions with them. Fox News attended the fair to get a pulse check on what voters were thinking about as they headed into the midterms. One issue that was top of mind was health care. That's in line with the rest of the country. A Fox News poll earlier this month found health care topped the list of issues voters would consider when heading to the polls. It didn't take long before the topic came up with voters Fox News spoke with, either. One woman we stopped was Phyllis Davison, a retiree on Medicare. \"I still have to get a supplemental insurance to go with that in order to take care of myself,\" Davison told us. \"You've worked hard all your life, you know, and then you have a pension and you have the Social Security \u2013 and that still doesn't take care of you.\" Later, another woman on Medicare, Linda Snelling, agreed. \"I think our\u00a0health care is in a horrible state,\" she said. Healthcare has become a big issue in the big race everyone's talking about in Texas \u2013 the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and his Democratic challenger, Beto O'Rourke. Health care dominated part of last debate between the two. Cruz said O'Rourke is proposing socialized medicine and would bankrupt Medicare. \"It puts the federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor,\" said Cruz. O'Rourke countered that Cruz was playing the politics of fear, claiming Cruz \"...voted to take away health care from millions of American families and vows to repeal protections, pre-existing conditions.\" Voters were pretty evenly split on who they would support in that race. And everyone had an opinion on Obamacare. No one seemed to love it, and some downright hated it. Corey Foreman talked to us after waiting in a long line for food. He was about to take a bite when we approached him. He put down his food and looked thoughtfully. \"I think that Obama had some good ideas about health care,\" Foreman said. \"I think that he wanted to go in the right direction.\" Janice Caro thought there were a lot of problems with Obamacare. But she added: \u201cIf Democrats and Republicans would work together, hopefully they could solve those problems.\" Snelling does not think the government alone could handle the issue. \"It's going to have to come from private industry and everything,\" Snelling said. But another voter, John Yarley, was for tossing the whole thing out. \"I'm not for Obamacare. I think that needs to be cut,\" he said. After packing the fair over the weekend, it looks like Texas voters are packing the polls. Early voting started Monday and early reports show voter turnout appears to be breaking records.\u00a0About 55,384 voted in Dallas County on Monday, almost 26,000 more than were cast in 2014,\u00a0according to The Dallas Morning News.",

Many of them are accomplished by every modern civilized democracy in the western world.\" Ocasio-Cortez, who shocked New York's political establishment by unseating longtime Rep. Joe Crowley in a primary in June, cited the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany as countries with similar single-payer health systems. \"What we need to realize is that these investments are better and they are good for our future,\" she added. \"They are generational investments, not short-term bandaids. They are really profound decisions about who we want to be as a nation, and how we want to act as the wealthiest nation in the history of the world.\" Host Jake Tapper noted that according to \"left-leaning\" analysts, Ocasio-Cortez's plan for universal Medicare would end up costing more than $30 trillion dollars, even after factoring in the sweeping tax hikes that would offset the expense by only roughly $2 trillion. STUDY SHOWS BERNIE SANDERS' 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' BILL WOULD COST NEARLY $32 TRILLION One study, released in July by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposed 'Medicare for all' solution would\u00a0increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, and require historic tax increases. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have countered that while spending would necessarily increase in the short-term, fundamentally restructuring Medicare would ultimately yield sustained economic benefits by reducing administrative inefficiencies, cutting perscription drug costs, and encouraging young people to put more money into the economy. But Charles Blahous, a senior strategist at the Mercatus Center and an author of the study, has said Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders would need to make unrealistic assumptions to come to that conclusion, because increased demand for healthcare would potentially offset any such administrative gains. He criticized the two for making comments that \"appear to reflect a misunderstanding of my study\" after they cited his work as proof that 'Medicare for all' would, in fact, necessarily save money. Numerous fact-checkers, including The Washington Post and FactCheck, concluded that both liberal politicians had misread the paper's conclusions. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez aren't the only candidates pushing similar health care proposals. Presidential contenders, including Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., endorsed a universal Medicare program last year. There were signs, however, that enthusiasm for Ocasio-Cortez's brand of progressivism has faltered lately, even on her home turf. In Thursday's gubernatorial primary, Gov. Cuomo handily beat back a challenge by far-left insurgent progressive\u00a0Cynthia Nixon, who was endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez. So-called \"resistance\" candidates also fell in the races for\u00a0lieutenant governor and attorney general, although a democratic socialist candidate with a disputed past triumphed in her race for a state Senate seat. On Friday, Cuomo downplayed the notion that socialism is on the rise, and also seemingly took some personal shots at both Ocasio-Cortez and Nixon, a former \"Sex and the City\" star. DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST TORCHBEARERS FLAME OUT, DESPITE HIGH-PROFILE ENDORSEMENTS \u201cThat is a revolution,\u201d Cuomo said, referring to his double-digit win over Nixon. \u201cThat is a wave. On the numbers. Not on some Twittersphere dialogue where I tweet you and you tweet me and between the two of us, we think we have a wave. We\u2019re not even a ripple.\u201d He added, \"New York Democrats, these are hard-working men and women, they\u2019re middle class, they\u2019re working families, they have real problems, and they need real help in life, and they don\u2019t need theoretical or abstract solutions, they need real solutions in their lives.\" As for Ocasio-Cortez, Cuomo flatly declared: \"I am not a socialist. I am not 25 years old. I am not a newcomer. But I am a progressive, and I deliver progressive results.\" On Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez demurred when Tapper asked her about Cuomo's comments and the losses for progressives across New York last week. \"Well, I mean, I'm always down to go toe-to-toe sometimes, but I think when you actually look at the numbers we focused on, every single down-ballot progressive candidate in my district, New York 14, won.\" When Tapper pointed out that Nixon, whom Ocasio-Cortez had endorsed, lost that district by thirty percentage points, the Democratic socialist insisted, \"right, right, but we focused on our local candidates and we focused on the legislatures.\" Ocasio-Cortez concluded by suggesting that \"all parties\" are entitled to due process in the wake of an unverified and anonymous allegation, leaked recently by Democrats, concerning alleged improper sexual behavior by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh decades ago. But Ocasio-Cortez, pressed by Tapper as to whether Kavanaugh's nomination should justifiably be derailed by an anonymous accuser, made clear she doesn't think due process is a two-way street. \"One of the aspects of due process is that we have to hear these things out, and he should certainly not be confirmed until this is explored,\" Ocasio-Crotez said. \"I think that really, when we talk about process, and due process and justice, it must center on the victim. I cannot say what should be done or should not be done, but what we need to make sure there is that there is due justice for the victim in this case.\" Fox News' Adam Shaw and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.",

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday laid out a grand vision late Tuesday after it appeared her party was poised to regain control of the House of Representatives.

AMERICA WILL GET NANCY PELOSI'S SAN FRANCISCO VALUES IF DEMOCRATS TAKE THE HOUSE \u201cIt\u2019s about stopping the GOP and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell\u2019s assault on Medicare and Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the health care of 130 million Americans living with pre-existing medical conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about stopping the GOP and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell\u2019s assault on Medicare and Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the health care of 130 million Americans living with pre-existing medical conditions.\u201d Pelosi vowed that a House controlled by Democrats will work on behalf of ordinary Americans to make health care more affordable, raise workers\u2019 wages, and reinvest in infrastructure to \u201ccreate more good-paying jobs, (rebuild) roads, bridges schools, water systems, broadband networks, schools and housing and beyond.\u201d Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California gesture after speaking to party volunteers and supporters Tuesday. (Associated Press) Pelosi promised a transparent and open Democratic House \u201cso that the public can see what\u2019s happening and how it affects them and that they can weigh in with the members of Congress and with the president of the United States.\" \u201cWe will have accountability, and we will strive for bipartisanship with fairness on all sides. We will have a responsibility to find our common ground where we can (and) stand our ground where we can\u2019t,\u201d said, adding:\u00a0\"We have a bipartisan marketplace of ideas that makes our democracy strong. We have all had enough with division.\" Not everyone was on board with Pelosi's ostensible calls for bipartisanship, with some on social media criticizing Pelosi's rhetoric for being too presumptuous, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. \"Pelosi is promising bipartisanship and Dems are nowhere near winning yet. They've learned nothing,\" wrote Nora Biettetimmons before the House had been called for the Democrats. \"Either straight-up resign, or tell me when in the last decade Republicans have showed even the remotest spirit of bipartisanship when they held the reins,\" wrote another user cited by the Chronicle. Later in her speech, Pelosi evoked the Founding Fathers: \u201cThe founders could never have imagined how vast our country would become, how many we would be, how different we would be from each other. But they knew we had to be one. Unity, unity for our country.\" She said the outcome of Tuesday's midterms was a restoration of the Founding Fathers\u2019 vision. \u201c[T]oday the American people have spoken to restore that vision. \u2026 The new Democratic majority will honor the vision of the founders, for a country \u2013 having a legitimate debate \u2013 but remembering that we are one country,\u201d she said. President Trump reportedly called Pelosi before midnight to congratulate her on the House victory.\u00a0Pelosi's deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill said the president acknowledged her call for bipartisanship.

            "article_content": "State Rep. Geoff Diehl won the primary to take on Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts. (AP Photo/Winslow Townson, File) Republicans in deep-blue Massachusetts selected pro-Trump State Rep. Geoff Diehl to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren in November, setting the stage for a contentious referendum on the first-term senator's national profile as she openly mulls a run for the presidency in 2020. Diehl triumphed over\u00a0attorney John Kingston, and Beth Lindstrom, an aide to former Gov. Mitt Romney, with early results showing him with a convincing double-digit lead over his rivals. Of the three candidates, Diehl had the closest ties to President Donald Trump. Diehl co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign. He was quick to note that despite its liberal reputation, Massachusetts gave Trump one of his most lopsided early primary wins. Warren, who has served in the Senate since 2013, ran unopposed in Tuesday's Democratic primary. She released ten years worth of tax returns recently, laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run in 2020. Warren hasn't yet declared her intention to run, saying she's wanted to focus on her reelection first. But she has clearly floated the possibility of pursuing the White House,\u00a0saying in August she's not afraid to be \"the underdog.\" President Trump repeatedly has unloaded on his prospective rival, saying she lied about having Native American roots to help her legal career and\u00a0vowing to toss a heritage test at her during a presidential debate. Fox News has ranked the November race as\u00a0likely Democrat. Meanwhile, Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker on Tuesday soundly defeated ultraconservative challenger Scott Lively on his way to seeking a second four-year term in office, overcoming charges that he is too moderate as Republicans seek to maintain their hold on New England's governorships. He's set to face 47-year-old Ohio native Jay Gonzalez, the Democratic nominee for governor, in November. A former official in the administration of Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, Gonzales has hammered Baker on the deficiencies in the state's mass transit system and called for stronger protections for immigrants. 'REAL INDIAN' RUNNING AS INDEPENDENT AGAINST WARREN SUES AFTER STATE TELLS HIM TO STOP CALLING HER 'FAKE INDIAN' But despite Massachusetts' longstanding reputation as a deeply liberal state, Baker commands sky-high approval ratings there and ranks among the nation's most popular governors. He largely ignored Lively, a staunch supporter of President Trump. Democratic Rep. Richard Neal flips a coin to determine speaking order as challenger Tahirah Amatul-Wadud looks on before their primary debate at WGBY TV in Springfield, Mass., Thursday, Aug. 30, 2018. (AP) Baker credited in part his willingness to work cooperatively with Democratic leaders at the Statehouse. He is a progressive Republican, and supports universal healthcare and greater state investments in transportation and education. Republicans currently hold the governorships of four out of six states in highly liberal New England, including Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and are looking to grow that number in November. Also on Tuesday, in a major upset,\u00a0Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley\u00a0defeated 10-term incumbent Rep.\u00a0Michael Capuano.\u00a0Pressley, expected to be the first black woman elected to represent Massachusetts in Congress because she's set to run unopposed in November, had the backing of Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And Rep. Richard Neal defeated Democratic primary challenger Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, an attorney who had hoped to make history herself by becoming the first Muslim elected to Congress from Massachusetts. She backed a proposal to make Medicare available to all Americans regardless of age. Neal will run unopposed in November.

            "article_content": "FBN\u2019s Trish Regan discusses how Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) downplayed the strength of the U.S. economy. HAMPTON, N.H. \u2013 Anyone looking for signs that Nancy Pelosi has lost clout within the Democratic ranks this cycle need only catch a glimpse of last week\u2019s candidate forum in New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District. When 10 Democratic candidates were asked if they\u2019d support the House minority leader for speaker if elected and the Democrats regain the chamber\u2019s majority, only one raised his hand. Their hesitation speaks to a growing uneasiness among this year\u2019s midterm candidates \u2013 especially in swing districts \u2013\u00a0with the veteran California Democrat\u2019s grip on power. In New Hampshire, the candidates\u2019 response on the Pelosi question was telling given the nature of the electorate. The seat in play, currently held by retiring Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, represents a swing district in a swing state. Perceived Pelosi ties could hurt the Democrats\u2019 bid to hold the seat in the fall. In Pennsylvania, Democrat Conor Lamb surely made similar calculations earlier this year when he vowed not to support Pelosi for speaker \u2013 and went on to win a special election in a deep-red district that President Trump carried in 2016 by 20 percentage points. With his defiance, Lamb started a trend \u2013 seen in the New Hampshire forum and races across the country. Since then, some 20 Democratic congressional challengers in districts controlled by Republicans have publicly distanced themselves from Pelosi. Among them are Clarke Tucker, the Democratic nominee in Arkansas\u2019s 2nd District who declared in a TV commercial that \u201cI\u2019ve said from day one that I won\u2019t vote for Nancy Pelosi.\u201d Dan McCready, the Democratic nominee in North Carolina\u2019s 9th District, said earlier this spring, \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change and that starts at the top.\u201d And Dan Kohl, the Democratic challenger in Wisconsin\u2019s 6th District, told Fox6 in April that \"if I'm elected to Congress, I would not vote for Nancy Pelosi as leader of the Democrats.\" Whether the rank-and-file rejection might actually imperil Pelosi\u2019s bid for the gavel \u2013 if Democrats take the House \u2013 remains to be seen. But the statements reflect a growing midterm strategy of Democratic candidates distancing themselves from the longtime liberal leader. This, as President Trump and fellow Republicans try to cast Pelosi \u2013 along with far-left colleagues like Californian Maxine Waters, who stirred controversy over the weekend with her call to harass Trump Cabinet officials \u2013 as the 2018 \u201cface\u201d of the party. Pelosi, 78, has led the House Democrats for 15 years and after her party won back control of the chamber in 2006, she made history as the first female speaker. The San Francisco politician lost the speakership after the 2010 election, when the GOP took back the House. Two years ago, she was challenged for House Democratic leader by Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, one of a number of younger lawmakers pushing for fresh leadership. But Pelosi defeated Ryan by a more than two-to-one margin. In early May, Pelosi put to rest any doubts she would run for speaker again if the Democrats flip the 24 GOP House seats needed to retake the majority, telling the Boston Globe \"we will win. I will run for speaker. I feel confident about it. And my members do, too.\u201d Only one of 10 candidates at last week's New Hampshire District 1 forum raised his hand to indicate support for Nancy Pelosi as speaker. (Paul Steinhauser) Asked about her chances to regain the speakership, Pelosi recently told Rolling Stone, \"I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I am confident.\" Further, Pelosi has suggested she\u2019s not bothered at all by Democratic candidates distancing themselves from her \u2013 assuming a whatever-it-takes-to-win attitude. \"It doesn't bother me,\" she told Rolling Stone. \"I just want them to win.\u201d Spokesman Drew Hammill stressed that Pelosi enjoys support among sitting Democratic lawmakers: \u201cLeader Pelosi has always enjoyed the overwhelming support of House Democrats and that will continue into the majority she\u2019s so focused on winning.\u00a0 Democrats don\u2019t let Republicans choose our leaders.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s ambition to reclaim the gavel has excited Republicans. Their playbook over the years has been to attack her and tie Democratic candidates to her. This year, the party has targeted her for her opposition to the Republican tax bill signed into law by Trump in December. Trump, in February, described Pelosi as a \u201csecret weapon\u201d for Republicans as they try to hold onto the House. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a major outside group that aims to keep the GOP\u2019s House majority, has vowed to spend big bucks targeting Pelosi. \u201cNancy Pelosi is by far the most toxic politician in the country, and we continue to see her toxicity increase. CLF will spend millions of dollars reminding voters just how bad Nancy Pelosi is for the country,\u201d CLF Communications Director Courtney Alexander said. Pelosi remains a fundraising force for her party. She raised an eye-popping $16.1 million the first three months of this year, with the vast majority of cash headed to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The DCCC is reserving millions in TV ad time for candidates, even those who are not supporting Pelosi. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, the DCCC chairman, recently told Politico that he \u201ctrusts our candidates\u201d when it comes to supporting Pelosi. Ryan, who challenged Pelosi in 2016, told Fox News: \u201cI actually think those who make the decision not to support Pelosi, that it\u2019s an opportunity to look independent, to look detached from the partisanship that\u2019s got us locked in where we are today.\u201d \u201cThey can look like a new kind of Democrat, an independent-minded Democrat. And I think that has its benefits in projecting that kind of independent streak,\u201d the Ohio congressman added. But the National Republican Congressional Committee has a very different take. \u201cIt\u2019s a pathetic attempt to distance themselves from the embattled minority leader,\u201d NRCC national press secretary Jesse Hunt told Fox News. \u201cVoters will find it very disingenuous in the fall when candidates try to utter these sorts of claims when they welcome her financial support and support the same polices that Pelosi supports.\u201d Meanwhile, while Pelosi faces friction with Democrats seeking support from moderates, she also is grappling with elements of the party who want her to push further left. Her lack of an endorsement for a sweeping \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan has angered progressives, as has her pushback against talk by Democratic firebrands of impeaching Trump. \u201cShe has done an okay job for her tenure, but I think it\u2019s time to get people who want Medicare for All,\u201d Democratic candidate Mindi Messmer, running in New Hampshire\u2019s 1st District, told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s time to have some new leadership, in my opinion.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The long 2018 political primary season has finally ended, exposing deep divisions between mainstream Democrats and those on the far left, including some who proudly call themselves democratic socialists. Now many in the party will seek to downplay their divisions and unite for victories in the Nov. 6 midterm elections. Heading into the midterms, the mainstream Democrats say they are in the best position to win the support of moderates in their own party, along with critically important independent swing voters and even some Republicans disenchanted with President Trump. This has been the strategy followed by many candidates of both parties in the past \u2013 develop a centrist message with broad appeal. But those on the far left argue that they are in the best position to win in November because they will fire up the Democratic base and motivate millions of people who normally don\u2019t vote in midterm elections to turn out and cast ballots for Democrats. High voter turnout more often than not works in the favor of Democratic candidates on Election Day. Despite their divisions, the Democratic factions have far more in common with each other than they do with Republicans \u2013 particularly Republicans who strongly support President Trump. Both Democratic camps want their party to achieve majority control in both chambers of Congress and to pick up more governorships, state legislative seats, and other state offices in the midterm elections. They just have different ideas about how to achieve their common goal. And both moderate and progressive Democratic factions are intensely opposed to President Trump \u2013 to his policies and to the man himself, based on his conduct. A significant number of Democrats would like to see the president impeached and removed from office. The Democrats can enhance their chances of victory in November if they offer voters a clear policy agenda that is distinct and more compelling than what the Trump administration and Republicans have to offer. In the midst of the primary season in the summer, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that Americans \u2013 when asked if the Democratic Party stood for something or only in opposition to President Trump \u2013 said by a 52-37 percent margin that Democrats were the anti-Trump party. While some voters so detest Trump that they will vote for just about any Democratic congressional candidate in hopes of impeaching the president \u2013 or at least blocking his agenda and launching congressional investigations of his conduct \u2013 \u00a0millions of Americans want to know what candidates stand for \u2013 not just who and what they stand against. The challenge both moderate and progressive Democratic candidates face between now and Nov. 6 will be to clearly articulate what they stand for and convince voters their policies are practical, achievable and beneficial. This year\u2019s primary season ended Thursday in heavily Democratic New York, where the Democratic divide was on full display. It is clear that Democrats are far more energized than they have been in a long time. Polls indicate this as well. Mainstream Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, his lieutenant governor and the candidate he favored for attorney general all defeated opponents farther on the left on the political spectrum, and all are now expected to be elected in November. Cuomo won by an impressive 32 points over his well-publicized but poorly funded more progressive rival, former \u201cSex and the City\u201d actress Cynthia Nixon. To be sure, the enthusiastic challenge from Nixon resulted in her receiving over 512,000 votes \u2013almost three times the amount Zephyr Teachout received in her 2014 left-wing challenge to Cuomo for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. But Cuomo won more than 978,000 votes Thursday. Teachout ran for attorney general in a hotly contested Democratic primary but lost to Cuomo\u2019s choice for attorney general, Letitia James, by 10 points in a field of four candidates. Cuomo\u2019s success went even farther, as his lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, beat her more progressive opponent, New York City Councilman Jumaane Williams, by six points. Nevertheless, a detailed look at these primary results indicates a much greater level of vulnerability for the Democratic Party. Although Cuomo won a decisive victory, a solid third of the vote went to Nixon, who was able to turn out thousands more voters than previous challengers to Cuomo. This is strikingly and notably similar to the recent U.S. Senate race in Delaware, where former governor and current senator Tom Carper captured 65 percent of the vote \u2013 down from 88 percent in his last primary. Democratic primaries like these are showing that the power of the left \u2013 while not as strong as the national media have made it out to be \u2013 remains strong, enduring, and raises questions about the midterm elections, and even beyond to 2020. Given the strength of some of the progressive challengers who have won Democratic primaries this year to run in November \u2013 including Andrew Gillum for governor in Florida; Stacey Abrams for governor or Georgia; and Ayanna Pressley for a U.S. House seat from Massachusetts \u2013 it is clear that Democrats are far more energized than they have been in a long time. Polls indicate this as well. However, the primaries on Thursday also continued the streak of well-publicized progressive defeats. At this point it\u2019s unknown if disappointed progressive Democrats will turn out in November to vote for more moderate Democratic candidates in order to defeat Republicans. The other more enduring question is how strong and united the Democratic Party will be in 2020, particularly if a far-left candidate runs for president. Right now, former Vice President Joe Biden seems to be the strongest Democratic candidate, though it is possible Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., or Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., could mount a credible challenge. Notably, even in states where the far-left fell short in the primaries, it was rare that the vote for progressive candidates fell below 35 percent. The clear surge of progressive candidates in the Democratic Party has caused candidates like Cuomo to move left on issues like legalizing marijuana and empowering felons to vote. What remains unclear is if this trend will result in a sustained leftward shift in the November elections this year, and in the general election in 2020. Leon Panetta, the former nine-term Democratic congressman and who served for 16 years as a top official in the Clinton and Obama administrations, said Democrats are \u201cgoing through turmoil trying to settle on a vision.\u201d \u201cVery frankly, it\u2019s a party of a lot of very different voices right now,\u201d Panetta said. There is every reason to believe the energy and enthusiasm in the party is moving left, and ample evidence that Medicare-for-all, jobs-for-all, and a $15 minimum wage is the direction that the party\u2019s platform is heading towards. Just recently, former President Obama endorsed progressive ideas like Medicare-for-all, which has become almost a uniting rallying cry of the most left-leaning Democratic candidates. Yet not all Democrats support such leftist policy platforms. What will these moderate Democrats do in November if the Democratic candidates on their ballots are on the far-left side of their party? What will independents and moderate Republicans do? Will the most progressive Democrats succeed in increasing voter turnout? We\u2019ll have the answers on the night of Nov. 6 and the early hours of Nov. 7, when the general election votes are tallied.",

            "article_content": "Despite losing election after election, the far-left wing of the Democratic Party appears to be growing in strength and is dragging the rest of the party ever closer to the failed political and economic system of socialism. This strategy won\u2019t help Democrats win general elections \u2013 moderate Democrats and independents don\u2019t want to have anything to do with socialism. But the move to left-wing radicalism is clearly having an impact on many members of the party and the candidates they select in primaries to face off against Republicans in the Nov. 6 midterm elections. For a growing number of Democratic candidates, being labeled a socialist is no longer considered an attack and an insult. It\u2019s considered a compliment that will help them win primaries. But the problem for these candidates is that winning a primary is meaningless if they go on to lose on Election Day in November. A Gallup poll released in August found only 47 percent of Democrats have a favorable opinion of capitalism, compared to\u00a057 percent\u00a0who said they have a positive view of socialism. That\u2019s astounding and a historic departure from the party\u2019s traditional opposition to the spread of socialism and communism around the world \u2013 and to its support of the free enterprise system, personal freedoms and civil liberties here at home. The Democrats\u2019 sharp leftward tilt in just the last few years is disturbing.\u00a0Socialism is a radical, oppressive, dangerous ideology.\u00a0It calls for the complete destruction of property rights and the end of many individual rights, especially religious freedom. In fact, Karl Marx, the most famous socialist in the history of the world, openly called for the \u201cabolition of private property\u201d and a tyrannical revolution. And he was a militant atheist who called religion \u201cthe opium of the people.\u201d Millions of people have died in the past 100 years \u2013 some by violence, some by starvation \u2013 in Russia, China, Eastern Europe, Cuba and other nations when Marxist revolutionaries seized power and ruthlessly held on to it, ignoring the rule of law and individual rights. Americans fought and died in the Korean and Vietnam Wars \u2013 begun under Democratic presidents \u2013 to stop the spread of communism. Gillum\u2019s socialist ideas are a massive departure from the policies Floridians usually support in their elections. In 2016 Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Florida and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio defeated his Democratic challenger by 700,000 votes. Yet now \u2013 when much of Eastern Europe has embraced capitalism, the Berlin Wall and East Germany have disappeared, the Soviet Union has broken up into separate nations, and even Russia and China have embraced some elements of capitalism to strengthen their economies \u2013 radical Democrats want to go against the tide of history and move toward the socialist system that other nations have abandoned in droves. Although many Democrats who say they support \u201csocialism\u201d probably have the mixed-market economies of Europe in mind (that\u2019s not really socialism), there are a number of Democrats who are Marxists. For instance, the highly influential Democratic Socialists of America, a group whose membership includes Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York City, advocates for the end of capitalism and the\u00a0collective ownership of property. Other Democrats, while not calling themselves socialists, are taking far-left positions that embrace elements of socialism and are winning primaries. The latest candidate to do this is Boston City Council member Ayanna Pressley, who won an upset victory over 10-term U.S. Rep. Michael Capuano in the Massachusetts Democratic primary Tuesday. Pressley was endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez and by Our Revolution, the offshoot of the Democratic presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who calls himself a democratic socialist. Pressley supports Medicare-for-all health insurance and closing nearly every coal and natural gas power plant in the country by 2035. Another example of a far-left Democratic candidate winning a recent primary is Andrew Gillum, who became the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Aug. 28. Gillum is the mayor of Tallahassee and a charismatic 39-year-old. Gillum \u2013 who would be Florida\u2019s first black governor if he is elected in November \u2013 was considered a longshot to win his party\u2019s nomination. But after receiving key endorsements from left-wing groups and orchestrating a massive grassroots effort, he managed to beat out several better-funded and better-known candidates. In many ways, Gillum seems like an odd choice for Florida Democrats and even odder choice for the state\u2019s electorate as a whole. Gillum is a socialist-leaning Democrat who received the endorsement of Bernie Sanders. He supports far-left policies like raising taxes on businesses, imposing a single-payer health-care system in Florida, and transitioning Florida \u201cto clean energy as rapidly as possible\u201d by sending huge amounts of taxpayer funds to solar companies to battle climate change. Gillum also thinks carbon dioxide is a\u00a0\u201cpollutant,\u201d\u00a0and he supports a slew of new regulations and mandates for gun owners. These policies might be attractive in certain parts of California and Vermont, but they are a far cry from the policies of Gillum\u2019s much more conservative and pro-business Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis. Gillum\u2019s socialist ideas are also a massive departure from the policies Floridians usually support in their elections. In 2016 Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Florida and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio defeated his Democratic challenger by 700,000 votes. Pressley, Gillum, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders currently appear to be the future of the Democratic Party, and that should shock and horrify anyone who believes in individual liberty and conserving the ideas that have helped to make America the world\u2019s most powerful and prosperous nation.",

            "article_content": "Ohio Republican thanks family, supporters and President Trump after tight race for Ohio's 12th Congressional District; pledges to keep America great. Buoyed by a dramatic last-minute rally by President Trump, Republican State Sen. Troy Balderson appeared to be inching closer to beating back a challenge by insurgent Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor in Ohio's special election for a vacant House seat Tuesday. A victory in the race for Ohio's historically conservative 12th Congressional District would deny Democrats the major upset they had sought ahead of the November midterm elections. The winner takes the seat previously held by Republican Pat Tiberi, who resigned in January to take another job. Speaking to cheering supporters Tuesday night, Balderson said O'Connor ran a \"hard race\" and claimed victory. And in a tweet Tuesday night, Trump wrote that Balderson had won a \"great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting.\" But O'Connor has not conceded, and said in a statement released shortly before midnight that \"we don't know the results quite yet.\" The race remains too close to call. Balderson maintains a slim one-percentage point lead with all precincts reporting, but there are at least 3,435 provisional ballots left to be reviewed and 5,048 outstanding absentee ballots. That's enough for O'Connor to potentially pick up enough votes to force a mandatory recount. Unofficial Ohio state election totals showed Balderson with 101,574 votes and O'Connor with 99,820 -- a mere 1,754 vote difference. State officials said that boards of elections cannot begin counting those additional ballots until the 11th\u00a0day after the election, August 18. The mood at O'Connor's campaign headquarters at the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association in Westerville had been optimistic early Tuesday evening as results intially indicated he was significantly ahead in Ohio's 12th Congressional District. Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in 2016, and it has had a Republican representative for the last three decades. The race was one of several key contests\u00a0on Tuesday, but it has garnered outsized attention because several polls showed no real daylight between the candidates in traditionally deep-red district -- which some, including Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has said \"does not bode well\"\u00a0for the GOP in the upcoming November midterm elections. Also, while Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, and Washington state were holding primaries on Tuesday, only Ohio was sending someone to Congress immediately. Despite the apparent win by Balderson, 57, on Tuesday,\u00a0the candidates will square off again in less than 100 days in November's general election. But O'Connor is expected to have much less of a fighting chance -- and outside funding -- in the fall. Trump Tuesday night predicted on Twitter that Balderson will \"win BIG\" in November's general election. Late Tuesday, as it became clear Balderson had a lead with all precincts reporting, O'Connor sounded a determined but somber note in a speech at his campaign headquarters. \"This is a grassroots campaign powered by small donations and people who want the future for their community,\" he said. \"We won\u2019t rest; we will keep fighting through to November.\" FOUR OTHER STATES HEAD TO THE POLLS ON TUESDAY -- WHAT ARE THE KEY RACES? A state Republican party official told Fox News that officials there were \"cautiously optimistic\" Balderson would prevail early in the evening, citing high turnout in areas like rural Muskingum County that nearly ran out of paper ballots. Trump may have played a significant role in the reportedly high turnout in the Ohio contest by staging a freewheeling rally in suburban Columbus on Saturday night. In a sweltering auditorium, Trump said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., \"controls Danny O\u2019Connor, whoever the hell that is.\" In his tweet Tuesday night, Trump wrote, \"When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson, he was down in early voting 64 to 36. That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better.\" Described by campaign operatives as a \"Whole Foods\" district, the largely suburban region features a more affluent and educated voter base than the typical Trump stronghold. Balderson touted Trump's help, saying Monday that the president \"definitely brought major excitement, and they were excited to see him up here.\" \"We won\u2019t rest; we will keep fighting through to November.\" Vice President Mike Pence also campaigned on Balderson's behalf, saying he has been on board with the president's agenda. O'Connor has dominated Balderson on the local airwaves. His campaign spent $2.25 million on advertising compared to Balderson's $507,000, according to campaign tallies of ad spending. The Republican campaign arm and its allied super PAC were forced to pick up the slack, spending more than $4 million between them. Kasich, a leading voice in the GOP's shrinking anti-Trump wing, once represented the district in Congress. At times, the race has centered on Trump's tax cuts as much as the candidates. O'Connor and his Democratic allies have railed against the tax plan, casting it as a giveaway for the rich that exacerbates federal deficits and threatens Medicare and Social Security. Democrats have also hammered Balderson for telling a local newspaper that he would consider raising the eligibility age for Medicare and Social Security.

            "article_content": "Former FBI Director James Comey, left, and Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. (AP) Former FBI Director James Comey waded back into the political fray on Twitter Sunday, warning Democrats not to \"rush to the socialist left\" in upcoming elections. \"Democrats, please, please don\u2019t lose your minds,\" Comey wrote. \"This president and his Republican Party are counting on you to do exactly that. America's great middle wants sensible, balanced, ethical leadership.\" Last week, Comey urged voters to back Democrats in November's midterm elections, tweeting that Republicans had proven \"incapable of fulfilling the Founders\u2019 design that 'Ambition must \u2026 counteract ambition.'\" Comey's latest tweet appeared to be a response to the rise of New York City congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old former bartender who defeated House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley in a primary last month. Since then Ocasio-Cortez has emerged as a star of the so-called \"democratic socialist\" movement, having made several media appearances and campaigned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in support of primary challengers. The Democratic Socialists of America has endorsed 42 candidates for office at the federal, state and local levels in 20 states --including Florida, Hawaii, Kansas and Michigan. Allie Cohn, a member of the DSA's national political team, told The Associated Press this weekend that the group's paid membership has reached 45,000 nationwide. In the years before President Trump's election, that number hovered around 6,000. The most ambitious Democrats in Washington have been reluctant to embrace the label, even as they embrace the policies defining modern-day democratic socialism: Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, free college tuition and the abolition of the federal department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE. Republicans, meanwhile, are encouraged by the rise of democratic socialism \u2014 for a far different reason. They have seized on what they view as a leftward lurch by Democrats they predict will alienate voters this fall and in the 2020 presidential race. The Republican National Committee eagerly notes that Sanders' plan to provide free government-sponsored health care for all Americans had no co-sponsors in 2013. Today, more than one-third of Senate Democrats and two-thirds of House Democrats have signed onto the proposal, which by one estimate could cost taxpayers as much as $32 trillion. The co-sponsors include some 2020 presidential prospects, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Those senators aren't calling themselves democratic socialists but also not disassociating themselves from the movement's priorities. Most support the push to abolish ICE, which enforces immigration laws and led the Trump administration's recent push to separate immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border. Of the group, only Booker hasn't called for ICE to be abolished, replaced or rebuilt. Yet Booker's office notes that he's among the few senators backing a plan to guarantee government-backed jobs to unemployed adults in high-unemployment communities across America. \"Embracing socialist policies like government-run health care, a guaranteed jobs program and open borders will only make Democrats more out of touch,\" RNC Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel said.

            "article_content": "To prevent mass shootings, we need to open ourselves up to uncomfortable ideas, ones that take us out our rigid teams. This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" November 8, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Dagen McDowell, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" A mass shooting, this time in Thousand Oaks, California, 12 dead including a police officer, Ron Helus, who gave his life for others. Here are his fellow officers paying respect to their fallen brother on the 101. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (INAUDIBLE) (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Now, there is no shortage of ideas when it comes to preventing such horror. The problem is the loudest voices only offered two choices. \u00a0It's either you want more gun control or you want to arm everyone. We need to escape this prison of two ideas. Here's how. One, we need a system that works. We once had a process for dealing with people who had a known mental illness but the process is now paralyzed by fear. People don't want to be pegged as violating someone else's rights. Today, psychiatric hospitals house less than a tenth of the people they did in the 1950's. \u00a0Yet, our population has doubled. If we can't house them, then at least tag them so they can't get a gun. The shooter terrified his mom. That's what we call a red flag. Two, we need an industry focused on hardening soft targets. A shooter's body count is limited by the time it takes for a second weapon to arrive. \u00a0Enhanced security can only reduce that time. Three, finally the media must limit the persuasive power of its coverage. Studies of suicides verify the copy-cat phenomenon. With mass shooting the spotlight is no help. \u00a0Religious and political terror has an ideology. Criminal homicide has a payoff, it's often revenge or profit. This is the only terror that exists as an end in itself. We can stop it but to do that, we need to open ourselves up to uncomfortable ideas, ones that take us out of our rigid teams. You know, Dana, when you look -- you see reoccurring red flags in these cases that are just -- kind of infuriating but you know that it is hard to find a needle in a haystack. But when a needle -- when the mother is terrified, when the person has been visited by experts because of psychiatric problems, you got to ask yourself how could this happen. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: And it is -- you know, the synagogue shooting, that shooter was a radicalized anti-Semite, evil person. Was he mentally ill as well? I don't know. GUTFELD: Yeah. PERINO: For this individual, the deputies were called to the house because the mother was worried. GUTFELD: Right. PERINO: The deputy say, you know what, I think we should call in, following procedure, the psychiatrist to come in and do an evaluation. \u00a0They come, they do this evaluation. Do it to the best of their ability. \u00a0And at the end of it they say our professional opinion is that he's not a harm to himself or to others at this time. GUTFELD: Right. PERINO: And there's human error that's going to be involved in this and we also have the issue of liberty in this country. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: So how do we figure out how to deal with this? You're exactly right. This is the thorny problem. We don't seem to ever actually get past talking about it being a thorny problem though. GUTFELD: Yeah. It's the -- Jesse, it is the OK. If people say we need to do something about guns, then people go, no, more gun control. And if you say I think we need more self-defense, you will say you just want to arm everybody with guns. But there is a place somewhere in the middle that could solve this problem. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Yeah. Mr. Pollock, remember Meadows -- GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: -- father down in Parkland, he tweeted -- kind of along the lines that you've been talking about. Don't all of a sudden rush to take everyone's guns away. You have to look at mental health, you have to look at security, and you have to look at soft targets, because California is probably one of the strictest gun control states out there. And the city, third safest city in California, so if this could happen there, this could happen anywhere. And if you think about what Dana was just saying, if you have multiple police contacts at the house, neighbors that were concerned, law enforcement concerned that he was terrorizing his mother, terrorizing himself. Possibly harming himself, one neighbor says. And there is thought of PTSD involved. If you go and send this guy to a mental health professional and the mental health professional then just checks this box, it's similar to what happened again in the Parkland shooter again. GUTFELD: Exactly. WATTERS: This guy, you know, he's off the charts insane and they give him a clean bill of health. These mental health professionals, I'm not blaming them, but they have to address the modalities that they're going through when they see is this person a threat? Because they're letting off a lot of people that then go out and shoot people. We have this guy, he was a machine gunner in Afghanistan. I mean, he saw some nasty stuff. GUTFELD: Yeah. WATTERS: And he's probably done some nasty stuff. So maybe you get a guy like this, if he's really seen a lot of action, and he's already a loner, we knew that, went through divorce, living with his mom, not a great matrix there. Maybe there's a mandatory mental health evaluation that you have to do at the VA every single year if you have a profile like this. You go in, they check you out, they address your mental capacities, and then maybe they can sign off on something because right now there's too many people slipping through the cracks. PERINO: I just think there's -- the veteran's community is concerned about tagging people that have PTSD with violence like this, and for good reason, right? Because, one, we don't know if there's an exact length. There could be mental health problems from before. And also, there's already stigma enough if you have PTSD in terms of getting treatment. It's not something we shouldn't talk about -- WATTERS: Maybe you don't take his gun away. Maybe you put him in some sort of program where he can talk about these issues -- PERINO: Yeah. WATTERS: -- and may be get medicated or anything that could help solve the problem. DAGEN MCDOWELL, CO-HOST: Can I just point out, though, to your point, Jesse, the gun laws in California are the strictest. And there are laws on the books in California for this man's family and any person's family to deal with this and get a gun or guns out of the hands of someone who is a threat to themselves or other people. There're multiple ways to do that in the state of California. One, if a person is taken into custody, evaluated by mental health professionals, and admitted to accounting mental health facility because that person was found to be a danger to themselves or others, it is generally prohibited from possessing or acquiring firearms for five years in California. And then, the state of California was the first to introduced gun violence restraining orders four years ago to give a legal path to family members and even law enforcement officers to get a gun out of somebody's hands. \u00a0And this has been the case with potential suicide or violence to others, but there're mechanisms in place that in this case were not used. GUTFELD: I had no idea that that was already in place. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yes. So I just want to pick up on the top of your monologue which was that we get locked in a box in terms of conversation that we have in this country, because I thought that was so important that people either say, oh, no gun control or gun control, right? \u00a0I just want to also point out, as Dana said, this man had been interviewed by health care professionals and found not to be a threat to himself or others, so it's not the case that there hadn't been attention. And I would also say, I think, it's very important to say that people who have mental illness are not of a greater proclivity to commit gun violence. There's no evidence between gun violence and mental illness in this country. So, to me, what's important is that we acknowledge we have too many guns in this country, and it makes for a problem not only for gun violence but for suicide, in particular. So I want to say gun violence, I mean, gun violence against others. The other thing that I think is really important is that there are points where we can agree as Americans and I wish we would get to that. It's overwhelming. If you ask Americans about background checks, universal background checks, Americans say yes, including gun owners. NRA members say yes, that's a great idea. Let's do it. Let's have a waiting period for people who get guns. GUTFELD: Did that stop -- he got this gun legally. I'm sure there was a background check. WILLIAMS: No. In this case, I'm sure there was. But remember, he was interviewed, as Dana said, by mental health professionals who couldn't -- who didn't have enough evidence in their minds to say put this guy away or deny him access. And that's another thing that if someone is found to be abusive of their spouse or mom in this case -- GUTFELD: Right. WILLIAMS: -- they should not be allowed to have a gun. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Universal background checks, assault weapons, and it seems to me that you have to have a sense that, again, how many guns can any one person have in a country? GUTFELD: I don't know how many guns -- PERINO: Well, it only takes one. GUTFELD: Yeah. Do you want to say something? MCDOWELL: No. I just wanted to say -- but families in that state and many other states, increasing number including Florida, after the Parkland shooting earlier this year, if you have an individual and your family who has a gun or guns and you -- there's a path legally to get that gun out of their hands, if you think that they're a violent threat. GUTFELD: Right, OK. And we just have to remember -- every day the dangers that the police endure -- this is what they do for a living. They rush towards the bullet. PERINO: He saved a lot of other people. GUTFELD: Yeah. WATTERS: Sergeant Ron Helus. GUTFELD: All right, up next, switching gears to the midterms, leftists comedian Chelsea Handler -- is she still a comedian? PERINO: No. GUTFELD: Attacks white women for not voting for Democrats, details ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: The left coming up with a long list of outrageous excuses for why there wasn't a massive blue wave in the midterms. Anti-Trump comedian Chelsea Handler trashing white women for not voting for Democrat candidate Beto O'Rourke in Texas, tweeting, quote, 59 percent of white women voted for Ted Cruz. I don't know what it is going to take for us to be sisters to other women, but we have to do better than this. We need to vote for the best interests of others and stop thinking only about ourselves. And fellow liberal Joy Behar get schooled after complaining about Democrats winning the popular vote but still losing in key senate races. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So Democrats won the popular vote last night by 8 million votes, right? They lose -- (APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- but they lose U.S. Senate races in red areas. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because of gerrymandering -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The districts are gerrymandered, but the states are part of the constitution. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) WATTERS: Can we play that again? That was fun to watch. Listen, Democrats won the House. They should be very excited -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: The thing is also -- the Democrats, there's a lot for them to be happy about -- WATTERS: Sure. PERINO: -- and for them to build on. This is their rebuilding year. GUTFELD: Right. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: This is my rebuilding year too. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: Be more than a year. WATTERS: Just like last year. PERINO: And the thing about Chelsea Handler is that -- it wasn't the white women that were the problem. It was the candidate that was the problem. \u00a0You cannot run far left progressive in a conservative state and expect to come out victorious. He didn't even try to moderate on any issues. Yes, he won those cities, if you look at Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, and many of the suburbs. But the rest of the state -- he didn't even try. \u00a0I know he visited every county. Honestly, if you look the same thing is happening in Georgia. WATTERS: Yep. PERINO: You run a progressive in a state that you're not going to be able to get all the way there. If they would have run a moderate Democrat, they might have beat Ted Cruz. They've proved he was beatable, but he wasn't beatable by this candidate. White women is not the problem. The candidate is the problem and his issue areas. WATTERS: Candidate quality, Greg. That's what Dana always says. GUTFELD: All right. First to the popular vote, imagine an NFL quarterback after a loss saying, but I threw more yards. Doesn't work that way. It helps the stats, but it doesn't help in the final score, OK. Now about the women, I think -- number one, Chelsea Handler should not be called a comedian anymore. She's a tragedy. And this is how identity politics implodes. If you don't conform to the group you're in, they kind of like take away your identity card. She's basically saying I am woman, hear me roar, unless you're Republican, then shut up. This is some interesting facts that I've got from the journal of political economy -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Oh, that's where my copy went. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: This is really interesting stuff. Women's voting habits tend to change. Women are way more liberal than men at the start. Marriage cuts the gap in half. When you have kids, the remaining difference disappears, right? Then you're just like your husband. But then, if you get a divorce, the woman actually ends up more liberal than before. Isn't that amazing? WATTERS: So you're saying women change their mind a lot. (LAUGHTER) WATTERS: Breaking news. GUTFELD: I think being exposed to different opinions and then having children -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: And divorced, you get angry. PERINO: Remember life of Julia. Remember when Obama administration -- GUTFELD: Oh, yes. PERINO: -- the government is going to be there for you when the man won't be. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: Oh, that's controversial. Well, I guess we just know that women's vote is up for grabs every single election. MCDOWELL: In terms of the candidate, didn't these ladies learn anything from Hillary Clinton? When Madeline Albright said there's a special place for women who don't support women. And that no amount of lecturing, and hectoring, and shrieking is going to convince a woman, don't tell us what to do. PERINO: Well, the other thing was they have liberal women from the northeast in California pouring money into Beto O'Rourke's campaign. You can't import voters there. Like, people in New York and California, they don't get to vote in Texas -- GUTFELD: Or do they. PERINO: -- unless they move there. WATTERS: Yeah. And what's he going to do with all that money? Does he get to keep that or -- PERINO: I think they spent a lot of it, but I believe he can roll it into -- if he runs for another federal office. MCDOWELL: That happen the moment -- WATTERS: Oh, 2020, everybody. MCDOWELL: Well, that happened the moment that the race was declared. It was Beto and Andrew Gillum. They want him to be his running mate. But in terms of Chelsea Handler, she's tragic. You know what? She'll be more effective right now just screaming into the belly of a porta-john. WILLIAMS: You're all talking about. I mean, she must have said something -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: But I'm just saying -- (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: The first thing to say is that -- by the way, gerrymandering does make a difference. Clearly, we talked about how Democrats had to defend more seats in the senate this time around so that they had a higher point to climb to in order to have success. In terms of the congressional races, gerrymandering does make a difference. That's why it's so important in terms of the governor's races -- PERINO: I know. But that's not what she was saying. She said -- WILLIAMS: She got confused and she was wrong, Dana. But I'm just saying, in fact, she's right when she says gerrymandering made a difference -- PERINO: In the house. WILLIAMS: -- midterm. It sure did. But the second point that I would make is, with regard to white women, you know, white women, actually, did very well by Democrats, especially suburban white women this time around. \u00a0Democrats wouldn't have won the house without white women. PERINO: It's true. WILLIAMS: So -- but here's the thing, I think lots of people are upset about two states in particular, Georgia and Florida, where you had two black candidates running. And I think the fear is there that the white women did not support black candidates and that they were upset about -- PERINO: But also, can I say -- (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Why is it the person? Why can't it be the issues? Like, I can be somebody and say like, OK, so they're for Medicare for all. I'm not for that. So, if I then being racist because I don't want to vote for Medicare -- Medicare for all? MCDOWELL: Medicare for all in Florida, if any senior paid attention. \u00a0Medicare for all means Medicare for not. They're all the bills in Washington. Get rid of Medicare as we know -- (CROSSTALK) MCDOWELL: So if they voted on the issue, they wouldn't vote for somebody in favor of Medicare for all. WILLIAMS: I'm sorry, that's exactly wrong. In fact, guess what, most American support this. So -- MCDOWELL: Because they don't understand it. WILLIAMS: So most Americans thinks that it's a good idea. Most Americans want more of what people in the past called Obamacare, actually, Affordable Care Act. People want the government involved in preventing them from going bankrupt when there's some catastrophic illness. WATTERS: I just don't know how much it has to do with race, Juan, because a lot of white women voted for Barack Obama in Florida twice. So I'm not so sure about that. Coming up, a radical left-wing mob targeting our own Tucker Carlson. Plus, Michael Moore says the current crop of Democrats don't stand a chance against Trump in 2020, next on The Five. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: With the midterms behind us, the spotlight now shifts to 2020. \u00a0Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore predicts a current group of potential Democratic contenders will not be able to defeat President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: Come up with a name. Just say the name right now. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Kamala Harris. MOORE: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why not? MOORE: Love her. No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Love her? MOORE: No. Not going to happen. Cory, love him. No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I wouldn't -- MOORE: No. It's not -- no, we cannot run a politician against him. We will lose. We have to run a beloved American. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, patriot. MOORE: We have to run beloved -- Obama became beloved the night of that convention and he was beloved from that moment on. (CROSSTALK) MOORE: And we need to run somebody -- (CROSSTALK) MOORE: -- whether -- it's got to be like a Michelle Obama or it's got to Sully Sullenberger. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: And with Democrats said to take control of the house, former speaker Newt Gingrich is warning about what can happen if they only focus on investigating President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NEWT GINGRICH: If all you do is end up in investigations which unfortunately we did it '98, it actually hurts you because the country wants to see things work. I mean, the country doesn't want to have the house Democrats spend all day, every day, in investigations and in open warfare against the president. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: So, Jesse, I think that what Michael Moore is saying, you need someone with a large celebrity quotient. You know how Trump had The Apprentice and all that and the book, so what do you think? WATTERS: I agree with Michael Moore. I can't believe I'm saying that. \u00a0But he does have good political instincts. He predicted the rise of Trump. \u00a0I would not nominate the left-wing senators from the coast. They have no charisma nationally. They have no fund-raising apparatus, no policy chops. \u00a0And they're not likable people. Donald Trump, what he does with opponents is he makes them look weak. Because he's, number one, hilarious, and number two, he's so outside the box with a sharp tongue and attacks that his opponents get offended very easily. So when land blows they get offended. And they're always getting offended. And that just looks lame and it looks pathetic and it looks weak. So what they need to do, and I kind of agree with Moore here, they need to nominate someone like Alec Baldwin and here's why. He's handsome, Hollywood guy, and he doesn't care about anything. He will hit Trump back twice as hard and he has the ability to laugh Trump off. What a lot of people don't understand about Trump, you kind of have to blow him off and laugh him off. PERINO: Yeah. WATTERS: And if you don't have to get in the dirt, you don't have to get in the dirt. Just laugh him off or hit them right between the eyes again. \u00a0But he's the only one that's authentic enough to punch back because he actually, literally, does punch back. And I think he could -- you know, he's also a little bit serious. You know, he likes policy and he loves the country. I'm saying Alec for president 2020. WILLIAMS: So, Dagen -- MCDOWELL: You've just gave them a playbook. WILLIAMS: This is very interesting -- you know, I never thought about Baldwin is all that handsome, but Jesse assures me. GUTFELD: Oh, he's gorgeous. WILLIAMS: He's gorgeous. MCDOWELL: He's hot -- hot-rod. WILLIAMS: OK. So what about Joe Biden? Is he a hot-rod? MCDOWELL: Joe Biden has always -- no, Joe Biden is not hot-rod. But Joe Biden has problems if you talk to anybody -- who are Democratic fund- raisers, with raising money. And that was one of the things -- he was exploring potentially taking on Hillary Clinton for the nomination. He met with some donors and he's just has trouble and -- how many times has he run for the presidency anyway? I mean, how many shots is Joe Biden going to get? But I can't wait -- what's going to happen is you're going to be what, two, three dozen people on the debate stage all trying to out-left the next one as they're going to push each other so far to the left it's going to make it really hard for whoever wins the Democratic nomination to run against Trump, because it's not going to be Medicare for all, Juan. It's going to be -- health care. We want the government running our hospitals and paying our doctors. And that's not going to fly with the American people. WILLIAMS: Dana? PERINO: I think Michael Moore is trying to give them really good advice and they will not take it, all right. So he knows that rust belt part of the country very well. That is key to President Trump reelection strategy. \u00a0He only won those states by a slim margin, 78,000 votes or whatever, between Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. He's got to re -- he's got to figure out how to do that again or he's got to find Electoral College votes elsewhere. And he's not really expanding his appeal, right? He's got his base and his Republican Party locked down. So, Michael Moore is saying we've got to find somebody who can appeal to those people in the rust belt. He's not necessarily saying that you need a moderate. I understand what he's saying. He needs somebody beloved. It's like a figure that everybody -- a person everybody knows, a hero to the Democratic Party. But I think he's also saying don't go too far left. And Gingrich is also giving them very good advice. And he's saying take it for me, I screwed up. We screwed up and we did too many investigations and it hurt us going forward. WILLIAMS: By the way, Biden, what do you thing? I mean, the Democrats, right now, that's their number-one pick. PERINO: I think -- if I were Biden's people, I would not want to be considered the No. 1 pick right now. WATTERS: Sounds like Juan likes Biden. WILLIAMS: No, I'm just telling you, it's clear -- PERINO: You want to be the No. 1 pick in 18 months. WILLIAMS: It's like, Biden is like 30-something percent. And the next highest is in the low teens. PERINO: You don't want to be the one at the top. That's when everyone's taking swings at you. You want to be, like, sort of mid right now. WILLIAMS: What about this, Greg? You heard Michael Moore mention Michelle Obama, Sully Sullenberger. He didn't mention Oprah. GUTFELD: No. WILLIAMS: And then Dagen mentioned your favorite, right? But what about Michael Avenatti? GUTFELD: The litigating lollipop. He's got all fire and fury, but he has no resume; and he will be in jail soon. You know what Moore was waiting for? The chorus of them to say -- PERINO: \"You!\" GUTFELD: -- \"you. Please run. Please run, or at least waddle.\" PERINO: \"You're describing yourself.\" GUTFELD: \"You're describing yourself.\" And you know what? He is. The antithesis of Trump really is Michael Moore. Boisterous. I mean, he truly does look a little like Large Marge from \"Pee-Wee's.\" But he does have the same -- he's a fighter. He knows how -- he knows how to get the base going with his movies. But just remember, they have -- the Dems will have an advantage with the media, because this next 2020, 2020 is going to be about good versus evil: the battle against evil monster Trump. So whoever they ever get, it's going to be David versus Goliath; it's going to be Gandhi versus Hitler. \u00a0Whoever they pick, the media is just going to get behind that person; and it's going to be way easy to go up against Trump. Trump's got a lot to -- MCDOWELL: I'm looking forward to watching these Democratic candidates throw shade at each other. GUTFELD: Yes. MCDOWELL: Like, Hillary Clinton accused Bernie Sanders of being a sexist, quietly -- GUTFELD: Yes. MCDOWELL: -- because she talks loudly. And she made that about being a woman. But who's going to call out Elizabeth Warren for letting Harvard Law -- GUTFELD: Right. MCDOWELL: -- refer to her as the first woman of color? GUTFELD: Kamala will. Who's going to -- who's going to share the debate questions? WILLIAMS: Well, I think Republicans did a pretty good job of throwing shade, but guess what? Donald Trump is president. GUTFELD: He threw the most. MCDOWELL: He won. Only one. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: Chris Christie had the most shade. But Trump threw the most. WILLIAMS: Oh, stop. You're being mean. You're fat shaming today. Coming up -- coming up, angry protesters target our very own Tucker Carlson outside of his home. The details up next on \"The Five.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MCDOWELL: A radical left-wing mob targeting our own Tucker Carlson. An angry group of criminal Antifa protesters showed up outside his home last night, the crowd chanting threats against him and his family. They vandalized his property. Tucker wasn't home at the time, but his wife was. When the group started banging on his front door, she hid in the pantry, called 911, thinking that she was about to be a victim of a home invasion. \u00a0D.C. Police are now investigating the incident as a hate crime. Dana, there are a lot more details in this. Apparently, there was one protester caught mentioning a pipe bomb among other details, and the front door being broken. PERINO: Having known, a lot of us -- all of us know Tucker and Susie, who is one of the most wonderful women. To imagine in your mind's eye what it was like for her, how scary that might have been; and to hide in your home and to not know what was happening. And I understand that his brother was there pretty quickly. These people are such cowards. It is -- it's distressing. And I know that if it was the other way around, that somebody on the left that had a talk show had this happen to them at their House, Tucker Carlson would be the first to defend them and defend them strongly. And hopefully, other people well. I do want to mention that FOX News, the CEO, Suzanne Scott, and the president, Jay Wallace, put out a statement saying how reprehensible it was. And that \"We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of view and that recent events across our country clearly highlight the need for a more civil, respectful and inclusive national conversation.\" \u00a0And they say also that \"Those of us in the media and in politics bear a special obligation to all Americans to find common ground.\" That was their statement today. MCDOWELL: How do you put a stop to it, though? GUTFELD: Well, I think it was Kilmeade, because his book got knocked off by -- You know, here's the thing. You can't tell your followers to confront people and get in their faces. I am glad that other talk show hosts actually have come out and said this is bad. But I do think -- I do think one way to tamp down all of this is for everybody to put politics back in the box where it belongs. We have let -- we are letting people dictate where politics can go. To restaurants, to entertainment, movies, television. The one thing is I can say that Juan and I can agree: politics is not part of your family. It's not part of this. But the people in the street that were at Tucker's House, they're never going to listen to us, because they don't have a life. Their life is this. \u00a0Their life is antagonism. So we can say we've got to tamp this down and be calm, but it's going to fall on deaf ears, sadly. WILLIAMS: I think a lot of it is a rage. And so people get incited and they decide they're going to take it in their own hands. And so even though we may be having a legitimate argument or debate here on FOX or any cable station, I think there are people who then get over the -- over themselves, you know, overly excited and then become threatening and think it's legitimate to go to someone's House. Well, how illegitimate. How ineffective. In fact, it has the contrary effect. I think it gives people who support whatever you don't like about what Tucker is saying, it gives them ammunition then to redouble and to feel some moral superiority to you as the protester. And I think it's so key that other people in our business have rallied to Tucker's side. And remember: not everybody agrees with Tucker. But here, keep this in mind. Don Lemon, somebody was arrested, an Arkansas man, for dozens of threats against Don Lemon. Don Lemon and Tucker Carlson couldn't be more opposite on issues like diversity and immigration, but what do you see? Now they have something in common, which is common indecency of people threatening you, because you're on television making a statement. By the way, I get this. I'll tell you, I don't like death threats, and I've seen them from both sides. I don't like it. I don't like being trolled. I don't like being attacked. My books, my writing, I can't stand it. MCDOWELL: But this -- WILLIAMS: But I just think this is where we have gone as a country. And this moment with Tucker is a moment that we need to seriously absorb and know that this is the time to stop, especially before we get into the 2020 cycle. WATTERS: Well, Hillary said the resistance would stop being so uncivil once they won the House. I guess these people never got that memo. There's two things going on here. One, the state of activism in America today. There's no huge civil rights struggle. There's no draft. There's nothing that threatening going on in American society. The economy is humming. So the people that have that resistance in their blood, those people that are born to march the streets, what are they marching for? \u00a0What are they marching against? They really don't have anything. GUTFELD: Against a talk show host. MCDOWELL: Think about it. We love Tucker. Very talented guy. He is a talk show host on cable. He is not the leader of a mass armed resistance that's taking away everybody's rights. So let's just put it in perspective. The other thing going on here is this. When you're surrounding someone's homes, you've lost the intellectual argument. Tucker Carlson makes pretty well-thought-out intellectual arguments about immigration, about tearing down monuments, about trade, political correctness. And he does it in a very thoughtful way. The people that disagree with him can't make that intellectual arguments, so what they do, they're reduced to surrounding his house and chanting. \u00a0And that is so uncivilized in this country. We don't live in the dark ages where you rush a house with a pitchfork. These people should man up, stop being such infantile -- PERINO: They should be arrested, too. WATTERS: -- people. And actually, if you disagree with someone, there's avenues and institutions in this country where you could get heard. MCDOWELL: Dana made the point: you arrest them, you charge them and you throw them in prison, period. By the way, Kilmeade, he's hosting \"Carlson\" tonight. GUTFELD: I know, I know. MCDOWELL: But Tucker -- GUTFELD: Do you think that was a coincidence? MCDOWELL: Tucker -- to be clear, to be clear, Tucker had a scheduled evening off. GUTFELD: Yes. MCDOWELL: He's going to be calling in, so I've been told. GUTFELD: Excellent. MCDOWELL: So you must tune in. Up next, it's \"Wild Card Wednesday,\" on Thursday. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: Dagen likes the country music. Thank you, Dagen, for dancing there. Welcome back. It's been a busy week, so we move to \"Wild Card Wednesday\" today, Thursday. GRAPHIC: Wild Card Wednesday (MUSIC) PERINO: There it is. GUTFELD: Yes, look at that. PERINO: So we each take a topic and put them in this hat. None of us know the stories each other picked. So I get to pull them out of a hat. I haven't even cheated this time. GUTFELD: Good for you, Dana. PERINO: So I don't know what it is. Let's see. Coffee stores implement 16-year-age restriction for buying caffeinated drinks. WILLIAMS: That was mine. PERINO: It's yours. Why do you think that's a good idea? WILLIAMS: I didn't think they -- they didn't impose it. What happened was that they denied a 12-year-old girl a cup of coffee. Her dad then said, \"What is it about? Why can't my daughter get --?\" And they said, \"We don't serve people under 16.\" So to my mind, that was, like, hmm. That's really interesting. In this country -- that, by the way, this took place in England. PERINO: Yes, of course. WILLIAMS: And -- but in this country, we say you can't have cigarettes or alcohol. WATTERS: Well, that's different, Juan. I want kids hopped up on coffee. \u00a0They do their chores much faster. Seriously. WILLIAMS: Is that right? WATTERS: Yes. WILLIAMS: Cheaper labor. WATTERS: And they get real wound up and then they go to bed. GUTFELD: But the first -- then they start having coffee, and then \"I'm going to have a cigarette.\" It's a coffee and cigarette break. They're out in front of the house. PERINO: Yes, it's all about liberty for coffee. WATTERS: It's a gateway drug. GUTFELD: They're out in front of the house for their work -- their lunch break. MCDOWELL: I can -- just as a warning to teenagers and adults alike that, if you drink too much coffee, you can easily develop a facial twitch. WATTERS: Really? MCDOWELL: Which happened to me when I first started working here. GUTFELD: No way. MCDOWELL: I was drinking so much coffee. and I was doing this on the air. GUTFELD: I thought you were flirting with me. WILLIAMS: But the other thing is, they don't let them have energy drinks. PERINO: Well, I know. GUTFELD: Communists. WILLIAMS: Communists. PERINO: Well, it is the U.K. There are a lot of rules there. That's why I had to leave. OK, next one is, woman finds basic engagement ring before boyfriend proposes, and she complained about it online. She called it \"basic A.F.\" \u00a0And Comfortably Smug (ph) one time had to tell me what \"A.F.\" meant. She's -- but she's got blowback, because she's complaining. And people online are saying -- GUTFELD: How much was the ring? WATTERS: I'm going to side with her. That ring -- that ring is just tiny. \u00a0That's like a chip. You can see it. GUTFELD: Yes, but -- but maybe that's all he can afford. She shouldn't, like -- WATTERS: Save up, bro. MCDOWELL: She actually said -- posted online not only the photo. This is my story. GUTFELD: What a mistake. MCDOWELL: That \"Tell me how to tactfully say no, you need to go get something different.\" I'm probably the only person at this table who has actually sold my divorced husband's -- my engagement ring on eBay. GUTFELD: Wow. MCDOWELL: So I will say this. This dude is doing it right. The only way to make this ring better is if it's not even diamonds. If it was, like, cubic zirconia. This is the worst investment ever. GUTFELD: Exactly. Save up for a home. MCDOWELL: You get -- listen, if you get divorced, guess who gets to keep the ring? The dude doesn't. GUTFELD: Yes. MCDOWELL: The woman gets to keep it. It's a contractual gift to the woman. You never, ever -- GUTFELD: This is advice. WILLIAMS: Don't -- MCDOWELL: You know what? Lie and say it's real diamonds. She will never go check. And if she goes and checks, then don't even marry her. WATTERS: Wow. WILLIAMS: I think what happened to you in the selling is likely to happen to this couple. Because if she's checking and complaining at this point, this ain't going nowhere. WATTERS: That's right. PERINO: Let me go to another one. College students save space to destress from midterm election results. Come on, kids. The university noted the transition of power and the rapid speed of change may cause stress and anxiety about the political environment and the future of our nation. This is your point. Is this your story? GUTFELD: No, it wasn't. But I'll tell you what: I'm on their side on this, in that we are living longer. So like, you know, 50 is the new 40. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: So 18 is the new 8. WATTERS: I'm changing my position on this. I used to make fun of these millennials for needing these little timeouts. Now I'm thinking if I was in college, and I got, like, a little safe space to chill and have no classes, I'd be like, \"Yes, this midterm is stressing me out. I need to skip it.\" I'm all for it. MCDOWELL: Well, we have -- WILLIAMS: That was an argument for it? I think that was an argument for your -- WATTERS: Put yourself in their shoes, Juan. WILLIAMS: No, that was an argument -- WATTERS: You're going to do anything you can to get out of class in college. WILLIAMS: Hey, Jesse -- I can hear Jesse -- WATTERS: If you're a little upset about the midterms, I'll take it. WILLIAMS: No. Normally, you talk about your mom, but I think your dad, I'm going to speak for your dad right now. \"I'm paying for you to go to school, not to have chill-out sessions.\" All right? WATTERS: That is true. PERINO: Yes, and that's -- all right. A 69-year-old dutchman starts a legal bid to become 20 years younger. Greg, why did you choose this? GUTFELD: Because I predicted this. When you can start changing your gender -- PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: -- or who you see yourself. Rachel Dolezal. PERINO: I could change my height. GUTFELD: Changed her race, right? Change your height. You can say -- I can say that there are people who are actually identifying as animals now. PERINO: Oh, jeez. GUTFELD: No, you can look it up. And so -- you can't argue with them, because \"It's my identity.\" So he's identifying as a person 20 years younger. WATTERS: See, that's financially stupid, because you get discounts at movies. You get discounts on public transportation. GUTFELD: And you don't get -- WATTERS: Take advantage of that. GUTFELD: And your Social Security is 20 years away now. PERINO: But he said he wanted to do it to improve his chances with women on dating apps and help with job prospects. GUTFELD: To lie. WATTERS: Just lie. PERINO: And discrimination against older people at the workplace is a problem. GUTFELD: Oh, you're defending this? WATTERS: I've noticed I've been discriminated against once I hit 40. It's true. I'm not getting the same opportunities I got in my 30s. MCDOWELL: But then you -- but then you got the hairpiece and everything. WATTERS: I told you that in confidence. PERINO: Jesse, we could send you back out on the road. And we could -- you want those opportunities? WATTERS: Yes, \"Watters' World\" gets back out there. Did someone say spring break? PERINO: Yes, so OK. And we don't get to talk about it, but mine was about a 7-foot alligator. \u00a0Do we have time? OK, so the owner of a 7-foot alligator is upset because animal control officers came and took him away. And he said, \"No, he's like a dog.\" GUTFELD: That's a crock. WATTERS: Oh, good one! PERINO: But guess what? WATTERS: It's a therapy support alligator. PERINO: But guess what? They also found two boa constrictors and a rabbit. But I'm thinking that the rabbit was -- WATTERS: That was launch. PERINO: Yes, exactly, for the boa constrictors. WILLIAMS: Yes, and you know what struck me about that story: the alligator was in a hot tub. GUTFELD: Oh, God. WILLIAMS: He must have been having a great time. GUTFELD: Don't ever do that, trust me. WATTERS: Was this Florida? In Florida? PERINO: Kansas City. GUTFELD: Weekend in Mexico, I'll never forget it. MCDOWELL: Being a redneck, I can tell you, alligators prefer chickens over rabbits. And the rabbit was in the other room. It wasn't near the animals that would eat it. That's why it's still alive. PERINO: I mean, just rescue a dog. Great. \"One More Thing\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Time for \"One More Thing.\" I get to go first. Hooray. Let's do this. GRAPHIC: Greg's Robot News GUTFELD: \"Greg's Robot News.\" All right, man. There's some good news and bad news. The National Institute of Industrial Science and Technology has created a humanoid robot that can do construction. So it seems like construction workers are now under threat. This is a constructor who's actually installing drywall by itself. PERINO: Really moving slow. GUTFELD: So the negative side to this, Dana. WATTERS: It takes 20 years to get the house built. GUTFELD: I know. It takes forever. The down side is it could replace jobs, but the upside: no plumber's crack. WATTERS: Oh, God. GUTFELD: All right. Dana. PERINO: That really is an upside. GUTFELD: It's an upside, believe me. PERINO: And I was worried about that. GUTFELD: I've seen enough of it. PERINO: So I want to see if anything here will feel like they're unambitious or lazy when I tell you this story. Thirty-one-year-old Pete Kostelnik just finished his 5,400-mile Ke2Key run. \u00a0Pete is an ultra-marathon runner. He started his journey on July 31 in Anchor Point on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. He finishes Monday in Florida's Key West. He averaged 55 miles a day for 97 days, kept all of his supplies in that stroller there. There's no baby in there. He says that he hopes his feet would inspire others to chase their dreams, as well. And in 2016, Pete ran 3,067 miles from San Francisco to New York City. So he's running a lot. GUTFELD: Doesn't he know there's Amtrak? WILLIAMS: That would make sense. GUTFELD: Juan. WILLIAMS: All right. So get-well wishes tonight for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The 85-year-old fell at the court yesterday. She fractured three ribs. After a night at home, she's been admitted to George Washington Hospital for observation. You know she's the oldest member of the high court. Her current illness is the latest in a long line. She's been through two bouts of cancer and had a heart stent implanted. Ginsburg keeps going, though. She hasn't missed a day of oral arguments and selected clerks to work with her through 2020. Of course, political speculation about her health, will Donald Trump have a third nomination to the court? I say let's leave politics aside and just say get well to the Notorious RBG. MCDOWELL: I'm going to get you a \"Keep Planking, RBG\" T-shirt, because she's notorious for her yoga workouts. So there you go. That will be your Christmas gift. WILLIAMS: Thank you. GUTFELD: Jesse. WATTERS: All right. I'm going to do my Juan imitation. If you thought your commute was bad, check this video out. Here's a wild boar attacking a Japanese man during his morning commute. The guy was walking to the local train station when all of a sudden, wham! \u00a0A wild boar takes him out at the knees and then goes after his briefcase. \u00a0The pig also bit the guy and bored him with his tusks. Southern island of Kyushu Fuku (ph). It turns out the train station is about half a mile from a mountainous area. Authorities think the boar accidentally ran through the town. The man was hospitalized, needing a total of 13 stitches. WILLIAMS: Oh, my God. It's good. WATTERS: -- along -- on his left thigh. WILLIAMS: I think your imitation of me is better than the story. WATTERS: This story is not boar-ing. WILLIAMS: That's good. WATTERS: You like that? WILLIAMS: I like that. I can't get over it. GUTFELD: That's probably your best \"One More Thing\" ever. WILLIAMS: That was great. PERINO: Please keep that for the Christmas show. GUTFELD: Dana. MCDOWELL: Thank you for teeing up my \"One More Thing.\" Christmas sweaters, Miller Lite. It's a perfect combination. They released their ugly sweater for the 2018 holidays. PERINO: Greg, you need that. GUTFELD: I do. MCDOWELL: And then you can also get socks or a hat with a little pom-pom. PERINO: It's not that ugly. MCDOWELL: The dress socks are less than -- GUTFELD: No, I've seen worse. I have worse. PERINO: That one's pretty ugly. MCDOWELL: But I need a chin strap on the hat to carry my beer. GUTFELD: This person never wears an ugly Christmas sweater. It's \"Special Report\" up next, Bret Baier. Hey, Bret. How's it going. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS: I have a couple of them. Thanks, Greg. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "Republican Bob Hugin calls his Democratic opponent Sen. Bob Menendez 'corrupt,' says New Jersey voters deserve better. In 1973, I took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution when I joined the U.S. Marine Corps. When Bob Menendez was elected to Congress 25 years ago, he took an oath to serve the people of New Jersey. I upheld my oath. Bob Menendez violated his. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running to replace him in the United States Senate. Instead of having a senator fighting for the good, hard-working people of our state, we have been disgraced by a senator who was indicted by President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department for taking nearly $1 million in illegal gifts and campaign contributions in exchange for official actions. That was the very same Obama Justice Department that had specific, corroborated evidence to back up allegations that Bob Menendez participated in morally reprehensible behavior. Menendez was publicly admonished earlier this year by his own colleagues \u2013 Republicans and his fellow Democrats \u2013 for violating federal law and abusing the power of his office by lobbying for his \u201cbest friend,\u201d a donor from Florida who was convicted of 67 felonies and imprisoned for blinding his patients and stealing $73 million from Medicare. My entire life has been about bringing people together and producing results. I\u2019m an action-oriented, results-driven leader. Is Bob Menendez really the best person we can send to Washington, D.C. to represent New Jersey? Is he the type of role model we want for our children? Of course not. New Jersey deserves better. Bob Menendez has represented us in Washington for 25 years \u2013 16 of those years with a Democratic president \u2013 and yet has delivered very little for our state. Our economy continues to struggle despite a strong national economy. We continue to be dead last \u2013 50 out of 50 \u2013 in what our state gets in return from Washington for the taxes we send to the federal government. Our residents face tax hikes again and again. And we are consistently ranked as the worst state for property taxes and affordability. New Jersey this year was again ranked as having the worst business tax environment by the Tax Foundation. And New Jersey is ranked No. 1 for the rate at which millennials are leaving our state. My wife Kathy and I love New Jersey and we wouldn\u2019t have raised our three children anywhere else. My daughter has a successful career as a marketing manager and my two sons are serving our country in the U.S. Marine Corps. We want them and all future New Jerseyans to be able to build a life, work and retire in New Jersey. But we must do better. New Jersey must hold our elected leaders accountable. My entire life has been about bringing people together and producing results. I\u2019m an action-oriented, results-driven leader. I grew up in a diverse, hard-working neighborhood in Union City, NJ, and was fortunate to receive a full scholarship to Princeton. I felt so fortunate for that opportunity that I wanted to give back \u2013 to do something larger than myself. After graduating from college, I served seven years on active duty in the Marine Corps and served seven additional years in the Reserves. I learned selfless leadership, honor, and integrity \u2013 characteristics that all of our elected officials should have. I also learned that leaders go where the problems are and that to accomplish a mission, you must work as a team. I carried those lessons into the private sector, spending the past 30 years building companies and creating jobs. For the last two decades, I worked in the nation's dynamic health care sector, both as the leader of the biotech company Celgene, and as a board member for one of the country's most forward-looking health-care systems, Atlantic Health System located in New Jersey. When I first joined Celgene, the company had just six weeks of cash remaining and an uncertain future. Today, Celgene is known around the world for being a leader in the fight against cancer. Recently, Forbes named it the No. 9 company overall on its World's Best Employers 2018 list, and the No. 1 health care company on the list. I know I can make a difference in the U.S. Senate because for my entire life I have worked with others to deliver results. This election is a chance to take our state in a new direction and give New Jersey a fresh, independent voice in Washington. For too long, career politicians in Washington have put their own partisan self-interests above the people they are supposed to be serving, and Bob Menendez represents the very worst of today\u2019s partisan politics. It\u2019s time for change. It\u2019s time to send in a Marine.",

            "article_content": "Kadina Group President Gary B. Smith and Stock Swoosh Owner Melissa Armo discuss Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-Calif.) comments against the U.S. economy. A Democratic congressman from New York state torched Nancy Pelosi this week, calling her \"aloof, frenetic and misguided,\" as he joined a growing group of rebel Democrats who say they won\u2019t back the Californian for another term as the party's leader in the House. U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, from the Buffalo area, told the Buffalo News\u00a0that Pelosi has shown a lack of leadership and failed to produce an alternative to President Trump's agenda, such as pursuing a Medicare expansion or an investment in infrastructure. \"I will not support her,\" Higgins said in the interview. \"She's listening, but this is my conclusion: She's aloof, frenetic and misguided. U.S. House Rep. Brian Higgins is calling for a change in Democratic Party's leadership. (Facebook) \"I'm giving voice to a frustration that I hear every single day,\" he added, referring to other House Democrats. \"I don't want to call anybody out. But this is the conversation that is taking place.\" Pelosi responded to Higgins' criticism, saying his concerns were largely based on their disagreement regarding his bill that would expand Medicare to people aged 50 to 64. The New Yorker's comments about Pelosi came as multiple prospective candidates and sitting members of Congress expressed concerns about their 78-year-old leader, who was House speaker for four years before becoming minority leader in 2011. DEMOCRATIC HOUSE HOPEFUL PUTS OUT AD SAYING HE \u2018WON\u2019T VOTE FOR NANCY PELOSI\u2019 AMID GOP ATTACKS Clarke Tucker, a Democrat running for a congressional seat held by Republicans in Arkansas, released a new ad this week in which he distanced himself from Pelosi, saying he won\u2019t back her if elected. The video follows relentless GOP attacks trying to link him with Pelosi. \"[Republican Congressman French Hill] opened his campaign by attacking me, knowing full well that I've said from day one that I won't vote for Nancy Pelosi. We're better than that,\" Tucker says in the ad. U.S. House Rep. Conor Lamb from Pennsylvania, who won a special election in March in a historically GOP district that Trump had won by nearly 20 points, also said he won\u2019t vote for Pelosi and campaigned as a moderate Democrat. Higgins remains particularly concerned about the party\u2019s ability to come up with policies that could persuade the traditional Democratic voters, who supported Trump in 2016, to come back to the Democratic Party. \"Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on, not only in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan but in Cheektowaga, West Seneca, Hamburg, Orchard Park and Lancaster,\" he told the newspaper, mentioning the states and municipalities Trump won in the presidential election. He adds that the party needs a clearer vision, a stronger leader and offer more than just opposition to the White House if the party wants to retake the control after the midterm elections. \u201cWhen she's on the floor, she's all over the place; she's frenetic. I think she lacks gravitas.\u201d \"The only thing I have is a voice and a vote, and I have to use that to try to get my conference to recognize that resistance to Trump at best is only half of it,\" he said. \"We have to offer something affirmative.\" Speaking of 2020, the Democrat remained skeptical. \"We are not ready for 2020. We're lacking a clear, coherent and compelling narrative,\u201d he said. One reason why the party isn\u2019t yet ready to challenge Trump, according to Higgins, is the leader of the House. \u201cWhen she's on the floor, she's all over the place; she's frenetic,\u201d he said of Pelosi. \u201cI think she lacks gravitas.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Connecticut gubernatorial candidate, Tim Herbst, calls for the city official to resign. Hotly contested gubernatorial primary races across the country could make history on Tuesday, as Republicans hope to continue to erode Democratic control of New England governorships and progressives look to nominate the nation's first-ever transgender candidate to a state's highest office. In deep-blue Connecticut, which went for Hillary Clinton by double-digits in the 2016 presidential campaign,\u00a0Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim and wealthy businessman Ned Lamont are competing for the Democratic nomination to succeed deeply unpopular\u00a0Gov. Dan Malloy. Malloy, who decided not to seek a third term, was shown by some polls to be\u00a0the least popular governor\u00a0in the nation, with critics citing the\u00a0state's high taxes\u00a0and major budget woes. That's left an opening for Republicans, who are looking to continue to encroach on governorships in the traditionally liberal New England. The GOP currently holds the governorships of four out of six states in the region, including Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Connecticut Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy, who is not running for re-election, is deeply unpopular in the liberal state. (AP, File) New England, long a liberal stronghold, has been home to something of a Republican insurgence in recent years, with GOP candidates\u00a0attributing their success\u00a0to a healthy mixture of fiscal conservatism, socially moderate views and a willingness to collaborate with political rivals. TUESDAY'S BIG PRIMARY: WILL THE #METOO MOVEMENT HAVE A ROLE? Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, former First Selectman Tim Herbst, businessman Steve Obsitnik, former investment banker Bob Stefanowski and former hedge fund manager David Stemerman are the candidates for the GOP nomination in Connecticut's governor race, and they've also cited an additional factor: widespread unhappiness with state Democratic leadership. \"There is definitely frustration, and I think that\u2019s why you sort of see that red tide, a mini red tide if you will, out in this part of the state in terms of seats flipping from blue to red,\u201d Boughton, the GOP\u2019s endorsed candidate, told The Associated Press. However, the Republican candidates have disagreed on what to do with the state's income tax. Stefanowski and Boughton have said they want to eliminate it entirely, while Stemerman and Obsitnik have balked at the idea. Meanwhile, in Vermont,\u00a0Republican Gov. Phil Scott is running for re-election \u2013 and is\u00a0favored to win it. No sitting governor has been defeated in Vermont since 1962,\u00a0but Democrats have two candidates running who could make history, and some Republicans remain upset about Scott's decision to sign gun-control legislation into law earlier this year. WATCH: PROTESTERS HECKLE 'TRAITOR' VERMONT GOVERNOR FOR SIGNING ANTI-GUN LAW Christine Hallquist faces long odds in Tuesday's primary in Vermont. (AP, File) Christine Hallquist\u00a0is vying to be the first openly transgender woman to serve as a U.S. governor. A former CEO of the Vermont Electric Cooperative, Hallquist is focused on tackling climate change and implementing universal health care in the Green Mountain State. \"Nationally, I want to be known as the first trans candidate.\" She's appealed to Vermonters with a progressive message including a livable wage, Medicare for all, free public college education and high-speed broadband access \u2014 even to those who live on remote back roads. \"That's how I want to be known in Vermont,\" Hallquist, 62, told The Associated Press in an interview at her Burlington offices. \"Nationally, I want to be known as the first trans candidate.\" Another Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Vermont is hoping to make history on Monday, as well: a 14-year-old boy who took advantage of the state constitution's lack of an age requirement to hold office. This undated photo provided by the Ethan 2018 Campaign shows Ethan Sonneborn, of Bristol, Vt., who is one of the four Vermont Democrats seeking the party nomination to run for governor (Ethan 2018 Campaign) The boy, Ethan Sonneborn, has hit the ground running, attending debates and insisting he could lead the state. \"I think Vermonters should take me seriously because I have practical progressive ideas, and I happen to be 14, not the other way around,\" Sonneborn said in a recent televised gubernatorial forum. \"I think that my message and my platform transcend age.\" In April, Scott signed what for Vermont was historic \u2014 if mild by national standards \u2014 restrictions on gun ownership, angering his Republican base. His once sky-high popularity has waned, potentially leaving an opening for a well-funded Democratic challenger.\u00a0\u00a0Scott faces a primary challenge from Springfield businessman Keith Stern, who describes himself as a conservative running on financial issues. Meanwhile, Wisconsin and Minnesota are home to tight races with national significance. In Wisconsin, eight Democrats are running in the primary to take on incumbent Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican and former presidential candidate who faces only one challenger within his own party.\u00a0Trump\u00a0barely eked out a win\u00a0over Clinton in the 2016 presidential election in Wisconsin, earning 47.8 percent of the vote compared to her 47.0 percent. Walker has warned of a possible \"blue wave\" in November, saying \"the wind's not at our back.\" And in Minnesota,\u00a0Tim Pawlenty is hoping to stage a political comeback and become Minnesota\u2019s governor again, in a race that Fox News considers a tossup. Pawlenty is one of three candidates vying for the GOP nomination for governor to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton. His main opponent is Jeff Johnson, who was the party\u2019s 2014 gubernatorial nominee.\u00a0On the Democrats\u2019 side are: state Rep. Erin Murphy, Minnesota Attorney Gen. Lori Swanson and U.S. Rep. Tim Walz. Pawlenty said he retired from politics after he suspended his 2012 presidential campaign. He was first elected as Minnesota\u2019s governor in 2002 and was re-elected four years later. After he left the statehouse, he spent several years working for the Financial Services Roundtable in Washington, D.C Also in Minnesota, Rep. Keith Ellison\u2019s campaign for state attorney general\u00a0was thrown for a loop\u00a0after\u00a0an ex-girlfriend publicly alleged\u00a0he emotionally and physically abused her during the course of their relationship. Ellison was considered the heavy favorite leading up to the primary, given his fundraising advantage and leadership in the Democratic National Committee as its deputy chairman. He also got support from 2016 presidential contender and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Fox News' Kaitlyn Schallhorn contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Trump announces removal of federal ban on summer sales of gasoline with high-ethanol blends. President Trump accused Democrats of drifting into socialism and even looking to collapsing Venezuela as an economic model, in\u00a0a fiery Wednesday op-ed blasting the party's\u00a0\u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan. The\u00a0USA Today\u00a0column marked a rare\u00a0presidential appearance on the op-ed pages, and one aimed at portraying Democrats as increasingly \"radical\" -- an appeal to stave off a Democratic takeover of one or both chambers of Congress in November's midterms. \u201cThe truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThe new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America\u2019s economy after Venezuela.\u201d He added: \u201cIf Democrats win control of Congress in November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America. Government-run health care is just the beginning.\u201d In terms of policy, Trump vowed to \u201cprotect Medicare\u201d and tore into the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan\u2014a Democratic proposal backed by a growing number of liberal lawmakers including Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as well as New York House candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 'If Democrats win control of Congress in November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America.' Under the plan by Sanders, all Americans would gain access to government insurance with no copays or deductibles for medical services. The insurance industry would be regulated to play a minor role in the system. Supporters argue that other developed countries already have implemented systems like this, and America's private insurance-centered model continues to leave some families with crushing costs. But Republicans contend that the proposal would cost too much for taxpayers and argue it marks an extreme government overreach.\u00a0 According to recent studies, the program would increase government health spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years. The spending hikes would allow the government to replace what employers and consumers currently pay for health care\u2014delivering significant savings on administration and drug costs, but increased demand for care that would drive up spending, according to a study released by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University over the summer. The study estimated that doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes would not fully cover the additional costs for the program. Trump claimed the plan could negatively impact seniors as well. \u201cWe have seen Democrats across the country united around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cBy eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors, and outlawing the ability of Americans to enroll in private and employer-based plans, the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of healthcare.\u201d Trump went on to slam the program as simply \u201cMedicare for None.\u201d He claimed\u00a0that Democrats would \u201celiminate Medicare Advantage plans\u201d for nearly 20 million seniors, and eliminate \u201cevery American\u2019s private and employer-based health plan.\u201d Trump went on to allege Democrats are pushing other programs that would lead America \u201ccloser\u201d to socialism\u2014like \u201cmassive government control of education, private-sector businesses, and other major sectors of the U.S. economy.\u201d He added,\u00a0\u201cThis radical agenda would destroy American prosperity.\u201d Despite Republican criticism, Sanders, who sponsored the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill in the Senate, has support from a host of Democratic lawmakers and potential presidential hopefuls. Sanders fired back at Trump's op-ed Wednesday, slamming the president's budget, and blasting him as a liar. \"Now the president, who has a very difficult time telling the truth about anything, is lying about the Medicare For All proposal that I introduced, which poll after poll shows has strong majority support among the American people,\" Sanders said in a statement, noting that his proposal \"would not cut benefits for seniors on Medicare,\" but instead \"expand benefits.\" \"Our current dysfunctional health care system is designed to make huge profits for insurance companies and drug companies, rather than provide quality care for every man, woman and child,\" Sanders said. \"The time is now for the United States to join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to every American as a right noot a privilege.\" The idea won rank-and-file support after Sanders ran on the idea in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. Looking to the 2020 election, Democrats are debating whether single-payer should be a \u201clitmus test\u201d for national candidates. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

This is a rush transcript from \"The Story,\" July 16, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: Breaking tonight, brand new reaction pouring in as we get a deeper look at what happened today in Helsinki. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, back in New York tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. As president, I will always put what is best for America and what is best for the American people. MACCALLUM: So, that remains the most important question to consider here, and all of what we has watched as the president boiled allies and then backed up Putin, will it make the world a safer place ultimately when all is said and done? But today, Democrats and Republicans alike were left wincing at times over what was clearly a non-confrontational approach. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): The Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs including election process. Could you name a single fact of that what definitively proved the collusion? TRUMP: So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. He offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people. I think that's an incredible offer. Great, thank you. PUTIN: I'd like to add something to this, after all, I was an intelligence officer myself, and I do know how dossiers are made up. TRUMP: The probe is a disaster for our country. I think it's kept us apart. It's kept us separated, there was no collusion at all. It's ridiculous, it's ridiculous what's going on with the probe. PUTIN: Mr. President, I'll give this ball to you, and now the ball is in your court. All the more that the United States will host to the World Cup in 2026. TRUMP: That's right, thank you very much. We do host it and we hope we do as good a job. That's very nice that will go to my son Barron, we have no question. In fact, Melania here you go. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: So, Trump supporters tonight remain split. Newt Gingrich, tweeting, \"President Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin. It is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected immediately. Then, others like Rand Paul came to the president's defense. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY., FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: I think we need to take a step back and ask ourselves, is it good to have a conversation with your adversaries? The worst part of the Cold War prior to the Cuban missile crisis, Kennedy had a direct line to Khrushchev. That's what I would see this meeting as is renewing engagement and renewing open lines of conversation. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, strategic advantage or disadvantage ultimately? Joining me now, General Jack Keane, Fox News senior strategic analysts, and chairman of the Institute for the Study of War. General, always good to have you with us. We all watched with great interest today and it was quite something. What was your takeaway? GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Well, first of all, I'm absolutely delighted they got together. It makes all the sense in the world for many -- for many reasons and given the major, major international global security issues that are really on the table between our two countries and our allies. So, that is absolutely a good thing that anybody that argues against that, I think is just dead wrong. Number two, Putin did what I expected him to do score, propaganda victory and lie his way through every single issue as the hypocrite that he -- that he truly is, and coated those issues in a way that's certainly favorable to Russia and what he is doing. But really, the stunner for me, and sadly to say, disappointment was in the president's two major mistakes I think he made. One is not to stand behind the intelligence community as everybody's been talking about when the hard evidence, Martha is there that Russia meddled in our election. There is no doubt about that. We have the goods on these guys. That's the reality of it, the president knows that. And to stand there on a world stage and appease Russia in favor, in disfavor to our intelligence community was the thing that shocked me. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Yes. Yes, let me stop you right there before you -- if I may. KEANE: Will he should a bit of hundred percent behind him. MACCALLUM: Before you, you get to the second point. Because I want to -- this is a tweet that the president sent afterwards. Because no doubt, he did an interview, then he got on the plane, all of this started to come back to him. And here is what he said when he got on the plane. \"As I said today, and many times before, 'I have GREAT -- all in caps, confidence in my intelligence people.' However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past as the world's two great nuclear power -- largest nuclear powers, we must get along.\" How could he have handled that moment differently, not the -- not that you can hit rewind here? KEANE: Well, he could have said that. MACCALLUM: Yes. KEANE: That would have been a lot better. And I think the other thing, one of the things we don't know, Martha, is there was a four hour plus summit where the arm-wrestling took place over these major issues and I expect some very direct and frank discussions took place away from cameras and public viewing, certainly, when you can do that. And I think some of that information will come out later. But I do think that one of the things -- in fairness to President Trump, this did happen on President Obama's watch. But he's, he's got -- he's responsible for 2018 and 2020. And he has to give notice to Putin that, \"Look it, if you meddle in these elections in 18 and 20, not only am I going to impose the harshest sanctions that I'm able to do, but I will terminate the relationship with you to the end of my presidency. I will have nothing to do with you.\" MACCALLUM: Yes. KEANE: That is what needed to be said, not necessarily on that podium today, but certainly to his face in the summit point of the meeting, the second issue that I have with the president is that he equated U.S. behavior with Russian malign behavior for the deterioration of the relationship between the United States and Russia. And that just is not true. It's not the fact that we haven't made mistakes, of course, we have. But it's really Russia's malign and aggressive behavior for many years now that is causing the international security problems that we and our European allies have. Putin has expanded territory in a way that no one has done in the Soviet Union since Stalin. And he's encroaching on East European neighbors' intimidation and coercion on a regular basis, and not to speak of the intervention in Georgia, Crimea, Ukraine, and now in Syria. And obviously, undermining democracies of all of his opponents to include the United States. That is aggressive malign behavior that's at his doorstep. And by no means, as the United States contributed to that level of deterioration in a relationship, that's just wrong. MACCALLUM: General Keane, thank you very much. Great to get your insight tonight. Good to see you as always. Thanks for being here. KEAN: Yes, good talking to you, Martha. MACCALLUM: You too, sir. All right. So, during today's press conference, President Trump answered the meddling question by turning to the FBI and the DNC as the general was just referring to watches. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Said are wondering why the FBI never took the server? Haven't they taken this server? Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? Where is the server? I want to know, where is the server and what is the server saying? With that being said, all I can do is ask the question, my people came to me, Dan Coates came to me and some others, they said they think its Russia. I have President Putin, he just said it's not Russia. I will say this, I don't see any reason why it would be. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Here now, California Democrat, Eric Swalwell, member of the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, good to have you here tonight. REP. ERIC SWALWELL, D-CALIF., HOUSE INTELLIGENCE SELECT COMMITTEE: Good evening, Martha. MACCALLUM: It was an interesting turn when he was asked about that. He went to the issue of these servers questioning the FBI investigation, and why and how they would have been able to reach any conclusions when they never had those servers in hand. SWALWELL: Well, Martha, first, there may have been an American flag on that stage. I did not see an American president, I saw two defenders of Russia and for the President to insult the FBI, and he knows that server was imaged. In our investigation, we found that was sufficient. The FBI does this all the time when cyber-attacks occur. They don't just take a server away from a business, a company, an organization if imaging will provide the same information. And so, it was just disgusting to see him use this what about is him, rather than confronting the person responsible for ordering that attack. MACCALLUM: You know, in terms of -- and we're going to play a sound bite in just a moment, as soon as we have it turned around. Chris Wallace was talking to Vladimir Putin, and he basically called him on the carpet for his involvement in meddling in our elections and one of the things that he said that was very interesting was basically, well, you know, it wasn't a state operation, this was not a Russian state operation. But then, he almost -- you know, sort of admitted involvement in it because he said that you know, these e-mails -- you know, we didn't make them up that they were hacked, and then, they showed a real -- a real bunch of e- mails and communication, they weren't made up. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PUTIN: Was it some rigging of facts? Was it some forgery of facts? That's the important thing that I'm trying to employ point that I'm trying to make. Was there's any false information planted? No, it wasn't. The information that I am aware of. There's nothing false about it. Every single grain of it is true. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: He's saying, you know, whatever was divulged between a Democrat e-mails, they were all things they actually wrote anyway. What do you make of all that? SWALWELL: Well, first, I have a lot of respect for Chris Wallace that shows the value of a free press, they are not the enemy of the American people. But two, those e-mails were private e-mails. Not intended for the public. And by putting them out there and weaponizing them, they turned us against each other. This could happen to the Republicans. And Democrats, I hope if it ever does that we stand with them United and say, we're not going to tolerate this, whichever country does it, whichever party is affected by it, that we will use unity as an antidote if this was to ever happen again. And let me just add, Martha, Democrats have offered to the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee a use truce saying that if e-mails are hacked this election, we won't use it against you, if you don't use it against us. And they won't take us up on that. And I don't know why, and I wish they would. MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean, it would be remarkable to see that play out. But given how dirty we know these campaigns get, it's almost impossible to believe that, that would actually be a deal that, that could be reached. But we have heard a lot about the fact that there is already very active campaigns to get involved in the 2018 election. But I think, one of the things that perhaps bothers the president so much. And I think, you know, not to psychoanalyze, but one of the reasons that perhaps he appears to hate to go there is because he doesn't want to give up any ground in terms of how he won the election. But at the same time, you can say there was no collusion and it didn't impact the outcome. But we do need to know what they're doing and what any other government out there is doing because they're not alone, the Russians, in terms of getting in the way of our elections and we simply won't stand for it. SWALWELL: That's right, you can separate collusion from this interference campaign, and say, we're never going to tolerate an adversary doing this. Martha, just weeks after the November election, I wrote legislation -- bipartisan legislation to have an independent commission, because I fear this was too charged for Congress that we would dig in and if Republicans heard Russia, they would just assume that we were trying to delegitimize the presidency. And so, I wanted just like we did after September 11, to have a commission of elders and statesmen equally appointed by the House and the Senate Republicans and Democrats. So that they could give the American people the awareness they need and recommend the forms that Congress must pass. We could still do that, the September 11th commission was not created on September12th, It was over a year later, but I think that's the best way we could address this. MACCALLUM: So, you know, in terms of Vladimir Putin's offer that he would open up -- you know, what I don't know, but he said, \"Come on over here, and you can -- you can do your investigation of the people who you indicted, and we would also like to have the reciprocal ability to do the same.\" The president seemed to think that, that was, you know, a pretty big development out of their discussion. What did you make of it? SWALWELL: Well, that's a very naive way to look at it. I don't think any victim of a burglary would invite the burglar over to create a new home security system and that's exactly what Vladimir Putin is trying to do. MACCALLUM: Eric Swalwell, thank you very much, congressman. Thanks for being here. SWALWELL: Yes, my pleasure. MACCALLUM: All right, still to come this evening, Vladimir Putin calling out an American businessman who he wants to interrogate. Just mentioning that. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PUTIN: For instance, we can bring up Mr. Browder in this particular case. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Boy, does he have his focus on Mr. Browder, and he is here next to respond along with former KGB agent Jack Barsky, on how dangerous this man can be. Plus a huge rebuke and a potential sign of what's to come in November as longtime California Senator Dianne Feinstein loses the support of her own party in California. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN DE LEON, D-CANDIDATE TO SENATE, CALIFORNIA: We have a lot of Democrats who want a stronger voice and someone who's not on the sidelines with rather someone who's on the front lines to contend with this president who seeks to do everything with his power to undermine our great state of California. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL BROWDER, MAGNITSKY JUSTICE CAMPAIGN: I always have to be careful, there's a lot of countries that I don't travel to because I know that the governments in those countries are weak and would potentially hand me over to do a favor for Vladimir Putin. Putin is a cold-blooded killer and Putin would love to get rid of me. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That was the man who calls himself Vladimir Putin's number one foreign enemy. Bill Browder has been a target of the Kremlin for years now. And today the President of Russia called him out in that news conference specifically by name when he was there with President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes, neither in Russia or the United States and yet the money escape the country. So we have a solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Joining me now is Bill Browder, head of the Magnitsky Global Justice Campaign and Jack Barsky, former KGB Spy and Author of Deep Undercover: My Life of Entangled Allegiances as a KGB Spy in America. Gentlemen, welcome. Great to have both of you today. Bill, welcome back to the show. It must have gone right through you when you heard Putin call you out by name today. BROWDER: I wasn't actually watching the press conference, but I noticed all of a sudden my phone started burning up with messages and I thought, what's going on here? I logged on and then I saw -- I saw the comments that he made. And for everybody else, it's a big surprise. For me, Vladimir Putin has been coming after me for a long time. As someone joked on Twitter, I've got a rent-free space in his brain because he spent so much time thinking about me and he's so mad at me because of the act. The Magnitsky Act is a piece of legislation which freezes assets and bans visas of people in his inner circle who's involved in killing my lawyer Sergey Magnitsky and doing other type of stuff. And so, in a certain way, I was actually pleased to see how much I've gotten under his skin because that means the Magnitsky Act really works. MACCALLUM: Yes. You know what, you're absolutely right. I mean, it's very clear. But basically, what you're suggesting today and Jack, let me get your thoughts on this. He suggested you know what we've been happy to have Mueller and his investigators come over here to Russia and interview these 12 individuals that they brought indictments against on Friday for spying on and hacking in the American elections but there's one little caveat attached. We want a reciprocal ability to come to the United States and to interview and interrogate Bill Browder and his associates. Jack, what do you make of that? JACK BARSKY, FORMER RUSSIAN KGB SPY: This is typical Putin nonsense. But before I go into this, I'm so delighted and surprised to be on with Mr. Browder because I followed him, I read his book and I'm fully supportive of what he's been trying to do, and it really -- he's right. He hit them -- he hit the Russian government, the oligarchs and Putin, where it counts. It is in the pocketbook and this is what they have been after to alleviate of some kind. And the whole idea of -- it's absolutely ridiculous to say well, bring him in, we help you investigate these evil people that may have done something wrong to you. I mean, if you believe that, you believe that the moon is made out of cheese. MACCALLUM: So Jack, let me stay with you for a moment. When you watch this play out, what did you think? What did you -- was the dynamic between President Trump and Vladimir Putin? There was a lot of criticism out of this that President Trump went way too soft on Vladimir Putin in this conference. BARSKY: I'm so sorry, I was close to crying. This -- I so would like for this president to be successful, but what happened today, what happened to the man who likes to fire everybody? What happened to Mr. Gorbachev, turn down that wall? He was just sweetness. And even if you think he's playing this, this doesn't work on any of the national scene. It was sad. MACCALLUM: Bill, what did you think? BROWDER: I don't think the summit should have happened in the first place. Vladimir Putin has been a global menace. He's been out there invading foreign countries, changing borders, shooting down passenger planes, cheating in the Olympics, meddling with the elections, sending military grade chemical weapons to the heart of England. This guy is a complete, absolute, total criminal and running a tiny little economy the size of the state of New York and he supposed to be on par with the most powerful man in the free world? That's just not how it is. And on top of that -- BARSKY: Let me interrupt for a second. MACCALLUM: Go ahead, Jack. BARSKY: He's got half the nuclear weapons on the planet and that's why we have to be careful dealing with him. MACCALLUM: Very good point. BROWDER: Of course. Of course. MACCALLUM: I just want to ask both of you before we run out of time. The comments about how -- when President Trump was in Russia -- excuse me -- as a businessman, he had no idea he was there. He said businessman come and go all the time. He said I couldn't even possibly name the 500 businessmen who were at that conference, and we certainly aren't wasting our time spying on them. I would love to get your reaction to that. Bill, let me start with you, and then Jack. BROWDER: Well, first of all, Putin may not be spending his time on it, but I guarantee you the FSB, the successor organization to the KGB, is. And the other thing is that Putin is a boldfaced liar. He lies about everything. And so, I wouldn't believe a word he says in any -- in any speech he ever gets. He said there were no Russian troops in Ukraine until after they took over Crimea. He's a liar. MACCALLUM: Jack, what do you think? BARSKY: This may be somewhat possible. You don't follow just any old businessman, but they do this -- the KGB has done it routinely. You know, anybody you can entrap, you will so I don't know, and we really don't know until we know what's happening in intelligence and very often the truth doesn't come out until ten, 20, 30, 40 years later. MACCALLUM: Fascinating. Great to have both of you with us today. Thank you very much, Jack and Bill. You certainly know of what you speak. We will see you again soon, gentlemen. Thank you so much. So coming up next, media reaction to the Trump-Putin summit tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL KRISTON, EDITOR AT LARGE, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Today turned what has been an ongoing problem of Donald Trump and as a President in terms of his attitude towards and behavior towards Russia, towards President Putin has turned a problem into a crisis almost. And I really don't know where we go from here. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Howie Kurtz, Byron York, and Andrew McCarthy coming up next. Plus, Sacha Baron Cohen has been doping politicians in the fake and embarrassing interviews for decades. But when it came to Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, things didn't go exactly as planned. He joins me, coming up next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: You want me to say on television that I support three and four-year-olds with firearms? (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: As President, I cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease partisan critics or the media, or Democrats who want to do nothing but resist and obstruct. Constructive dialogue between the United States and Russia affords the opportunity to open new pathways towards peace and stability in our world. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: The high-stakes Trump-Putin summit in the media reaction was intense today. Here now on that, Howard Kurtz, Host of \"MediaBuzz\" and Author of the new book Media Madness: Donald Trump, the Press and the War over Truth, Andrew McCarthy is a former Federal Prosecutor and Byron York, chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner. Both are Fox News Contributors. Gentlemen, thank you all for being here this evening. You know, Byron, a lot of very tough reaction to what we saw in there today, the president getting hit from all sides, Newt Gingrich saying it's the biggest mistake of his presidency to date and it's clear from the tweet that the president sent on his way out of town that he knows that there is fixing to be done. BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I think when assessing the reaction you have to look at some of the usual suspects who freak out about Trump every single day and they are flipping out now. You can maybe discount some of that stuff, separate those from the people who have been more balanced on Trump and who have not gotten upset with everything he's done who believe that today he made a serious mistake. And his serious mistake was not taking the side of not only U.S. intelligence agencies, but the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate and taking their side over election meddling over the Russians. MACCALLUM: Yes. YORK: And that was the significant, a significant mistake that the president is going to have to fix. MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, to hear the president say that, you know, well, I know our intelligence folks, and how are you can take this one first, if you would. Dan Coats said what he said. They believed that, you know, there was meddling. But President Putin gave a very strong and powerful denial to that and I can't see why he would have done it. How does that strike you? HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, in that moment under the white hot spotlight in Helsinki, it seemed to almost everyone was watching, the president of the United States was siding with Putin, was taking the word of this former KGB spy over his own U.S. intelligence agencies. And that's why the intense media criticism has cut across the usual partisan lines. I mean, you have news anchors like CNN's Anderson Cooper saying one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president. Of course you have Obama administration liberals, even David Axelrod on CNN, usually sober minded, he likened it to Neville Chamberlain after meeting Hitler. I think some of that is over the top. But when you have Newt Gingrich, and he's a Trump ally, when you have conservatives, others on Fox News, when you have the national view on the Weekly Standard all saying that these were serious stumbles, serious missteps on such a global stage, I think it's clear that the president gave his detractors a lot of ammunition today. MACCALLUM: Andy? ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I really think the problem begins, Martha, with having the summit in the first place. I do not understand the obsession with this whole idea that we have to have good relations with Russia. We've done perfectly fine in the past at times not having good relations with Russia. Russia is an anti-American aggressive thug country and the only way we can have good relations with them is if we accommodate what it is that makes them a terrible regime. So I think the mistake is almost inevitable from today in the sense that the mistake was having this forum in the first place where the United States president has to be in the presence of this autocrat, this despot and treat him as if he were a statesman. MACCALLUM: Yes. So you have to ask yourself, Byron, why, right? It's very clear that the president went into this moment, this news conference. He wanted to present a, you know, we've turned a page, that all that changed four hours ago. He is very determined to show that he's going to have a different relationship with this man. He said it all through the campaign and he worked very hard and bent over backwards, some might say, to achieve that today. He clearly wants to, you know, have better trade relationships with them. Vladimir Putin was talking to Chris Wallace about cars and, you know, the kind of business agreements they could reach where cars are concerned, and possibly wants to peel him away in some respects from President Xi in China. He sees perhaps an alliance between these two countries, United States and Russia, as something that might be a bulwark against China. Your thoughts on any of that. YORK: All of those are perfectly legitimate geopolitical issues, but the president's problem today stems from his apparent obsession with the Trump- Russia investigation, or at least the part of the investigation that targets him. And he basically is not able to separate the two parts of the Trump-Russia investigation. MACCALLUM: Yes. YORK: There is the - what Russia did part of the investigation, which tries to find out what Russian measures were attempting to influence the campaign. And then there's the - get Trump part of the investigation, which Democrats are using to try to disable the president, possibly remove him from office. It's perfectly legitimate to fight back on the latter, but not so much in the former because there is bipartisan agreement of these Russian efforts, and yet, the president appears to believe that if he gives even an inch on conceding that there was this Russian effort, then they will all take a mile in the effort to get Trump. MACCALLUM: Yes. It would have been refreshingly different to hear the president say, you know what, forget about me, there's no collusion, which he did say, there's none of that, but you know, my folks at home are pretty clear that there was some meddling. You guys meddled; a lot of countries try to get in the middle of other countries elections. That's not going to happen anymore and just moved on. But I want to get back for a moment to the media response because we have a montage I want to play and then I would like to get you to sort of weigh in on what we see here. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Perhaps one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president at a summit in front of a Russian leader truly that I've ever seen. JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: And I've never seen an American president simply surrender to the leader of Russia. You should call this the surrender summit. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A patriot is someone who defends the honor of their country. We just saw the president of the United States do the exact opposite. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Separating the difference between his election win and Russian interference in the election is a difficult thing rhetorically I think for this president because a lot of times it's about him. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Howie? KURTZ: You know, I often think that when President Trump goes too far, said something offensive or makes a mistake, his critics sort of play into his hands by going over the top. I mean, some of this talk we are hearing from John Brennan about treason and so forth I think is over-the-top. He made some serious mistakes today and then of course the press ratchets it up to 11 as they do on just about everything, but the fact that it is also coming from the Republican side, from the conservative side, from people like Newt Gingrich I think drives home the point that -- I don't agree there shouldn't have been a summit. American presidents spoke to Soviet leaders from the worst years of the Cold War, Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons. We need to deal with Russia. But knowing this was going to come up, the fact that the president couldn't find a way to say let's not litigate the past, let's move on and said steam seemed to side with Putin over Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, for example, I think has dug m into political hole and I don't think this is a one or two day story. MACCALLUM: Let's see what Dan Coats does next. Gentlemen, thank you. Great to see you all tonight. MCCARTHY: Thank you. KURTZ: Thanks, Martha. MACCALLUM: So still to come, the Democratic Party turns its back on powerful Senator Dianne Feinstein. And how did comedian Sacha Baron Cohen managed to infiltrate Congress and convince so many to support an absurd cause like arming 3-year-old children? Congressman Matt Gaetz almost fell for the trap and survived and he is up next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER SEN. TRENT LOTT, R-MISS.I: I support the kindergarten program. We in America would be wise to implement it too. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Developing tonight, a number of current and former lawmakers are doing a little bit of damage control after the comedian who brought us \"Borat\" managed to trick them getting them to say on camera that they support arming preschoolers. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LOTT: I support the kindergartens program. We in America would be wise to implement it too. REP. JOE WILSON, R-S.C.: A 3-year-old cannot defend itself from an assault rifle by throwing a Hello Kitty pencil case at it. Our founding fathers did not put an age limit on the Second Amendment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In less than a month, less than a month, a first grader can become a first grenader. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: It is all part of Sacha Baron Cohen's new Showtime series. Fortunately, Congressman Matt Gaetz did not completely fall for it. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: You want me to say on television that I support three and 4-year-olds with firearms? Is that what you're asking me to do? SACHA BARON COHEN, COMEDIAN: Yes. (CROSSTALK) GAETZ: Typically members of Congress don't just hear a story about a program and indicate whether they supported or not. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz joins me now. Pretty unbelievable, some of these things that he got people to say. What was it like when you were in there with him, and how did you figure it out? GAETZ: Well, Martha, as politicians, we should take the work we do very seriously, but we should not always take ourselves so seriously. I think it's hilarious that Sacha Baron Cohen duped me into an interview and got some of my colleagues to say some bizarre things, but he came into our office and really it was quite deceptive. They set up entire web sites dedicated to this documentary that they were doing about policies in Israel and how those affected the United States, and so it appeared very normal until the questioning went a little awry and something didn't really seem right to me. And so I was trying to not say anything all that newsworthy. MACCALLUM: I mean, he looks like he has a mouth that he could peel off, you know. Didn't that occur to you? GAETZ: Well, he would not be the only dude who runs around Washington with a great deal of makeup on, Martha. That happens in this town a little bit more than it does in regular America. MACCALLUM: Right. GAETZ: And so it didn't surprise me just to see someone conducting an interview with makeup. MACCALLUM: Let's watch this from former Illinois Congressman Joe Walsh. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER REP. JOE WALSH, R-ILL.: And so I'm reading this, Michael, off of a teleprompter and I'm thinking to myself, while this is kind of crazy. The alarm went off, but the alarm really went off about 3 o'clock that next morning when I said, my God, I've been duped. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I can't -- why were they reading stuff off of teleprompters in the first place? I mean, it seems a little odd for a congressman to, you know, be put in that position and just sort of agree to say these ridiculous things about arming three and four year olds and agree to say that into a camera and a teleprompter? GAETZ: I agree. They asked me to read off of a teleprompter as well and I told him that's not something I do. I just try to share my sincere reactions to their questions without going with their script and again, that's probably why it didn't work with me. But yes. I mean, members of Congress should think about the things they say. We shouldn't just regurgitate the words in front of us, and, you know, again this was sort of a funny example of that going wrong. MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, I guess it's funny. It's a little disturbing to be honest, you know, to watch members of Congress being willing to say these things and I think that's what Sacha Baron Cohen is trying to accomplish. He's trying to, in a way, you know, make fun of you guys and basically suggest that you are willing to say or do just about anything if you think there's maybe a good political reason behind it. GAETZ: Or if there's a camera pointed at us, maybe there are far too many members of Congress willing to read any teleprompter words if it means the camera light is on. But, yes, either way, you know, that's humor. It's ironic humor that's indicative of Sacha Baron Cohen style, though, I think that sometimes he goes far over the line. He has created some funny moments on television and I got a good laugh out of it. MACCALLUM: Yes. He has created some funny moments. I would agree with you there. Sarah Palin is definitely not laughing about what he did to her, impersonating a wounded veteran. I want to switch gears for a moment. Because I know that you have Lisa Page on the Hill today. She is the former lover of Peter Strzok, who everybody has heard so much about. We watched her walk through the hallways and she went in to answer some questions. What can you tell us about that? GAETZ: There was one text message that speaks to -- it was contemporaneous with the time Comey was fired and there's a message about needing to open up a certain case while Andy McCabe is the acting director. In previous, behind closed doors interviews, Mr. Rosenstein has indicated to members of Congress that that did not involve Russia. Peter Strzok did not answer that question and Lisa Page I believe answered it in a way that is inconsistent with Rod Rosenstein's prior statements behind closed doors and if, in fact, they were trying to open up a Russia case because someone was the acting director that wouldn't have been opened otherwise, that shows the bias not just in people's hearts, but in their actions as they were conducting investigations. That's what we were trying to prove, that bias resulted in the change of the investigative activities which has been detrimental to the president and to the country. MACCALLUM: Is there any indication that she will undermine Peter Strzok? GAETZ: Well, if she's answering questions that Strzok won't answer, then it certainly gives us more of an illumination of the facts. And I found Lisa Page far more forthcoming and honest than I found Peter Strzok. MACCALLUM: Interesting. Very interesting. Congressman Gaetz, thank you very much. GAETZ: Thank you. MACCALLUM: I promise this is a real interview. Good to see you tonight. Thank you, sir. GAETZ: Good to see you. MACCALLUM: So coming up next, the Democratic socialist known as the rising star of the progressive left says capitalism will, quote, \"not always exist.\" And that's not the only crazy thing that she just said. Mark Penn and Tezlyn Figaro join me next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK: Capitalism has not always existed in the world and it will not always exist in the world. When this country started we were not a capitalist, we did not operate on a capitalist economy. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: A big political shock in California where the Democratic Party does not endorse Senator Dianne Feinstein for reelection despite her 25 years of service. The party instead chose to back her opponent, progressive grassroots candidate state Senator Kevin de Leon. So what does this mean for the future of the Democratic Party there and elsewhere? Joining me now, Mark Penn, president and managing partner of the Stagwell Group and served as pollster for the Clintons. As well as Tezlyn Figaro, -- Figaro -- Tezlyn Figaro, CEO of Tezlyn Figaro Communications Group and former Bernie Sanders national staffer like the opera. Tezlyn, good to see you tonight. Let me start with you, if I may. Your reaction to that and what does it mean for Dianne Feinstein do you think? TEZLYN FIGARO, CEO, TEZLYN FIGARO COMMUNICATIONS GROUP: I think what it means for the Democratic Party is people any time people endorse a candidate that really doesn't have a shot in the Hill, it says a lot about where, you know, the party is and where it stands. You know, California being at all Democratic state but still haven't been able to push issues like Medicare for all. I don't even know if it's about people voting to say where we want a really left-wing candidate, but more so against the establishment and business as usual. You know, although the senator has done great work, you know, within the party, she has also been in office for a very long time and I think people are just fed up with the status quo. So I think it really is a message about the greater issue, why people voted for Senator Bernie Sanders, why people voted for President Trump. You know, I have to say it out that people are just really tired of business as usual. MACCALLUM: Yes, but those -- you know, there's a real progressive move in the Democratic Party, and Mark, when you look at that, Dianne Feinstein, you know, really represents a very moderate, longtime Democrat who looks a lot more like Democrats used to look perhaps. MARK PENN, FORMER CLINTON POLLSTER AND ADVISER: Well, let's remember here that there was a jungle primary out in California and that Dianne Feinstein got 44 percent and her opponent here got 11 percent. The Republican even got less than that. So really this is out of step with what I think the people of California and the voters and the bulk of the Democratic Party really want, so it's unfortunate that some of the machinery of the party in different places is out of step with the mainstream of Democratic voters. MACCALLUM: It's going to be really interesting to see how all of this pans out in the actual elections. I mean, as you point out, she may have the staying power if those jungle primary numbers hold up. I just want to play this from the candidate Ocasio-Cortez in New York. Because it goes to the heart of what these very progressive Democrats are really looking at and are proponents of if they are elected. Watch this. This is on socialism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OCASIO-CORTEZ: Right now, we have this no holds barred Wild West hyper capitalism. What that means is profit at any cost. Capitalism has not always existed in the world and it will not always exist in the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So we're going to -- you know, capitalism -- Mark, do you want to take that on first? PENN: Well, in the Harvard CAPS Harris poll a few months ago I asked Americans, do you want socialism or capitalism? And by 90 to 10 they said capitalism. And when I looked at the Republican figures it was 6-94 and when I looked at the Democratic figures I think it was 16-84. So the overwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans believe capitalism and competition produce a better society and believe that quite deeply. So I know each party has fringe elements and has extremes and we've got to pay more respect to the middle of what America thinks. MACCALLUM: Tezlyn? FIGARO: I completely agree. You know, I was on the Sanders campaign but I let people know all the time I did not believe in socialism when it came down to business, fair trade, competition. I do believe in socializing medicine. I do think that there needs to be Medicare for all. But it is very important for us, especially black businesses like myself started a staffing firm with zero employees went to 300 employees. People like Donald Mooney in San Antonio that came out of the system that now employed hundreds of thousands of employees across the country. It was the private sector that did that. It was the private sector that gave felons second opportunities when the government did not. So I am absolutely against one, business owners being classified as capitalist and greed. There's a big difference between corporate greed and the spirit of entrepreneurship. And that's been lost in the conversation, particularly within the African-American community when it comes to business. Business people are not bad people. We are here to make a difference, we're here to pay people, you know, to pay people when the government decides not to and I'm just not interested in the government writing my check. What we are interested in is having access to capital, fair access to contracts awarded, but certainly not the government telling us how to run our business. MACCALLUM: It's been a pretty successful system in this country that has afforded a lot of people a standard of living that doesn't exist in most of the world. Mark, thank you very much. Tezlyn, good to see you. More of The Story coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: That is our story for tonight. Thanks for being with us. Tucker is up next with a preview of his interview with President Trump. We'll see you right back here tomorrow night 7 p.m. Eastern in New York City. Have a great night, everybody.

            "article_content": "Across the country, far-left progressives and democratic socialists suffered decisive electoral defeats in Tuesday's primaries, despite high-profile barnstorming efforts by left-leaning leaders like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The routs were a sign not only that Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders may lack the star power necessary to bolster candidates, but also that national enthusiasm for socialism is generally weak as the U.S. economy posts strong unemployment numbers and sustained growth. Earlier this month, former\u00a0President Barack Obama pointedly declined to endorse Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist candidate in New York's 14th Congressional District, in a snub that underscored the challenges facing progressives campaigning to the left of the Democratic Party establishment in hopes of taking their views mainstream. For Sanders, who vied for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2016 presidential race and may run again in 2020, the defeats Tuesday were a continuation of his recent losing streak. Over the past two years, several candidates he has backed in several important races -- including in gubernatorial primaries in Virginia and Ohio, and in several House races in Iowa and New Jersey -- have come up short. Ocasio-Cortez, who unseated longtime establishment Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in a shocking June primary win, tweeted an acknowledgement of the rough day on Wednesday. \"Wins in the short-term are important milemarkers and necessary to building power,\" she wrote. \"But you can\u2019t be afraid of loss. Fear keeps people from accomplishing great things.\" Such losses were plentiful for Ocasio-Cortez this week. Abdul El-Sayed, an avowed populist who was vying to be Michigan's first Muslim governor, finished nearly 20 percentage points behind establishment Democrat Gretchen Whitmer in Tuesday's primary. DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE SNAPS AT REPORTER FOR ASKING ABOUT SOCIALISM: 'YOU F--KING KIDDING ME'? Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez had aggressively trumpeted El-Sayed, who had advocated a $15 minimum wage, universal health care and free college tuition for families making under $150,000 annually. At a rally in Detroit this week, Sanders -- who defied expectations by winning the Michigan primary against Hillary Clinton in 2016 -- called El-Sayed's platform \"very bold.\" Bernie Sanders campaigns for populist doctor Abdul El-Sayed, who was defeated in Tuesday's primaries in Michigan. (AP) And\u00a0Fayrouz Saad, who was angling Tuesday night to become the first Muslim woman elected to Congress, finished in a distant fourth place in Michigan's 11th Congressional District primary, despite support on the stump from Ocasio-Cortez. In Missouri,\u00a0Rep. Lacy Clay soundly defeated Cori Bush, who was also supported by both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. Ocasio-Cortez had spent a day in July in St. Louis campaigning on Bush's behalf, and called her \"one of the most inspiring people I've ever met in my life.\" Before the vote, Bush, 42, had sounded a note of optimism despite polls showing Clay to be the clear favorite: \"I actually feel like we have the momentum. I believe that we have what we need to be successful.\" And in Kansas, former Sanders staffer Brent Welder narrowly lost to\u00a0Sharice Davids in the race for the Republican-held 3rd Congressional District, which Clinton carried in 2016. Democratic socialists had hoped a Welder win would prove their broad appeal to urban voters. OCASIO-CORTEZ SHUNS WEST COAST ELITES IN WEST COAST TOUR James Thompson, another Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez candidate, won his primary for Kansas' 4th Congressional District, but he is widely expected to lose in November against Republican Rep. Ron Estes. The race will be a rematch of the 2017 special election betwene Estes and Thompson in the largely Republican district. Meanwhile, in Washington State, 30-year-old Sarah Smith billed herself as running on the \"same slate as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\" and she was recruited by the same group that had backed the Bronx democratic socialist. But Smith's challenge to longtime Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith in Tuesday's 9th\u00a0Congressional District primary appeared unsuccessful as votes rolled in -- and the incumbent suggested that demographics were a major reason why his challenger could not replicate Ocasio-Cortez's success. \u201cHave you been to Queens, N.Y.?\u201d Smith said in an interview with The Seattle Times before the vote, noting that Ocasio-Cortez is a Latina running in a strongly Hispanic district. \u201cQueens is not SeaTac or Seattle, I am not Joe Crowley, and Sarah Smith is not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Other than that, the comparison\u2019s perfect.\u201d However, there was a bright spot for Ocasio-Cortez in the heavily gerrymandered, hyper-Democratic 13th Congressional District in Michigan, where\u00a0Rashida Tlaib won the nod to replace retiring Rep. John Conyers. He announced his retirement amid sexual harassment allegations. Tlaib will effectively run unopposed in November's general election, making it all but certain that she'll become the first Muslim woman elected to Congress. She is also poised to become the second card-carrying member of the Democratic Socialists of America in Congress.",

Many pundits are predicting a blue wave will bring Democrats to power in this year\u2019s congressional elections. But an even bluer wave is surging into the party's primaries this year, lifting far-left candidates over moderates\u00a0\u2014 and potentially causing problems for the party's midterm hopes. Primary after Democratic primary has featured a progressive candidate versus a moderate, with the liberal alternative often winning. Scott Wallace, shown with his wife, Christy, is running for Congress in Pennsylvania. (COURTESY SCOTT WALLACE CAMPAIGN) A case study in the ascendant progressive wing was Pennsylvania\u2019s 1st Congressional District primary race earlier this month, featuring Scott Wallace versus Rachel Reddick. Reddick seemed the perfect candidate \u2014 a mother, a veteran and only 33. 'Democrats will be united as never before.' Politically, however, she was seen as fairly moderate \u2014 a Republican until recently, in fact. And Wallace, a multimillionaire who had long supported liberal causes, had the backing of many local Democrats and the wherewithal to outspend his opponent. The primary wasn\u2019t close. He won by more than 20 percentage points. In an interview with Fox News, Wallace proudly claimed the progressive mantle: \u201cTo me, it means values weighted toward the people, rather than corporations and the wealthy.\u201d Henry Wallace and FDR (COURTESY: SCOTT WALLACE) CLICK FOR SENATE RACE RATINGS AND FULL MIDTERM COVERAGE Wallace, 66, has never run for office before, but, as he explains, he\u2019s got a long political history. His grandfather, Henry Wallace, served as FDR\u2019s vice president. And, Wallace notes, he himself has worked as staff counsel on two U.S. Senate committees and heads a foundation that attempts to bring citizens' voices into the political debate. He moved back to his home state to run because, he says, he couldn\u2019t \u201csit on the sidelines this time around.\u201d Wallace said \u201cthe most fundamental values of our American democracy are under assault as never before \u2013 a free press, an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and basic respect for truth, facts and science.\u201d Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., speaks during the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force news conference on the release of the 2018 legislative agenda for the 115th Congress on Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2018. (CQ Roll Call via AP Images) The central message of his campaign is to serve \u201ceveryday people,\u201d he said. His platform, though, is squarely aligned with the party's left flank: Medicare for All, transitioning to renewable energy and \u201csafeguarding Social Security from Republican assault.\u201d That worked in the primary. Whether it will work in a general election is far from certain. Polls show a close race in the general election battle against against incumbent Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick won in 2016 by 9 percentage points, but since then his district has been redrawn by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and no one is sure if it trends blue or red. Wallace believes the previous map was gerrymandered \u201cjust enough to guarantee a Republican win ... the effect of the new map is modest \u2014 but perhaps just enough to make a huge difference.\u201d Wallace thinks Fitzpatrick\u2019s record of voting with President Trump and the Republican agenda won\u2019t play well with the electorate. He adds his opponent has cast \u201cvotes that serve his corporate donors rather than the people.\u201d But Wallace himself has been accused of being a rich man who\u2019s out of touch with regular folks. Said Team Fitzpatrick spokesperson Haley Bova:\u00a0\u201cThe Lugar Center at Georgetown University ranked Brian Fitzpatrick as the No. 1 most bipartisan freshman congressman in the nation, and Scott Wallace is the most far-left extremist candidate to ever run for Congress in the history of this district. This district has zero appetite for the ultra-left extremist views of Scott Wallace and the hate groups that he has showered his millions of dollars upon.\" The Republican National Committee cited the Pennsylvania primary among several earlier this month producing candidates who \"will be unappealing to general election voters.\" Wallace responds that his money allows him \u201cto decline all corporate PAC money.\u201d Further, he said, \u201cI grew up here, waiting tables, pumping gas, working as a carpenter\u2019s assistant, night manager at the Doylestown Burger Chef, and reporter for the local Bucks Country magazine.\u201d For his part, Fitzpatrick has also played up his roots in the community, as well as his service as an FBI agent. \"His whole life has been about protecting our nation and serving our communities,\" a recent ad declares. All eyes are on his district as a bellwether for whether liberal nominees help or hurt the Democratic Party in November. But Wallace doesn\u2019t accept there\u2019s a civil war going on within his party, as some claim. \u201cDemocrats will be united as never before,\u201d he said, noting the opponents he defeated are behind him. \u201cI don\u2019t think voters care much about political labels. What they want are policies that are pro-people,\u201d he said. Fox News' Kristine Kotta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cynthia Nixon are self-proclaimed Democratic Socialists. A look at the Democratic Socialists of America and what the organization stands for. As Democratic socialists chalk up victories across the country during primary season, there are indications that the wave is having an impact on the Democratic Party at large. Backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a slew of liberal candidates have pulled off upsets in Democratic primaries across the country this year by embracing a Democratic socialist platform, with agenda items such as implementing Medicare-for-all, free college tuition, abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and impeaching President Trump. Among candidates embraced by the left wing of the party who have won primaries in major contests this year: New York Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Maryland Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous and Florida Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum. The results have been a mixed bag, however, with a number of candidates falling flat. Most notably, \u201cSex and the City\u201d actress and New York gubernatorial challenger Cynthia Nixon was soundly beaten by establishment Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo last week despite a high-profile campaign. Cuomo mocked the idea of a left-wing wave in remarks Friday, saying that his brand of pragmatic progressivism was where the real revolution was. \u201cThat is a revolution,\u201d he said of his win, according to The New York Daily News. \u201cThat is a wave. On the numbers. Not on some Twittersphere dialogue where I tweet you and you tweet me and between the two of us, we think we have a wave. We\u2019re not even a ripple.\u201d But there is no sign that left-wing push is slowing down and party elders are warning the party not to go too far to the left. Even the liberal former President Jimmy Carter is expressing concern that Democrats could alienate independents. \u201cIndependents need to know they can invest their vote in the Democratic Party,\u201d Carter said Tuesday during a speech at his post-presidential center and library in Atlanta. Joe Lieberman, who was the Democratic Party's candidate for vice president in 2000, said in an interview with Fox News last month that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s ideas will struggle to gain support across America. \"When I see somebody who really says she's a socialist -- she's a very captivating, charismatic candidate -- when you look at those policies, those policies will not be supported in many places across America,\" Lieberman said. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ SHUNS HOLLYWOOD ELITES IN WEST COAST TOUR House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has also expressed concerns about the left-wing\u2019s push for the impeachment of Trump, calling it a \u201cgift\u201d to Republicans. Pelosi told Politico in May that impeachment was popular in her district, but that she still didn\u2019t support it: \u201cI\u2019m not walking away from impeachment for political reasons and I\u2019m not walking toward it for political reasons. I just think it\u2019s divisive and I think what we should do is always try to unify.\u201d But there are signs that the groundswell of hard-leftism is having an effect on more mainstream, national candidates. For instance, while Cuomo brushed off Nixon\u2019s challenge, he had also dipped his toe into some left-wing positions such as abolishing ICE, at the same time as Nixon was calling it a \u201cterrorist organization.\u201d Controversially, Cuomo took a left-wing turn in August and declared that America \u201cwas never that great.\u201d \u201cWe have not reached greatness, we will reach greatness when every America is fully engaged, we will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51 percent of our population, is gone,\u201d he said. \"I think this is just another example of Andrew Cuomo trying to figure out what a progressive sounds like and missing by a mile,\" Nixon told NY1. Top 2020 Democratic prospects have also started endorsing some of those radical ideas. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, have all expressed support for abolishing or overhauling ICE. President Barack Obama recently voiced his support for Medicare-for-all healthcare plans. Polls are showing increasing support for socialism, once a dirty word in American political discourse. According to a Gallup poll released in August, more Democrats view socialism positively than they do capitalism. Fifty-seven percent of Democrats polled by Gallup have a favorable view of socialism, while just 47 percent of Democrats in the poll have positive feelings about capitalism. Republicans meanwhile, are licking their lips at the prospect of a hard-left turn by Democrats. President Trump, in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo in July, predicted that if Democrats push to abolish ICE, they will get beaten in elections. \u201cWell I hope they keep thinking about it. Because they\u2019re going to get beaten so badly,\u201d he said. Fox News\u2019 Alex Pappas and Lukas Mikelionis contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Michael Avenatti headlined a Democratic Party event in Greenfield, New Hampshire. (Fox News) GREENFIELD, N.H. \u2013 Michael Avenatti took aim at President Donald Trump and called on Democrats to \u201cfight fire with fire\u201d as he headlined a Democratic Party event Sunday in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House. The Los Angeles-based attorney, best known for representing adult-film actress Stormy Daniels in her lawsuit against the president, told Fox News and other news organizations that \u201cI\u2019m absolutely being serious\u201d as he mulls a run for the Democratic presidential nomination. And his message to other potential Democratic White House hopefuls is that the 2020 \u201celection is going to be a brutal, knockdown, street fight, and if someone\u2019s not up for that type of campaign, they need to stay home and not seek the nomination.\u201d He also brushed aside any concerns that his law firm's legal issues could hurt him politically. Headlining the Hillsborough County Democrats summer picnic and fundraiser, Avenatti repeatedly fired away at the president, saying to big applause that \u201cDonald Trump does not have the knowledge, wisdom, compassion or fortitude to serve as president of the United States.\u201d But he added that \u201cthis president, no matter how corrupt or cruel he is, he knows how to fight.\u201d Avenatti said that Democrats \u201chave a tendency to bring nail clippers to a gunfight\u201d and he told the crowd of party officials, candidates and activists, \u201cI believe that our party, the Democratic Party, must be a party that fights fire with fire. I believe we cannot be the party of turning the other cheek.\u201d And as he did during a stop last weekend in Iowa \u2013 the state that holds the first-in-the-nation caucus \u2013 Avenatti modified a slogan made famous by former first lady Michelle Obama, urging that \u201cwhen they (Republicans) go low, we hit harder.\u201d He closed his nearly 25-minute speech with a variation of Trump\u2019s signature campaign line, saying, \u201cWe will make America gracious again. We will make America fair again. We will make America dynamic again. We will make America respected. And above all else, we will make America America again.\u201d Avenatti arrived in New Hampshire from Florida, where he headlined a Democratic Party event in Tampa Saturday night. He told reporters he\u2019s headed back to Iowa in a few days and announced he\u2019d return to New Hampshire in late September. I don\u2019t think [President Trump is] very quick on his feet. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that intelligent and I think he\u2019d be completely outclassed. Pushing back against charges that his political testing of the waters is a publicity stunt, Avenatti argued, \u201cI\u2019m not going to go out and do this and give speeches like this and talk to people on some lark. I\u2019m going to seriously consider this because the 2020 election is a critical election, I would venture to say the most critical in modern times.\u201d Avenatti warned, \u201cIf the Democratic Party proceeds to nominate the person who would be the best president, that is going to be a mistake.\u201d He said 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton \u201cwas the most qualified individual to ever run for the White House in the history of our nation.\u201d LIZ PEEK: IS AVENATTI READY TO RUN? HIS LEFT-WING MEDIA ALLIES CERTAINLY THINK SO! But he added that \u201call the experience in the world, all the qualifications in the world, all of the policy positions in the world, they don\u2019t mean anything if you can\u2019t beat Donald Trump in the general election, period.\u201d Avenatti said, \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t want to debate me on a national stage. That\u2019s for sure. There\u2019s no question about that.\u201d (Fox News) Asked how he would take the fight to the president, a confident Avenatti claimed, \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t want to debate me on a national stage. That\u2019s for sure. There\u2019s no question about that.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s a bully and I think he doesn\u2019t like people who punch back and I think I\u2019d be incredibly effective against him,\u201d Avenatti added. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s very quick on his feet. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that intelligent and I think he\u2019d be completely outclassed.\u201d AVENATTI: 'I'M EXPLORING A RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES' Avenatti\u2019s firm Eagan Avenatti was settling a case with the Internal Revenue Service over $880,000 in unpaid payroll taxes. The firm had defaulted on millions of dollars in debt and had fallen years behind in paying its payroll taxes. Asked by Fox News if he was concerned his firm\u2019s legal issues could affect his hopes of running for the White House, Avenatti said, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it.

All rights reserved) A first-time Democratic candidate looking to flip a Washington state U.S. House seat appeared to distance herself from party leader Nancy Pelosi during a private fundraiser in the Seattle-area earlier this month. A spokeswoman for Kim Schrier, who is running against Republican Dino Rossi for the 8th Congressional District seat of retiring U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Auburn, was recently asked if the candidate attended a fundraiser to support the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The spokeswoman, Katie Rodihan, responded by pointing to U.S. Rep. Susan DelBene, the finance chair for the DCCC who also hosts a similar fundraiser each year, the Seattle Times reported. \u201cI believe Suzan DelBene had Nancy Pelosi here for a fundraiser,\u201d Rodihan said. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking Nancy Pelosi\u2019s money. We were not hosting the event, not part of it.\u201d Democrat Kim Schrier is running against Republican Dino Rossi for the 8th Congressional District seat in Washington state. (Facebook) When a reporter pressed Rodihan on the question, she said Schrier did stop by and it had not been on her schedule until she was asked to make an appearance at the last minute by DelBene. Schrier may not be taking Pelosi\u2019s money, but the DCCC has spent around $1.5 million to help her in the form of negative TV ads against Rossi. Pelosi, D-Calif., the House Minority Leader, has become a lightning rod for Republicans who seek to tie her to Democratic candidates much in the same way Democrats are doing with Republicans running for office and President Trump. \u201cKim Schrier would support Nancy Pelosi and raise taxes on hardworking middle-class families,\u201d said Michael Byerly, a spokesman for the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican political-action committee that spent more than $850,000 in support of Rossi. \u201cWashington families deserve better than Kim Schrier.\u201d She\u2019s also faced criticism within her own party. Rodihan said Schrier didn\u2019t want to be drawn into a debate about Pelosi until after the midterm elections but has said she is open to new leadership in the Democratic Party. \u201cI see the party changing a lot \u2026 I think that the leadership needs to reflect the new party and that probably means it\u2019s not going to be Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Schrier said in July. \u201cI think that it would be nice to have a woman in some sort of leadership position. She\u2019s the only woman in a leadership position, but I think that the leadership really needs to reflect this new, energized, forward-thinking party.\u201d Pelosi has said in past interviews that calls by some for her to relinquish her role in the party are due to sexism. She still has defenders and has raised millions for the DCCC. The fundraiser in Washington state drew 70 guests and raised $900,000, a Pelosi spokesman told the Times. Previously, some other Democratic candidates have shown reluctance when asked if they would commit their support behind Pelosi. One count in August revealed more than 50 candidates and incumbents would not back her should the party take back the 23-seat majority from the Republicans.",

            "article_content": "Progressive democrat and Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley is now set to become the first African-American woman elected to Congress in Massachusetts. Here is what you need to know. Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley unseated 10-term U.S. Rep. Michael Capuano in a Democratic primary Tuesday in the latest shakeup of the House Democratic caucus by a far-left challenger. Capuano conceded defeat to Pressley in the race to represent Massachusetts' 7th District approximately 30 minutes before The Associated Press formally called the race. With 69 percent of precincts reporting late Tuesday, Pressley had the lead by 10,682 votes. Pressley, who is running unopposed in November, is set to become the first African-American woman elected to Congress from the Commonwealth. Capuano is the fourth House member to lose a primary this year, along with Reps. Robert Pittenger, R-N.C.; Mark Sanford, R-S.C., and fellow 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y. The prospect of a Pressley upset had drawn some comparisons to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's defeat of Crowley in June. The New York democratic socialist had endorsed Pressley, as did Our Revolution, the offshoot of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. However, unlike Crowley, Capuano had fiercely contested the Massachusetts race by racking up endorsements, attending debates and highlighting his consistently liberal voting record in one of the most Democratic districts in a traditionally Democratic state. And unlike Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old political neophyte, the 44-year-old Pressley has a track record in Massachusetts' halls of power. She served as former Secretary of State John Kerry's political director when he was a U.S. senator and became the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council in 2009. Ayanna Pressley celebrated her victory with supporters Tuesday night. (AP) Greeting voters at a Boston polling station earlier Tuesday, Pressley spoke of \"the ground shifting beneath our feet and the wind at our backs.\" \"This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy,\" she told reporters. \"This is a disruptive candidacy, a grassroots coalition. It is broad and diverse and deep. People of every walk of life.\" Pressley has backed Medicare-for-all and called for defunding Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She likely was aided by the demographics of the 7th district, which cuts a north-south swathe through the city of Boston and includes portions of neighboring Chelsea, Everett, Randolph, Milton and Somerville -- where Capuano served as mayor for nine years in the 1990s. PRO-TRUMP REPUBLICAN WINS PRIMARY TO TAKE ON SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN State lawmakers designated the district as the first majority-minority district in Massachusetts. Just a third of the population is white, with blacks, Hispanics and Asians constituting most of the other two-thirds. However, Pressley had bristled at the notion that race was a defining issue in her campaign. \"I have been really furious about the constant charges being lobbed against me about identity politics that, by the way, are only lobbed against women and candidates of color,\" she said in one debate. \"I happen to be black and a woman and unapologetically proud to be both, but that is not the totality of my identity.\" The contest also formed sharp divides among Boston's Democratic political and media elite. The city's mayor, Marty Walsh, campaigned with Capuano in the final days of the race. U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy, a grandson of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, also endorsed the incumbent, calling him \"a guy who won't shy away from steep odds or tough truths.\" OPINION: IS THIS WOMAN THE GOP'S OCASIO-CORTEZ? Pressley was backed by state Attorney General Maura Healey, who repeatedly has challenged the Trump administration's policies on on immigration, gun control and other issues. She also was endorsed by The Boston Globe, which called her \"the future of the Democratic Party.\" The last time an incumbent Democratic House member in Massachusetts lost a primary was in 2014, when Seth Moulton defeated former Rep. John Tierney, who brought significant personal baggage to the campaign. Fox News' Gregg Re, Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on October 17.\u00a0(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) For many Americans, the Great Recession brought dark days we will never forget \u2013 and never want to repeat. It wasn\u2019t long ago that economists told us sluggish growth and flat wages were here to stay. Pundits talked about a \u201cjobless recovery.\u201d And politicians promised hope and change but never delivered. But now, thanks to Republican leadership, the United States has the best economy in the history of our country \u2013 and hope has finally returned to cities and towns across America. Since I was elected, we have created 4.5 million new jobs. In the last month alone, we added another 250,000 jobs, and nearly a half-million Americans returned to the workforce. We have added nearly 500,000 manufacturing jobs to our economy \u2013 jobs that many self-proclaimed experts said would never return. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in nearly 50 years. More Americans are working today than ever before. And wages are now rising at the fastest rate in a decade. Today, if you want a job, you can get a job. If you want a better job, you can get a better job. African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans have the best job prospects in history. The employment outlook for women is the best in more than 65 years. Students graduating from high school and college are entering the workforce with an abundance of opportunities. These things didn\u2019t happen by accident. They happened because Republicans are putting American workers and families first. To reclaim America\u2019s competitive edge, Republicans passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. In addition to saving the average family $2,000 per year, our tax cuts kicked off a growth boom as businesses expanded and hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign profits flooded back into our country. By doubling the child tax credit, providing a $500 tax credit for non-child dependents, and lowering tax rates, Republicans delivered the tax relief that working families need and deserve. Republicans have waged the largest regulatory reduction campaign in our history \u2013 eliminating unnecessary regulation after unnecessary regulation that killed jobs and drove businesses overseas. We have unleashed American energy resources. We ended ObamaCare\u2019s punitive individual mandate and created new, affordable health-care options with lower premiums for families and businesses.\u00a0And we are fixing broken trade deals and cracking down on foreign trading abuses that have, for decades, plundered America\u2019s wealth. Democrats adamantly, aggressively and hysterically opposed every one of these policies. The top Democrat in Congress even predicted our tax cuts would lead to \u201cArmageddon.\u201d But here we are, two years later, and America has never been more prosperous or more optimistic. Now America faces a critical choice: whether to build on the extraordinary prosperity that Republican policies have delivered for our nation \u2013 or whether to allow Democrats to take control and take a giant wrecking ball to your economy and your future. If House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., take control of Congress, they will drag America back into the economic abyss we struggled so hard to climb out of. The Democrats have promised to raise taxes, restore job-killing regulations, restrict American energy production, and impose socialism through a government takeover of your health care that would bankrupt our country with a $32 trillion price tag. Put simply, the Democrats will pursue economic policies that are the exact opposite of the successful policies that Republicans have implemented. Democratic economic policies will drive our factories overseas, destroy the American health-care system, and obliterate American jobs, American wages and American wealth. We have already tried the Democratic way \u2013 and it produced the worst so-called economic recovery on record. Why would we ever go back? Instead, I am asking you to vote for a Republican House, a Republican Senate, and Republican governors so we can continue the incredible economic success that families across the nation are now enjoying. America\u2019s red-hot economy is the envy of the world, and it is only getting stronger every day. A strong jobs economy helps working Americans lift up the people they love: children, parents, friends, and neighbors. A strong jobs economy also means that our government can protect the American people with the strongest military in the world, protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors, protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, and protect our borders. With your vote for Republican candidates, we can keep our economy growing and our nation on the right track. With your vote, we will keep lifting millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. And together, we will build a future of safety, security, prosperity, and freedom for all our citizens.",

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0A defining debate for Florida politics\u00a0-\u00a0Both parties see surge in primary voters - Farm bill gets delayed in the Senate -\u00a0Audible:\u00a0As they\u2019d say in Greenville\u2026 - Paper, plastic or reptile? A DEFININGa DEBATE FOR FLORIDA POLITICS ORLANDO \u2013 Other than giving us a chance to pick up some Mickey ears and grab a fried grouper sandwich, why is Fox News hosting a Florida gubernatorial debate here tonight? It\u2019s pretty simple: What happens in Florida politics right now may matter more than in any other state. Florida has 29 electoral votes, the same as New York and more than every state except California and Texas. By the time we get to the 2020 Census, the Sunshine State will have gained at least 3 million new residents since 2010 and be ready to join an elite club of three electoral heavyweights. Most importantly, Florida is by far the largest swing state. The shape of America\u2019s political future will be decided in substantial part by what voters here do. So, we tend to care more about the direction and intensity of the political trade winds in Florida than in most places. No Democrat has been elected governor of Florida in 24 years. And in that time, the nominees that Republicans have picked have tried to stick to the model established by\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0in his eight years \u2013 a conciliatory kind of conservatism. Both of those things may change this year. Democrats seem to be coalescing around former Miami Beach Mayor\u00a0Phillip Levine, who got richer than\u00a0Croesus\u00a0in the cruise ship business and then turned his focus to politics. He\u2019s running as a moderate pragmatist with a \u201cget it done\u201d mantra. If he does indeed prevail over top rival Rep.\u00a0Gwen Graham, daughter of longtime Democratic Sen.\u00a0Bob Graham, in the Aug. 28 primary Levine will pose a different kind of opponent than Florida Republicans are used to. Levine\u2019s deep pockets, persuasive delivery and willingness to do battle on behalf of liberal causes like gun control and the environment \u2013 very popular among Floridians \u2013could be very disruptive in a state that has tended to litigate statewide races between the ideological 40-yard lines. But how will Republicans respond? Tonight\u2019s debate will say a great deal about that. It\u2019s hard to be a fixture at anything at age 43, but frontrunner\u00a0Adam Putnam\u00a0has managed to do so. He won election to the state legislature at age 22, served two terms representing his rural Central Florida district before winning a seat in the House and becoming the youngest member of Congress at age 26. He served for a decade as a popular and reliably conservative member of the House. In 2010, he ran for and handily won election as the state\u2019s agricultural commissioner. Where you live, the agriculture commission may not be a big deal, but it is in Florida. The state has\u00a047,000 farms generating nearly $9 billion a year and the agency oversees a great deal beyond just farms. Most importantly for tonight, though, it\u2019s one of five statewide, state-level elected offices. He\u2019s won twice and in 2014 was the top vote getter in the state. Ron DeSantis, on the other hand, is a relative newcomer. Just 36, he has represented a strongly Republican House district in the northeastern part of the state since 2013. He won the first time in a crowded six-way primary in which his background as a Navy lawyer and former federal prosecutor with double Ivy League diplomas helped him stand out. In Congress, he has aligned himself closely first with the populist Freedom Caucus. First as a staunch foe of the Obama administration and now as one of the most outspoken defenders of\u00a0President Trump, DeSantis made himself a nearly ubiquitous presence on cable news. He has taken a back seat to no one in his efforts to derail the investigation of Special Counsel\u00a0Robert Mueller\u00a0and working to discredit the FBI, both of which have made him a favorite of MAGA Republicans across the country. DeSantis has tried to bring that scorched-earth approach to the race here, but so far, that hasn\u2019t been enough to make the difference. Polls here have consistently shown him trailing the better-known Putnam by wide margins. With two months to go and all eyes in Florida politics on a ballroom here at the Gaylord Palms Resort, he\u2019s got the chance to try to reset the race. Can he show that he\u2019s ready to govern a diverse, growing state of 21 million? Can he also demonstrate that he\u2019s ready for a general election fight in a state that is among the most narrowly divided in American politics? Can Putnam adapt to the new populist tone in his party without abandoning the traditional conservative policies that have already made him one of the most popular and successful politicians in the state? We will find out tonight starting at 6:30 ET when moderators\u00a0Bret Baier\u00a0and Martha MacCallum\u00a0start putting them through their paces.

Although other European navigators may have sighted the Florida peninsula before, Ponce de Leon is credited with the first recorded landing and the first detailed exploration of the Florida coast. The Spanish explorer was searching for the \u2018Fountain of Youth,\u2019 a fabled water source that was said to bring eternal youth. Ponce de Leon named the peninsula he believed to be an island \u2018La Florida\u2019 because his discovery came during the time of the Easter feast, or Pascua Florida. In 1521, he returned to Florida in an effort to establish a Spanish colony on the island. However, hostile Native Americans attacked his expedition soon after landing, and the party retreated to Cuba, where Ponce de Leon died from a mortal wound suffered during the battle. Successful Spanish colonization of the peninsula finally began at St. Augustine in 1565, and in 1819 the territory passed into U.S. control under the terms of the Florida Purchase Treaty between Spain and the United States.\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us atHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.

However, Republican voters also are showing up in higher numbers than in previous midterm cycles, a sign that the GOP's fate will be sealed not by apathetic conservatives who sit out Election Day, but by voters open to persuasion from both parties. The Hill's analysis of primary elections held in 30 states so far, through Tuesday night's contests, shows voters in both parties are turning out in higher numbers than in either of the last two midterm elections. Almost 13.8 million people have voted in Democratic primary contests this year \u2014 5 million more than the 8.7 million who had voted in the same states in the 2014 midterm elections, according to data maintained by state elections offices.\u201d Dems come closer to solving \u2018superdelegate\u2019 disagreement -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cThe Democratic National Committee\u2019s two-year debate over its presidential primary rules came closer to resolution Wednesday, as its key rulemaking body voted to curtail the power of unpledged delegates \u2014 so-called \u2018superdelegates\u2019 \u2014 at the next convention. At the end of a three-hour conference call, which was opened to the public, the Rules and Bylaws Committee adopted a compromise that grew out of lengthy negotiations between supporters of\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign and supporters of Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u00a0(I-Vt.). In the past, superdelegates were able to vote on the first ballot at the convention, for any nominee. The new rule would prohibit superdelegates from voting until a second ballot, or in the event a candidate arrived at the convention with enough pledged delegates \u2014 earned in primaries and caucuses \u2014 to secure the nomination.\u201d Obama will hit the campaign trail -\u00a0CNBC:\u00a0\u201cFormer President\u00a0Barack Obamahas been laying low when it comes to taking on President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. That\u2019s not going to last much longer. The most high-profile member of the Democratic Party is expected to hit the campaign trail for House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates running in the midterm elections while getting guidance from House Minority Leader\u00a0Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, and Senate Minority Leader\u00a0Chuck Schumer, D-NY, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The timeline is fluid but the former president is expected to start making an impact in September\u2026\u201d FARM BILL GETS DELAYED IN THE SENATE\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cSenate leadership's goal of holding a floor vote on the farm bill this week is now in doubt, as key farm-state lawmakers work to resolve a new demand from Sen.\u00a0Marco Rubio\u00a0over a provision that would promote agricultural trade with Cuba. The Florida Republican on Wednesday declared on Twitter that he\u2019d block any new amendments to the farm bill unless the Senate votes to strike a provision that would allow USDA funding for foreign market development programs to be spent in Cuba \u2014 or until senators adopt his proposal to ban U.S. taxpayer dollars from being spent on businesses owned by the Cuban military. After a full day of debate on Wednesday, the Senate had only cleared a manager\u2019s package by unanimous consent that contains 18 mostly uncontroversial amendments, including new protections for pollinators and provisions that would increase funding for the milk donation program and raise the catastrophic coverage level under an insurance program for milk producers.\u201d The Judge\u2019s Ruling: Let\u2019s be constitutional -\u00a0This week, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge\u00a0Andrew Napolitano\u00a0ask if immigrants can be deported without a trial: \u201cThe forced separation by the government of children from their parents without a trial when neither is a danger to the other is child abuse or kidnapping or both.

PAPER, PLASTIC OR REPTILE?\u00a0Miami Herald:\u00a0\u201cA two-foot alligator didn't stroll into the Lakewood Ranch Wawa on its own earlier this month. Investigators have charged a 17-year-old boy they say grabbed the alligator from the wild and dropped it off inside the convenience store. At about 2:30 a.m. June 15, someone dropped off the gator at the Wawa at 14510 State Road 70 in Lakewood Ranch, according to the Manatee County Sheriff's Office. Deputies responded and called the Fish and Wildlife Commission, who sent a trapper out to the Wawa. The two-foot alligator was relocated to a suitable environment, according to FWC, and was not injured. On Friday, the teenager was issued a citation charging him with illegally possessing or harvesting an American alligator, a second-degree misdemeanor. The teen was not arrested but given notice to appear in court on July 21.\u201d AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201cIn a culture where everything from textbooks to television to SATs has been renormed and dumbed down, one should be grateful for an intellectual challenge.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Charles Krauthammer\u00a0writing in the Washington Post, Sept. 1, 2000.

            "article_content": "Rep. Duncan Hunter and his wife are fighting charges that they illegally used campaign funds for personal expenses; Hunter's Democratic opponent Ammar Campa-Najjar reacts on 'Your World.' California Democratic congressional candidate Ammar Campa-Najjar was barely on anyone\u2019s radar last week in his longshot bid against GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, in an overwhelmingly Republican district. But after Hunter\u2019s indictment Tuesday on corruption charges, including allegations of lavish personal spending with campaign funds, Campa-Najjar is suddenly a contender. With his boosted chances, though, has come scrutiny of his dark family past -- his grandfather was a member of the Palestinian Black September terror group that killed\u00a011 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. The 29-year-old political neophyte, who has both Mexican and Palestinian heritage, has been quick and unequivocal in separating himself from Muhammad Yusuf al-Najjar. Campa-Najjar is keen to point out he has never met his grandfather, whose death at the hands of Israeli commandos happened 16 years before Ammar was born. In a statement this week, the former Obama administration Labor Department official used his disavowal of his grandfather to take a not-so-subtle dig at his opponent. \"I'm happy to take responsibility for my own choices and my own decisions,\" he said. \"I think other men are responsible for their own crimes, whether it's somebody who I share a lineage with and nothing else, or a sitting congressman whose being indicted and could be facing serious charges in the future.\" His campaign also says while he\u2019s proud of his heritage, he is \u201cAmerican first.\u201d In an interview, Campa-Najjar told Fox News he isn\u2019t concerned that his family history could harm the campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned, but I think it shows Hunter is concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cMy opponents have to go back three generations to attack me. I can go back three days to highlight something pretty damning about him.\u201d REP. DUNCAN HUNTER PLEADS NOT GUILTY, CLAIMS INDICTMENT 'POLITICALLY MOTIVATED' Israeli media first drew attention to his family ties in early 2018, with\u00a0reports noting\u00a0he advocates a peaceful solution to the Middle East conflict -- unlike his grandfather. Hunter and his wife, meanwhile, pleaded not guilty to the charges against them on Thursday, and Hunter has declared the prosecution to be politically motivated. But with a lengthy list of personal spending totaling up to $250,000, Hunter has struggled to explain the charges. On Thursday, he was asked about spending by his wife, Margaret, and appeared to distance himself from her actions, saying it was her that handled the campaign finances. \"She was also the campaign manager, so whatever she did that'll be looked at too, I'm sure,\" Hunter told Fox News\u2019 Martha MacCallum. \"But I didn't do it. ... I didn't spend any money illegally.\" But even with Hunter's legal problems, Campa-Najjar faces a tough climb to victory. He picked up only 17.5 percent in the district\u2019s jungle primary and will need to convince a lot of Hunter voters to switch. Muhammad Yusuf al-Najjar (Getty Images) His website advocates for an eventual shift to 'Medicare for all,' a popular rallying cry on the left that may be a tough sell in this district. This week, liberal darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called Campa-Najjar her \"progressive brother.\" However, the candidate is not embracing hard-left rhetoric publicly and even criticized his party for ignoring Trump voters on Friday. \u201cThose Trump supporters who voted for him voted not because they're ignorant but because they've been ignored, by my party and by the country,\u201d he said. On immigration, while he does not back Trump\u2019s border wall and believes in a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, he supports tougher fines for employers who break immigration laws and does not support growing calls in his party to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He brushed off the question of whether he was a moderate or a left-wing progressive in the model of Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cI don\u2019t really care for labels, I've been labeled under the sun, and I\u2019m not one who really fits into anyone\u2019s label. I am who I am, I\u2019m comfortable in my skin and my views come via my life experiences,\u201d he said. Campa-Najjar, who is Christian, is the son of a Palestinian Muslim father (he spent part of his childhood in Gaza) and a Catholic Mexican-American mother. As for Hunter, he is careful not to go overboard in his criticism of his embattled opponent. Campa-Najjar repeatedly called Hunter a \u201chero\u201d for his service to the country in the Iraq War.

The breach of HealthCare.gov\u00a0comes two weeks before that start of the annual six-week enrollment period for health coverage, the Washington Post reported.

Consumers applying for health coverage have to provide personal information such as Social Security numbers, income and citizenship or immigration status. The thousands\u00a0of people affected by the breach make up a small share of the 8.7\u00a0million people who signed up for\u00a0this year's coverage. President Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act to no avail. In the meantime, his administration\u00a0has made efforts to weaken parts of the law.

            "article_content": "Secretary Alex Azar explains how the Trump administration plans to reduce the gap between what Americans spend and the international average on 'America's Newsroom.' Less than two weeks before the midterm elections, President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a plan that he said would stop unfair practices that force Americans to pay higher prices for prescriptions than people do for the same drugs in other countries. \u201cWe are taking aim at the global freeloading that forces American consumers to subsidize lower prices in foreign countries through higher prices in our country,\u201d Trump said during a brief speech at the Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cSame company. Same box. Same pill. Made in the exact same location, and you would go to some countries and it would be 20 percent of the cost of what we pay,\u201d said Trump, who predicted the plan will save Americans billions of dollars in drug costs. \u201cWe\u2019re fixing it.\u201d Trump has long promised sweeping action to attack drug prices, both as president and when he was running for the White House. He made his announcement just ahead of the Nov. 6 elections. Health care is high among voters\u2019 concerns. Under a proposal announced by the Department of Health and Human Services, payment for certain drugs administered in doctors\u2019 offices would shift to a level based on international prices. Drugmakers are sure to push back, arguing it would be tantamount to price controls. And Trump is linking the prices Americans complain about to one of his longstanding grievances: foreign countries the president says are taking advantage of U.S. research breakthroughs. The department says overall savings to U.S. programs like Medicare and to patients would total $17.2 billion over five years. The proposal is structured as an experiment and would apply to half the country. Officials said they\u2019re seeking input on how to select the areas of the country that will take part in the new pricing system. HHS Secretary Alex Azar said politics would have nothing to do with it. \u201cFor decades, other countries have rigged the system so American patients are charged much more \u2014 in some cases much, much more \u2014 for the exact same drug,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn other words, Americans pay more so other countries can pay less. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s unfair.\u201d In advance of his speech, HHS released a report that found U.S. prices for the top drugs administered in doctors\u2019 offices are nearly twice as high as in foreign countries. The list includes many cancer drugs. Medicare pays directly for them under its \u201cPart B\u201d coverage for outpatient care. Azar said Medicare spent about $8 billion more for drugs in the study than it would have if the prices were scaled to international prices. Azar said more plans were being developed to beat back the high cost of prescription drugs. \u201cThis is not the end of the road, the end of the journey,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is more coming.\u201d Any push to dramatically lower prices here would meet resistance not only from drugmakers but from doctors, two of the most powerful lobbies. Trump has harshly criticized the pharmaceutical industry, once asserting that the companies were \u201cgetting away with murder,\u201d a comment that sent pharmaceutical stocks tumbling. But it\u2019s largely been business as usual for drugmakers even as Trump has predicted \u201cmassive\u201d voluntary price cuts. A recent Associated Press analysis of prices for brand-name drugs found far more increases than cuts in the first seven months of this year. The analysis found 96 price hikes for every price cut. The number of increases slowed somewhat and they were not quite as steep as in past years, the AP found.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration calls for a Space Force to be established by 2020; Scott Kelly shares insight on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.' This is a rush transcript from \"The Story,\" August 9, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: And breaking tonight in New York, reports of newly uncovered e-mails paint a disturbing picture tonight of a Department of Justice official's bizarre ties to the author of the anti-Trump dossier. Raising new questions about why they were talking to each other at all? And what impact it had on triggering the Russia probe. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. Good to be back here in New York with you, tonight. The e-mails reportedly revealed that Christopher Steele was keeping in touch with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr as he was compiling the dossier. In fact, the two met several times during the dossier's creation. And at one point, as a sidebar, Steele was lobbying Ohr on behalf of a Russian oligarch trying to gain entry for him to the United States. So, if the name Bruce Ohr, sounds familiar as you followed this whole story with us along the way, it's because at the end of last year he was demoted at DOJ. Didn't lose his job, he was demoted amid an ongoing investigation into his contacts with Steele and Fusion GPS where his wife worked. Lots to dive into on that story tonight. Also this evening, the reportedly softening relationship between Rod Rosenstein and President Trump. And another intriguing story is Hope Hicks, coming back to the White House. We will get to all that. But first, we begin with Ed Henry, live at the White House with the backstory on the dossier bombshell. Good to see you tonight, Ed. ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Martha, great to see you. What a tangled web, web they were weaving. People associated with that opposition research firm, Fusing GPS that was hired by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC to dig up dirt on President Trump and Russia. It turns out that people associated with that firm were actually working to go to bat for a Russian oligarch. As you mentioned, at the middle of all this is that Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, he was in close contact with the former British Spy Christopher Steele who was putting together the dossier for Fusion GPS alleging that the president's team was colluding with the Russians. But as you noted this new correspondence obtained by The Hill newspaper, show Steele himself was lobbying Ohr to help the Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, get a visa. Now, Deripaska was blocked from traveling to the U.S. more than a decade ago because of suspected ties to Russian mob leaders. In February 2016, before the election, Steele e-mailed Ohr that the oligarch had gotten a visa and added, \"It would be helpful you could monitor it and let me know if any complications arise.\" Ohr at justice responded, \"To the extent I can, I will keep an eye on this situation.\" Significant in part because under questioning from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, earlier this year, the FBI director Christopher Wray testified he could only discuss that connection in a classified setting. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TOM COTTON, R-ARK., SENATE COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES: Do you know if Christopher Steele worked for Oleg Deripaska? CHRISTOPHER WRAY, DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: That's not something I can answer. (END VIDEO CLIP) HENRY: Now, remember as well that Ohr's wife Nellie, was on the payroll of Fusion GPS. Fox News contributor Byron York is reporting in The Washington Examiner that Ohr's log show, he and his wife met with Steele for breakfast on July 30th, 2016. Interesting timing Because Steele finishes different pieces of that dossier on July 19th and July 26th right before the breakfast. Then, right before the election on the morning of October 18th, Steele had pressing business with Bruce Ohr. E-mailing, \"If you're in Washington today, I have something quite urgent I would like to discuss with you preferably by Skype, even before work if you can.\" Now, Ohr said, they should connect right away. Steele wrote back, \"Thanks, Bruce. Two minutes.\" That same day, October 18th, Steele finished another installment of the dossier that went after former Trump campaign advisor Carter page for alleged ties to Russia. Then on October 19th and 20th, there were more installments of the dossier zeroing in on allegations against Paul Manafort. The bottom line is all these strands suggest that as the president has been tweeting in recent days that there may have been collusion or connections on the other side of all of this dealing with Russia that have simply not been investigated yet, Martha. MACCALLUM: Ed, thank you very much. So, here now with more on this Bryan Lanza, who is the former communications director for President Trump's transition team, he is now the managing director of mercury lobbying firm which currently does work for an independent board member of Oleg Deripaska's energy company. Also, tonight, joining me Mo Elleithee former Democratic National Committee spokesperson, and executive director of Georgetown Institute of Politics. And he is also a Fox News contributor. Gentlemen, welcome. Good to see both of you tonight. MO ELLEITHEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Mo, I want to start with you does that disturb you the story that Ed laid up? ELLEITHEE: I mean, look it is a convoluted story. And I don't really -- MACCALLUM: What's convoluted about it? ELLEITHEE: There's a lot of twists and turns in this thing, just as there has been with every step of this -- of this investigation from the beginning. So, are there questions to be asked? Sure. Should we look into them? Sure. Should we use this as an effort to discount the bigger investigation that's going on? Absolutely, not. I think -- you know -- MACCALLUM: But let me just ask you the basic -- one of the basic questions here which is does it concern you that a member of the Department of Justice who was a deputy to Rod Rosenstein or to Loretta Lynch at the time, does it disturb you that he would have had a constant talking relationship while Christopher Steele was doing the dossier, and his wife, meanwhile, was working for Fusion GPS who was also involved in putting together the dossier? Does that bother you? ELLEITHEE: My understanding is at the time, Christopher Steele was still on the -- on the FBI payroll. If my reading of the -- of the story in the sequence have advanced. MACCALLUM: No, I believe he had been fired by them. BRYAN LANZA, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP'S TRANSITION TEAM: Fire from lying and leaked. MACCALLUM: Yes, for leak -- leaking to the press. (CROSSTALK) ELLEITHEE: By at the time -- at the time of the -- at the -- my understanding is that the relationship went way back. Like I said, it's a -- its -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Well, the relationship goes all the way up to the election, because they're still talking before the election and in fact, right after. ELLEITHEE: Yes. So look, there's a lot of questions that I think are worth asking but I don't think it's going to be -- I think there got a lot of people that are going to try to use this as further -- in -- as further fuel to try to discredit the bigger investigation. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Understood. But wouldn't you want -- let me just stick with Mo for a second, and I'm going to get to Bryan. But wouldn't you want to know, if you -- if you're very interested as I assume you are, in whether or not there was collusion between either campaign in Russia. Then, the answer to these questions would be very important because the question that Senator Cotton asked was Oleg Deripaska paying Christopher Steele to work on his behalf? Now he is also someone who is suspected of potentially being one of the sources for the dossier. So, would you consider that a form of concern or potentially even something that might suggest that there was collusion? LANZA: Conspiracy? ELLEITHEE: I have -- I have always said, Martha, and you know that's having been on your show many, many times that I want investigation to play out. I want -- I want -- I want people to stop trying to shut down the investigation, and any questions that come of it regardless of what direction it goes. MACCALLUM: Right. ELLEITHEE: I think that's the difference between some of us and some on the other side that says we should just shut it all down. Let's let this thing play out and see where it takes us. MACCALLUM: OK. Now, Bryan, we need to clear up what you do. LANZA: All right. MACCALLUM: Because you used to be a Trump communications director, and now you're involved with a firm that is trying to help lift the sanctions against the firm that Oleg Deripaska, his Russian firm is working with, and involved with. But you're not representing him personally? Can you clear that up? LANZA: Correct. Yes, you'll basically what I do is I work for Lord Greg Barker, who's an independent board member of EN+, who's under sanctions, and EN+ is trying to shed along with the board member. You know, Lord Barker, were trying to shed Deripaska from the company's leadership, and from the company's board. MACCALLUM: So, if you can remove Deripaska from the company, then you're hoping that this company will get some sanctions relief. Is that true? LANZA: Correct. Well, is according to the sanctions that were listed, if those two things play -- if those two things take place, the U.S. government will lift sanctions. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: That it's possible is considered -- it to be considered. LANZA: Correct, yes. Well, that the benchmark that they said. MACCALLUM: Now, why would -- every -- you know, people at home visit, this story is very complicated, as Mo, said, and that is true, it is. Oleg Deripaska is not -- you know, somebody that most people are familiar with. So, he has obviously had some kind of relationship with Christopher Steele who put together the dossier. He also had some kind of relationship with Paul Manafort who was the campaign manager of the Trump campaign, I believe when you were there. LANZA: Correct. MACCALLUM: What do -- what do people need to understand about this guy? LANZA: You know, I don't know a lot about him. You know, what I do know is that -- you know, his relationship with Chris Steele brings a lot of cause and concern. I mean, if you look at what the Clinton campaign did, they hired a foreign agent in Chris Steele to make contacts with his Russian government contacts, and his Russian friends, which is Oleg Deripaska and the Russian government. I mean, that gives me concern because that's his interference. That says conspiracy to interfere in an American election by foreign agents, A, you know, this British national, and B, you know these Russian officials that he claimed to get this information from. And to and to -- you know, put descent. And so, descent inside our -- inside our political arena. And I think that's -- that should cause a lot of people concerned, and I do what to get -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: But you also had a relationship with Paul Manafort who was the campaign manager. LANZA: Sure. I mean, what his relationship with Paul is his relations. I have no -- I have no context or any idea what their relationship is. MACCALLUM: This guy's obviously had his hand in a lot of different pots on both sides of the fence. LANZA: Absolutely. MACCALLUM: And we need to learn a lot more about that. Let me just swing forward to a couple of other quick topics here. Rod Rosenstein and the president, Mo. Apparently, there's been a softening in that relationship, their reports are that they talked several times a week. What do you make of that and is that significant? ELLEITHEE: Well, I -- look, if the president is going to stop trying to get Rod Rosenstein fire, or talking about that, that's a good thing -- that's a good thing. Look, I think it shows how transactional the president is when Rod Rosenstein gives him -- does things that he likes, he will praise him. When he does things that he doesn't like, like not shutting down this investigation, he goes after him. I mean, just this morning, he went after once again the witch hunt. The witch hunt that, that Rod Rosenstein is apparently -- you know -- you know, not shutting down for. And so, so, I think it's a transactional thing but if there's a slowing down of the war on Rosenstein and the DOJ, then that's a good thing. MACCALLUM: Yes, Bryan, there's a report that the White House is not in favor of the Republican leaders in the House who are trying to subpoena Rod Rosenstein. That they -- you know, that perhaps, they're discouraging that and sort of having a better relationship with him, as I said. LANZA: You know, I think, if you -- look, like the president has always said, he wants this investigation to go forward, he's made the staff available to answer as many questions as possible, they turned in over millions of documents. I think, what the president wants is a speedy resolution to this investigation. And his frustration with the Deputy Attorney General is that he feels the process isn't going fast enough. I mean, from our perspective, you know, you've interviewed everybody, you've reviewed all the documents, you see everybody's e-mails, you know, let's come to a resolution. I think you hear it Mayor Rudy Giuliani talking about this thing being resolved soon. I think we've had enough time when you people have seen enough underneath all these rocks to come up with the conclusion and let's get there already. MACCALLUM: Just a few seconds left, Bryan, and the questions for you, Hope Hicks, do you expect that she will rejoin the Trump campaign or the Trump White House in either capacity? ELLEITHEE: You know, I think the White House and the campaign would be lucky to have her. You know, somebody who worked alongside, Hope, I think she's a -- she's an added value to any organization she's going to be a part of. Specifically, this administration with her understanding of the president and how he views the media. It's -- it was a loss when she left, and if in when she returns, it will be a tremendous gain for this administration in campaign. MACCALLUM: Yes. Reports are that she has been talking to a lot of high- level operations, you know, some on Wall Street, and some in other places in New York City that would like to have her, probably work for them, as well. So we'll see what happens with that. LANZA: She'll succeed at anything she touches. MACCALLUM: Bryan Lanza, thank you. Mo Elleithee, thank you very much. Good to see you both, gentlemen. ELLEITHEE: Thanks. LANZA: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So, how about this, the president's plan to create a space force. Former NASA astronaut and International Space Station Commander Scott Kelly joins me next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT: We will take the first bold steps to ensure our security on earth and in outer space with renewed American strength. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PENCE: The time has come to write to the next great chapter in the history of our armed forces, to prepare for the next battlefield, where America's best and bravest will be called to deter and defeat a new generation of threats to our people, to our nation. The time has come to establish the United States Space Force. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That was Vice President Pence today at the Pentagon moving a step closer to the reality of a U.S. Space Force by the year 2020 which is right around the corner. The Vice President describing it as the sixth branch of the military that would defend against space-related national security risk including attacks on American GPS and communication satellites. Joining me now is Scott Kelly, former fighter pilot, astronaut, and Commander of the International Space Station who once set the American record for the total number of days in space. Scott, great to have you here. Thank you very much for being here tonight. So explain to me what your take is on this. The President obviously is passionate about this idea. He's talked about it a lot. He says he doesn't want us to fall behind China or Russia when it comes to potential warfare of any kind, cyber or otherwise in space. SCOTT KELLY, FORMER COMMANDER, INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION: Well, I think that is a good idea not falling behind. You know, I also think we currently have a great capability within the U.S. military in the U.S. Air Force and you know adding another layer of government bureaucracy to the tune of $8 billion initially is probably not a good use of our taxpayer dollars. MACCALLUM: So tell me a little bit about how -- you're saying we this already exists. How does it exist? There's -- the Air Force has what's called Space Command within it right and I think there's about 30,000 people that work on that. Is it possible that what they're considering is you know, sort of dividing them off and creating their own branch so that there's not redundancy? KELLY: Well, we used to have a something called a Space Command and in 2002, it was put back into the Air Force because it wasn't working like they expected it to. And now we're talking about something much larger, something much more expensive, an independent capability outside of the other branches of the service to operate and for me when this was mentioned it was all kind of a head-scratcher. MACCALLUM: So you know, in terms of -- I was listening to another former astronaut earlier today who was talking about you know, being prepared for the future and looking at the future of warfare and I think about you know, all of the sort of science-fiction ideas that we see in many ways, some of them playing out. You think about drones you know, I think about some of even you know superheroes like Ironman and then you look at some of the new military uniforms and creations to protect people that are similar to those kinds of things. So don't we need to be thinking about potentially a future where there might be that kind of warfare? KELLY: Absolutely. And we usually have experts that get together and discuss these things and panels and you know not just one person saying we should have a new branch of the military. It just to me doesn't it's not logical. MACCALLUM: It sounds like what bothers you is that the President's like sort of just put it out there which he just want to do at times. KELLY: And then you know, that was you know, a little bit troublesome. And then today to see that his campaign is going to sell Space Force swag, I mean, to me that tells you pretty much what the reason behind this was is that it's political. You know, it's not a capability that the leaders in our country the military -- MACCALLUM: But like talking to you because you know, I mean I get that you don't -- you don't want to add bureaucracy, that's what I'm hearing. You don't want to grow the size of our of our military unnecessarily. I think everybody can agree with that. But in terms of the need for something to you know, combat what has been described as you know North Korea, Iran, Russia, all pursuing weapons to jam and blind and disabled our navigation and communication satellites via electronic attacks from the ground, is there a need for us to be more advanced in these ways? KELLY: Absolutely. MACCALLUM: So what's wrong with making it the Space Force? KELLY: Because we already have it. We already have the U.S. Air Force that has the bureaucracy built into it that we don't have to add a new bureaucracy that does most of what we're talking about already. MACCALLUM: What do you think is the biggest threat that would be considered part of what either branch could do? KELLY: You know, my concern is you know, we're the leader of the free world and as soon as we say hey we're going to have this new branch of the military, we're going to weaponize space, it's really easy when you have a country that can put a satellite into low-earth orbit for them to do damage to the space environment, very, very simple. You know, if you can launch the satellite into space, you can launch a lot of space debris that can you know garbage up the environment for the future and I think our country needs to set the example. And we already have a very good capability with the U.S. Air Force and to be spending initially $8 billion on something we sort of already have -- MACCALLUM: So are we able to adequately protect our satellite systems and our GPS systems and in terms of cyber warfare, you think we can adequately do that already? KELLY: I think if we couldn't, then leaders in our country and leaders in the military for the last you know, 25 years -- I was in the Navy for 25 years -- 20 at NASA, I never heard anyone say we need a new branch of the Armed Services to protect against these kinds of threats because we currently have that. MACCALLUM: All right, Scott Kelly, good to see you, sir. Thank you very much for serving our country in space and on the ground. Good to see you. Thank you very much. All right, coming up tonight, CNN's White House Reporter Jim Acosta said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM ACOSTA, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN: And we're not supposed to be the story. You know, that's not why I'm out there. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Our Wall Street Journal panel joins us in a moment. Mary O'Grady, Dan Henninger, and Shelby Holliday all here coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So depending on whom you ask, this week's primary is -- were great signs for either Democrats or the grand old party. So which is it? Karl Rove in The Wall Street Journal today just like a page apart, he wrote the Blue Wave may be receiving. Tuesday's elections show that the GOP has a fighting chance to keep the House. But then you turn the page and the Journal's editorial board disagrees writing \"the red wave illusion evidence builds of major GOP losses in November.\" So who is right? Who better to bring in than Mary O'Grady Wall Street Journal Editorial Board Member, Daniel Henninger, the Deputy Editor of the Editorial Page and a Fox News Contributor and Shelby Holliday is the Journal's Senior Video Reporter. Great to have all of you here. MARY O'GRADY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Good to be here. MACCALLUM: Let me start in the middle. Dan, which is it? DANIEL HENNINGER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I would say it sounds like a surfing contest doesn't it. And if the Republicans are looking for a red wave, I think they're still out there paddling away. I mean, let's start with the baseline. Ohio 12, Troy Balderson should have won by a lot more than he did. He ended up in a virtual dead heat in a heavily weighted Republican district. Most of the remaining Republican seats that are competitive are much less heavily Republican than Ohio 12. Then you go out to Washington State where Cathy McMorris Rodgers runs from a district that Trump carried by 12 points, she didn't get above 50 percent in the jungle primary. These are not good signs for the Republicans, Martha. And if something is going on out there in these suburban districts that is siphoning votes away from the Republicans. MACCALLUM: What is it? O'GRADY: Well, I agree that neither one of those were we're good for the Republicans. However, I would say that first of all you have to remember that in Midterms, the incumbent is not favored so you know they are automatically are going at a disadvantage. But add on to the fact that turnout really matters here. And the Republican turnout was not there, it was an August primary an August election in Ohio. There was not a good Republican turnout so it's possible you get a better turnout when you come to November because people are actually waiting for the election. But I agree with them I think it's a bad signal because I think that you know so much of what Trump depends on is that independent voter that's really not part of his base but is voting for a Republican because they don't like Hillary. MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean, you look at the Democratic rural voter as someone who crossed over and voted for Trump in many cases in places like western Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan, and then you look at the you know, the GOP voter who came out in ways that they didn't before for President Trump. His numbers are good. I wonder if people aren't paying attention really until after Labor Day perhaps, Shelby. SHELBY HOLLIDAY, SENIOR VIDEO REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: That might be the case. I mean, I'm also reminded of Georgia Sixth District. I was down there and that was an interesting -- that was high turnout. There was a lot of enthusiasm among the Democrats but also Republican suburban moms who didn't really love the messaging coming out of the White House and they decided they were going to vote for Jon Ossoff. He was a young candidate, he was pretty fiscally moderate so he appealed to Republicans. That could be a recipe for Democrats but it doesn't look like that's the way Democrats are going in the way of the Midterms. It looks like they're heading more left. That could be a problem and I think ultimately yes, while these races are very tight, Republicans are still winning them. MACCALLUM: Interesting. I mean, you know, Bernie Sanders backed some candidates who didn't do that well. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is sort of the sweetheart of the progressive movement right now, this Democratic Socialist Movement. Here she is sort of backing up her ideas on CNN. It was last night -- it was last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK: We write unlimited blank checks for war, we write a two -- we just wrote a $2 trillion check for that tax cut, the GOP tax cut, and nobody asks those folks how are they going to pay for it. We only have empty pockets when it comes to the morally right things to do but when it comes to tax cuts for billionaires and when it comes to unlimited war, we seem to be able to be to invent that number -- that money very easily. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Socialism and inventing money. O'GRADY: She could run under a banner that says why can't everything be free, you know. MACCALLUM: But it's not free. That's the problem, right? O'GRADY: I mean, that's her speech is basically that everything should be free and if it's not free it's because somehow the establishment is keeping people from it. It's preposterous and I don't think it's so surprising that you have a person like this but it is surprising that you have people voting for her, buying into that. I mean, the Medicare for all idea that she has would cost something north of $32 trillion for the next decade. It's simply not affordable when you make things free for everyone, demand will always outstrip supply. MACCALLUM: All right. Let's turn to the media. Jim Acosta has -- I don't think -- I think a lot of people didn't know Jim Acosta's name before he became a reporter covering the White House for CNN during the Trump White House. Here he is talking about his perspective on journalism and on covering the president, and the importance of all of that in covering politics with Stephen Colbert last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN COLBERT, COMEDIAN: Do you worry that the president points at you all so much and that there's a natural need to respond as a human being that you end up being the story when that's not really the goal of your journalism? JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Right. And we're not supposed to be the story. You know, that's not why I'm out there, you know, I get accused of that from time to time. And my attitude is, listen, I'm allowed to care about this country just as much as anybody else. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Dan? DANIEL HENNINGER, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: If he is not part of the story, what's he doing on Colbert sitting like a celebrity? I mean, I think what happened here, Martha, is that a lot of the, to be sure, Trump took it to these journalists, he has attacked the press, he has attacked the media. That's his modus operandi. He did that to the people he was running against in the Republican primaries, they lost it. And I think some of these journalists have lost it as well. Look, if you ascend to your -- to the point in American journalists and the press where you are a White House reporter, you have to have enough professional self-discipline not to start wearing your heart on your sleeve in front of these press conferences. And some of the questions Jim Acosta they are questions. They are statements and assertions to Sarah Sanders. MACCALLUM: Let's take a look at some of those. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ACOSTA: Mr. President, will you stop calling us the enemy of the people, sir? Will you stop calling the press the enemy of the people, sir? The president of the United States should not refer to us as the enemy of the people and all I'm asking you to do, sir, is to acknowledge that right now and right here. Maybe we should go out. All journalists should go on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people, because I'm tired of this, honestly, Brooke. I'm tired of this. It is not right, it is not fair, it is not just. (END VIDEO CLIP) O'GRADY: Well, you know, a reporter, I think is down to us, a reporter has a responsibility to report the story and not to get his own personal views in it. He's not an opinion writer, if he wants to write opinion he should change jobs. MACCALLUM: I always think of Dorothy (Ph), who also went to tell me when I -- years ago when I work to the journal that, you know, in the old days, you know, reporters didn't have bylines. HENNINGER: Right. MACCALLUM: Right? It wasn't until that, I mean, that long ago that reporters didn't had bylines because it was never about them. It's supposed to be about them. It's supposed to be about reporting the story. And really when you are doing a good job of it, your reporting is what speaks, not your voice and not your, you know, personality and you becoming a minor celebrity. (CROSSTALK) O'GRADY: Right. It's also not good for the news organization. MACCALLUM: Yes. O'GRADY: One of the things that's going on here is that it's eroding the trust of the audience because they don't know if the news they are getting is just being filtered through his own-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Well, he even said after the president-- (CROSSTALK) SHELBY HOLLIDAY, REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, the issue is that the viewers at that point sort of are forced to take aside. It's become a battle and it's one versus the other. I'm all for reporters asking tough questions. (CROSSTALK) O'GRADY: Absolutely. HOLLIDAY: But when you make it that combative, you have to wonder is it productive? Because reporters in the White House press briefing room are there to get answers. MACCALLUM: Is the president at fault at all though? Because that's what Acosta would say. HOLLIDAY: Well, there are two sides to the story. But it's not productive for journalism. HENNINGER: The president has -- no question about it. MACCALLUM: Yes. HENNINGER: He's calling them the enemies of the people. But if you have a fight at a newspaper, you let the publisher handle it or you let the people running the network. The reporters on the beat in the White House press room are not the ones who should be taking the battle to the president. MACCALLUM: Mary, Dan, Shelby, great to see you all. Thank you very much. O'GRADY: Great to be here. MACCALLUM: So she was forced out of Iran for speaking against the mullahs, now they have made her family come out in Iran and publicly condemn her. She has a message for President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MASIH ALINEJAD, IRANIAN ACTIVIST: So, we, the women of Iran, breaking the laws every day to just be ourselves and I'm a master criminal. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, as President Trump issues warnings to countries doing business with Iran and snaps back the sanctions on the brutal regime, one brave activist is speaking out. Describing how Iran is trying to destroy her family. Masih Alinejad was threatened just for writing about women's rights and against the rules imposed by the regime. Eventually she was forced to leave her homeland and she is here next in a story exclusive tonight. But first Trace Gallagher live in our west coast newsroom gives us the back story. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. Even when she lived in Iran, Masih Alinejad says as a journalist she was highly critical of her country's leaders routinely calling out then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his regime for mismanagement and corruption. In the New York Times, Alinejad writes that she was often threatened and intimidated when until finally her press credentials were revoked. In 2009, she fled her homeland first to the U.K., then to the U.S. but her anti- Iranian stance remained steady. In 2014 she began a campaign against Iran's laws forcing women to wear hijabs or veils and even though she was out of the regime's reach her activism resulted in threats against her family and their livelihoods. She says on the Iranian version of 60 Minutes, her sister seen here, disowned her, saying that Masih had crossed a red line when she publicly challenged the Iran supreme leader. But despite being threatened, exiled, and ostracized, the Guardian writes that Masih is, quote, \"fun, noisy, and opinionated and worst of all, for the people who run her country, unafraid.\" Here's Alinejad in 2016 at the Women in the World New York summit. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALINEJAD: So, we, the women of Iran breaking the laws every day to just be ourselves. And I'm a master criminal, why? Because the government of Iran thinks that I have too much hair, I have too much voice and I'm have too much of a woman. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: She recalls that before the Iranian Revolution in 1979 women were equals, they could play sports, go to the gym, there were even female judges. She says her parent's support of the revolution because they were poor and thought it would lead to better jobs, it did not. A decade after leaving Iran, Alinejad has millions of followers on Facebook, but her parents still don't have the internet. She says she talks to her mom every few weeks but doesn't know if she will ever see her family again. She says Iran is like her childhood backyard, dark. And so her plea to women there is to open their eyes wide to make the darkness disappear. Martha? MACCALLUM: Thank you very much, Trace. Here now, Masih Alinejad, Iranian activist and author of \"The Wind in my Hair\" which you say is illegal to feel the wind in your hair in Iran. ALINEJAD: It's a crime to feel the wind in your hair. But I want to say that actually we are fighting against the philosophy behind hijab, we are fighting for choice for, you know, freedom to choose what we want to wear. But this I mean, for probably who doesn't know that we are actually not fighting against this small piece of cloth. We are changeling the main foundational block of the Islamic republic of Iran. We are challenging one of the main pillars of the Islamic. That is why actually they are really scared of us and the campaign that I, you know, have in Iran and that is why they brought my family in Iranian TV to disowned me publicly. MACCALLUM: What did your sister -- I saw that you reacted when you see that video of your sister, what goes through you and what did you she say about you? ALINEJAD: You know, because I haven't seen them for nine years and that was actually the first time that I saw my sister's face. I wanted to just turn off the audio and see, you know, my sister's face. That's all. But the thing is, you know, they brought my sister on TV to break me because I'm out of their reach. And they know that through my campaign, the millions of Iranian women are, you know, breaking the law every day and showing their civil disobedience. Rich men, especially the Islamic republic officials they are really scared of strong women, and now women in Iran they are leading the movement. The movement gaining momentum. MACCALLUM: You start a movement called White Wednesdays. ALINEJAD: Yes, yes. MACCALLUM: Tell everybody what that is. ALINEJAD: Yes. White Wednesday is a peaceful movement where women take off their headscarves and walking in public which is a punishable crime to challenge the Islamic republic of Iran. And because there is that Iran protest taking place in Iran right now, and women are in front. That scares the government. So that is why, you know, they didn't want to break me, they wanted to break the women who were actually there inside Iran and they dare to challenge the Islamic republic of Iran. That was their goal. MACCALLUM: I mean, it's extraordinary when you think about the changes, and you talk about the changes since 1979, I mean, this was a very forward, highly educated, sophisticated culture. ALINEJAD: Yes. MACCALLUM: And when the mullahs came in and cracked down, they took all of that freedom away from all of you. Do you think we are at a moment now where that could change again? Could the reverse of 1979 happen in Iran? ALINEJAD: Let me tell you something. The revolution itself became the revolution against women. Each woman in Iran if they want to have freedom they have to start their own revolution, which, you know, I did. I started my own revolution from my family's kitchen. Before the revolution we have female singers. Women were allowed to, you know, participate in any kind of sports that they want, we had the freedom of choice. We want -- we were allowed to choose what we wanted to wear. Women -- we had judges, you know. We had ministers, we had all of the social freedom. But right now, women, they have to fight for their basic rights but they still have more than 60 percent of university. We occupy the university places. But this is the government actually count of like second class citizen. But I have hope, I'm not hopeless because every individual woman they became their own, you know, leader. They are not waiting for anyone to come and save them, to come and rescue them. They are the warriors instead of being like victim. MACCALLUM: I want to play a sound bite from President Trump and get your thoughts on what he says here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want to deliver a message to the long-suffering people of Iran. The people of America stand with you, the future of Iran belongs to its people. They are the rightful heirs of a rich culture and an ancient land. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What is your message to President Trump, how can he and his administration and Americans help you in your cause? ALINEJAD: Look, I am a woman rights activist. What is important for me is human rights. And Donald Trump actually said that he is going to support the people of Iran. First, I want him to remove the Iranian people from travel ban. MACCALLUM: OK. ALINEJAD: Because sanctions hurt the Iranian people. I want him to sanction the officials who oppressed people, who kill people, who torture people to death. I want him to ban, you know, the Islamic republic officials and their children who are here in America because these are the troublemakers. I want him to ban and, you know, sanction the Islamic republic main propaganda tool. The Iranian television, the Revolutionary Guard because people are suffering from lack of electricity, lack of water. They took the street of Iran like 18 states in Iran and they are chanting against the whole regime and now this sanction is hurting the people. MACCALLUM: I'm almost out of time. I could talk to you for hours. But you know, in terms of the money, right, from the Iran deal, and where ended up going and supporting these different, you know, military adventurism against Gaza and Syria and elsewhere. (CROSSTALK) ALINEJAD: That is why the people are in the street. They are asking where the money go. MACCALLUM: But is that powerful enough to tip the balance? Are we at a tipping point potentially do you think? ALINEJAD: I strongly believe that. When Donald Trump comes, you know, first threatening Iran with military action and then said that I can have negotiation, I want to say that if you are going to sit down with the Iranian government and then they accept and come out with a deal, nuclear deal, then everybody is going to forget about human rights? This is what actually the European Union did. Before, you know, the member of the European Union going to Iran for during the talk they said that we want to meet the human rights activist. But after the deal, they totally ignored human rights. This is what has been missing and Donald Trump actually missed a great opportunity. Right now, he could, you know, ban the Islamic officials, he could sanction the Revolutionary Guard and that is the way you care about human rights. MACCALLUM: We will see. Thank you very much, Masih and good to meet you. ALINEJAD: Thank you so much for having me. MACCALLUM: The book is called \"The Wind in my Hair, My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran.\" Coming up next, Defense Secretary James Mattis once said be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet. But his real thoughts on war and on people may come as an even bigger shock. Jim Proser is here with an in-depth and unknown back story of the renowned general, coming up next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What keeps you awake at night? JAMES MATTIS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Nothing. I keep other people awake at night. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: It is true that there are very few people in America today who are more admired than Defense Secretary James 'Mad Dog' as his nickname is known, Mattis. A marine who served more than four decades in the military, only to continue serving his country as the first confirmed member of President Trump's cabinet with a vote of 98 to 1. In an extremely polarized Senate and environment, we've all seen what happened with the judges, that did not happen with General Mattis. So what is the real secret to this man? To understanding General Mattis. With an answer to that, Jim Proser, author of \"No Better Friend, No Worse Enemy: The Life of General James Mattis.\" Why the title, Jim, straight there? JIM PROSER, AUTHOR, NO BETTER FRIEND, NO WORSE ENEMY: Well, he adapted that from the Roman emperor and commander Lucius Sulla. And it typifies his ability to be both a competent war fighter and a compassionate peacemaker. MACCALLUM: So yu talk about that a lot that he is obviously, he is a very scholarly individual. PROSER: Right. MACCALLUM: He is an extremely educated man, extraordinarily smart and knows his history-- PROSER: Right. MACCALLUM: -- inside and out. And that informs his feelings of compassion- - PROSER: Yes. MACCALLUM: -- in war as well as his commitment to results. PROSER: Yes. MACCALLUM: To winning. PROSER: Yes. Well, he studied war, he is a student of war but in that study he understood that the purpose of war is to win the hearts and minds of the people. So he has always made very clear to the marines under his command that the people are the prize and that as he likes to say, there's a, be polite, be professional, but be prepared to kill everyone you meet. MACCALLUM: You know, in the beginning of the book you talk about a Christmas night when he was on duty and they expected that he wouldn't be on duty because of the Christmas night and one of the reasons that he's able to do that is that he walked away from the most significant relationship in his life with his fiance Alice. PROSER: Yes. MACCALLUM: Who he left before they got married. What's the significance of Alice to understanding General Mattis? PROSER: Well, I think he recognized at that point that there was his level of commitment to the Marine Corps and to the nation would preclude a full and complete marriage. And the woman he loved recognized that. And I think he came to agree with that. And so he assume marriage for then a life of leading his marines. MACCALLUM: You know, it's remarkable, you know, his commitment. What about his relationship with the president? PROSER: Well, James Mattis I think is living proof that Donald Trump is neither unethical nor incompetent. If he were, he wouldn't spend 10 minutes in the same room, General Mattis wouldn't. So I think people can be reassured that they are in good hands with General Mattis. And he wouldn't even -- he doesn't seek the spotlight, so he wouldn't bring out any disagreements with the commander-in-chief but he also wouldn't serve any one who was not up to the job. MACCALLUM: Very interesting. It's a great book. \"No Better Friend, No Worse Enemy: The Life of General James Mattis.\" Fantastic insight. Jim Proser, thank you very much. PROSER: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Good to have you here tonight. PROSER: I appreciate it. MACCALLUM: We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So that's The Story on this Thursday night. Good to have you with us tonight. I will see you tomorrow night. I'll be live in Washington, D.C. I will also be making a special appearance with Guy Benson on his radio show tomorrow night around 5 o'clock from Washington, D.C., as well. Have a great night, everybody. Tucker Carlson is up next.

A former National Teacher of the Year recipient, Hayes defeated a veteran politician in the primary. (John Woike/Hartford Courant via AP) From public housing to a teen pregnancy, Jahana Hayes' journey to become the Democratic nominee for Congress in Connecticut has been anything but easy. Hayes, a 2016 National Teacher of the Year recipient, soundly beat Simsbury First Selectman Mary Glassman, a two-time candidate for lieutenant governor, in the Aug. 14 primary in the 5th district. She will face Republican Manny Santos, former mayor of Meriden, in November. If she wins, Hayes will make history as the first black woman to win a Connecticut congressional seat\u00a0as well as the first black congresswoman from New England. \u201cWhen we started this campaign a little more than 100 days ago, we had no organization and no network,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cPeople told us we had no chance and no business trying to upset the status quo. And tonight, we proved them wrong.\u201d Hayes already has a fundraising advantage, as she had about $360,000 cash on hand by July 25. Santos, on the other hand, had less than $500 after accounting for a campaign debt. The seat opened up this year after Rep. Elizabeth Esty, who was heavily criticized for her handling of a sexual harassment case in her office, declined to run for re-election. Read on for a look at three things to know about Hayes. President Barack Obama awarded Jahana Hayes the 2016 National Teacher of the Year award. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Former President Barack Obama gave Hayes the 2016 National Teacher of the Year award. Then, Hayes taught social studies at John F. Kennedy High School in Waterbury, Connecticut. \u201cI really think that we need to change the narrative, change the dialogue about what teaching is as a profession,\u201d Hayes told The Washington Post at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the last few years talking about the things that are not working. We really need to shift our attention to all the things that are working.\u201d FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTION HEADQUARTERS She told Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show in 2016 that she \u201cteaches kindness\u201d and community service in her classroom. Hayes attended Naugatuck Valley Community College before earning a degree at Southern Connecticut State University. She later earned her masters and advanced degrees from the University of Saint Joseph and the University of Bridgeport, according to her campaign website. A lifelong resident of Connecticut, Hayes grew up in an environment that she said was \u201cillustrated by the predictable cycle of poverty.\" Hayes lived in public housing and her family members struggled with addiction, she described on her campaign website. And once, she said, her family lost their apartment. As a teenager, Hayes became pregnant and she thought \u201call hopes for any upward mobility seemed beyond \u2026 grasp,\u201d according to her campaign website. But those in her community encouraged her to keep pushing for an education. WHO IS SHARICE DAVIDS, THE KANSAS CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE WHO COULD MAKE HISTORY? In her application for National Teacher of the Year, Hayes explained how her upbringing helped shape her. \u201cAs a child growing up in an urban poverty-stricken environment, I only came in contact with one minority teacher. This contact greatly influenced the person I became,\u201d she said, according to The Washington Post. The story of her upbringing was integral to her campaign message, according to the Hartford Courant. Jahana Hayes was endorsed by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. (AP Photo/Reuters) During her acceptance speech, Hayes vowed to \u201cfight for the soul of our nation\u201d and called for single-payer health care, stronger gun laws and an educational system that provides greater opportunities for all children. On her campaign website, she said she supports universal background checks for all firearm purchases and the directing of money to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to look into gun violence \u201cas a public health issue.\u201d She said she also supports a \u201cfederal assault weapons ban to keep weapons of war off our streets.\u201d MEET RASHIDA TLAIB, WHO IS POISED TO BECOME THE FIRST MUSLIM WOMAN ELECTED TO CONGRESS She\u2019s been endorsed by Sen. Kamala Harris and had support from the Connecticut Working Families Party chapter (CTWFP) and unions. \u201cHer victory tonight speaks to Democratic voters\u2019 strong desire for a champion they can trust to take on [President] Trump and corporate special interests without compromise,\u201d CTWFP state director Lindsay Farrell said in a statement. \u201cJahana\u2019s win also demonstrates the value in electing and mobilizing teachers who will fight for public education, stand up to [Education Secretary] Betsy DeVos, and advocate the importance of collective bargaining,\u201d Farrell continued. \u201cThrough Jahana\u2019s campaign, we have seen an outpouring of support from parents, students, and fellow teachers inspired by Jahana\u2019s story.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" August 9, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Morgan Ortagus, Geraldo Rivera, Jason Chaffetz, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" The RNC is trolling Democrats for appearing to come up short in Ohio's 12th district special election, a race that's still too close to call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Close, in Ohio 12 but no cigar, at least not yet. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: This is a moral victory for the Democrats. The fact that they're this close is a moral victory for the Democrats. You want a real victory. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: We get some mojos, all right. So, I don't know if it's a moral victory or whatever. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Moral victory. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Moral victory. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Moral victory. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Moral victory is not get you an office in Washington. (END VIDEO CLIPS) PERINO: Karl Rove reacting to the election result by saying the blue wave could be receding and Republicans have a fighting chance to keep the house majority. This comes as more Democrats are distancing themselves from party leader Nancy Pelosi. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Would you back Pelosi for speaker if you win and are in the house? ALEXADRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think -- again, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, as you've mentioned. I've got to win my race first. But we've got to take a look at what's going on. We've got to take a look at in winning the house back in November. And then once the house is won, we have to make that decision from there. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: We'll you vote for Nancy Pelosi? RASHIDA TLAIB, MICHIGAN CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Probably not. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Probably not. TLAIB: That's my answer. No, probably not. She doesn't speak about the issues that are important to the families of the 13th congressional district. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right. Jason, Nancy Pelosi has got a lot of high tolerance for this kind of thing. She doesn't ever get in the middle. She just lets them say what they want because she wants to win. JASON CHAFFETZ, GUEST CO-HOST: Oh, she's keeping track. PERINO: She's keeping track, but she keeps quiet. CHAFFETZ: She's got a tally. Don't be fooling anybody. And you know what? It is a legitimate question because it's the very first thing you do as a new member of congress. You have to go in front of the entire body and call out who is it you're going to vote for. The reality is the Democrats -- they lack leadership. I don't think they have the right policies. And to the point of the peace beforehand, I don't think there is some big wave that's coming from the Democrats. I sat there in 2010, the year after -- the election after Barack Obama, they took -- I think it was a net of 63 seats that switched hands and there was this big tsunami, and I don't see any evidence of it happening. PERINO: All right. I was so excited to talk politics. I didn't do what I meant to do, which is to introduce Morgan. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah, nice work. PERINO: . to all of you and to the audience. I'm very rude. I'm known for that, really, for being very rude. Morgan, welcome. MORGAN ORTAGUS, GUEST CO-HOST: Thank you. PERINO: Tell us a little about yourself. Where you're from? ORTAGUS: I'm thrilled to be here. I've been watching this show for ages, so happy to be here. I live in New York City, but I'm from Florida. I am in the U.S. Navy reserves. I've been stationed as a civilian in Saudi Arabia at the U.S. embassy there, and in Baghdad. I think we've got some fun pictures of me looking like a dork in my Kevlar. (CROSSTALK) ORTAGUS: That's a very graceful picture of me in the Saudi Arabian desert. That's a classic. And this is me getting promoted a couple years ago. GUTFELD: Anchors away. Congratulations. ORTAGUS: And one of my favorite things, I'm an identical twin. I will give all of you $10 if you can guess which one is me. PERINO: You're on the left. GUTFELD: Wait, she looks totally different. (CROSSTALK) CHAFFETZ: You are not wearing those glasses. That is not you in the glasses. (CROSSTALK) ORTAGUS: I've moved to New York in 2006 to work on K.T. McFarland's Senate race as her press secretary. Ed Rollins brought me to New York and I literally lived with K.T., so it's very infectious here on Fox News with all of the connection. PERINO: That is true. Also, you have another thing, you said you and grandfather use to... ORTAGUS: I said before the show that I love Geraldo because I grew up with my grandfather watching cable news. But we've watch the first Iraq war with you reporting from both Iraq wars, actually. And -- GERALDO RIVERA, CO-HOST: 1991. ORTAGUS: . I'm a big fan. RIVERA: I used to get, you know, all the pretty girls saying, oh, I love you, Geraldo. Then the pretty girls would say, oh, my mother loves you, Geraldo. But now the pretty girls say, oh, my grandmother loves you, Geraldo. (LAUGHTER) ORTAGUS: No, it's nostalgic. It's very good. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Greg, like all the older ladies love you. GUTFELD: I'm like the sun they allow to get away with saying really awful things. PERINO: That's true. GUTFELD: Like they would punish me if I was there kid, but they just treat me like, oh, he doesn't really mean that. PERINO: Morgan, welcome to you. Would you like to comment on the state of the midterms? ORTAGUS: So, it was interesting to me, I was listening to what they were saying, moral victory, moral victory, and I thought moral victory is like the new liberal version of participation trophy. Like, you know, when you're a kid -- I'm the resident millennial on the panel. So we're millennial, you know, we were kids we get participation trophies and we didn't knew -- do well. So, I think, as long as they want to keep saying moral victory, they can have their participation trophy. But there's one winner, there's one person that gets sworn in and one person who's not, and it's a winner takes all game. PERINO: I have to say, Geraldo, that reading Karl Rove's column this morning reminded me of August of 2006 when I was the deputy spokesperson and he was the political director and deputy chief of staff, and I'll go in and say, Karl, they're asking me again how you're feeling about the midterms, and he would tell me, well, all these things are going in our direction and -- until they weren't. (LAUGHTER) RIVERA: Until they weren't, yeah. Midterms are tough. But the thing about moral victories, it's interesting, the participation trophy, I think of a moral victory plus $2.75 gets you a token on the subway. They don't even use tokens anymore, the MTA cards. It is -- I think the Democrats are facing a potential problem with this division. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, we have been playing her. She's like the best advertisement for Republicans. But she represents a wing of the Democratic Party that's very fervent, energetic, but it is not the Nancy Pelosi mainstream wing of let's get things done. There is a division within the Democratic Party that I think bodes well for Republicans. I don't think Trump or the Republicans are out of the woods by any means. But I do think that at this stage with, you know, what is it? Less than three months to go before the election, the Democrats could be far more united, far more formidable. They have put up some good candidates. I mean, the guy running against Balderson in Ohio, good Danny boy is a good candidate. Came up short. I think there'll be some marginal shifting as of right now. If I were handicapping, I'd say it's basically a wash. The divided. PERINO: The one thing about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it's not that conservatives are putting her on television and interviewing her all the time. She's -- the media has made her a star. GUTFELD: Yeah, exactly. What's being done with her is what CNN did with Trump, and they've shined a spotlight on this unusual character and they laugh. But remember, who got the last laugh. It wasn't CNN. It was Trump. So, remember -- when you target somebody, often the target gets better because they're listening and they learned from the mistakes and they see what works, so she might grow precisely because of the sunlight. As for the ad. (CROSSTALK) RIVERA: I don't mean to cut you off, but do you think a 50-year-old white guy is going to vote for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez under any circumstances? GUTFELD: Of course. Of course. RIVERA: Any circumstances. But do you think that that's really going to happen? GUTFELD: Sure, why not. RIVERA: I don't see it. GUTFELD: Well, I think you asked that question so you can answer it. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: That's what Geraldo does. No, but I think in terms of -- I believe, for the Democrats, moral victories are to them real victories. And I hope they're undefeated with their moral victories because moral victories will not nominate a judge. They will not reverse any executive orders. You won't get to the White House on a moral victory. I'll take an immoral victory over a moral loss. PERINO: Jason, I want you to listen to Andrew Cuomo. He's telling Democrats to be less negative. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, D-N.Y.: I would like to see the Democratic Party, frankly, be less negative because Trump is doing the best negative case that we could ever do, and start to be more affirmative about what the Democrats will do when we get in power. If you look back, I believe that's why the Democrats have lost in the past. We've not had a credible vision that people believed would make their life better. And people have to believe you can do it. It can't be abstract, theoretical, pie in the sky. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right. Are Democrats to negative? CHAFFETZ: Yes. But they don't have anything to go to. They have the resistance movement, they have scorched earth, they want to raise your taxes, they want to give the gavel back to Nancy Pelosi. And if you ask yourself, what Democrats stand for, what do they really want to do? The answer is they want to get rid of the tax cuts. They want to go back to these policies that don't make any sense. I don't think they have a positive message. And the same Andrew Cuomo, we're going to talk about it later on the show, goes out and said, you know, I'm not going to cooperate with ICE. Well, that doesn't sound like somebody who's trying to be positive. PERINO: the other thing though, Morgan, is that -- as everybody complains about negative ads, but negative ads work. So if you're not in power, the only way to actually get your message across is to say the other person is doing bad. Even if you want to get a positive message out there, in some ways, I guess Alexandria, for example, is going out talking about Medicare for all, free tuition. ORTAGUS: Right. PERINO: It looks like a positive message, but if you're an independent voter it might be a negative. ORTAGUS: I just wish that people wouldn't keep comparing her to a beauty queen, because as a former beauty queen, I can say that everyone that I've worked with in the Miss America system is a hell a lot smarter than her. At least, better at being. (CROSSTALK) RIVERA: Why would you say that? ORTAGUS: Because I think she's terrible on television. I mean, look at the stuff that she says. RIVERA: She's terrible because she hasn't thought through how to pay for the wonderful programs that she keeps proposing. ORTAGUS: Right, because there is no way to pay for them without bankrupting the U.S. government. So, listen, what you're getting at is, you know, who is motivated to come out to the polls in November, right? That's the real question. And I think even if they don't have a unifying message, I do think the Democrats are motivated to come out. So, I think it's going to be a really long election night. It's going to be close in a lot of districts. But that -- while I don't love the message, I do think that they are motivated and I think that's why you're seeing the president get involved in these primaries and the races around the country because, quite frankly, he is what is most unifying -- most motivating. PERINO: It's quite interesting because right before the show the president was doing a roundtable in New Jersey. He was talking about prison reform. And you would think that most Democrats would agree with him on that, like want to come to the table and actually work with him on that. It's something that actually could get done. GUTFELD: It wasn't even a roundtable. Did you notice that? It was rectangular table. It's a rectangle table. OK. But what you're talking about -- the problems with the Democratic Party, it's not just the negative messaging but also a lack of ideas. And so, what's -- the interesting thing about Trump is that he's open to almost any idea. I mean, you saw that with North Korea is the ultimate example of being open to any idea. And I think he will be open to prison reform. He's open to even certain things about immigration that, I mean, granting, essentially, amnesty to over a million people. I want to bring up -- you know, I've spent a lot of time in pharmacies, just for reason that I can't get into. But the Democrat Party, when it comes to health care -- RIVERA: Condoms? GUTFELD: They're throwing socialism around because they don't have any ideas. Meanwhile, you looks at CVS, the drugstore, is unveiling a telemedicine app, right? This is going to allow you to go and see a doctor via -- whatever screen you have. That solves health care. Not socialism. Not free health care. Not -- you could give Bernie Sanders trillions of dollars, he would not come up with an idea like telemedicine. This is going to be solved -- all the problems are going to be solved by capitalism, because capitalism replaces force with innovation. And the Democrats are still stuck on force and they're scared of ideas and innovation. RIVERA: The problem is that nobody on either side of the aisle is going to work with the other side of the aisle. Infrastructure, for instance, a no- brainer. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: But that's why the private sector figures it out. But the private sector figures it out. Like that type of innovation, like you don't even have to have health insurance. If you want to pay out of your pocket for the telemedicine from CVS, and that could solve a lot of problems. GUTFELD: Yeah. But, I mean, that is the solution. It isn't socialism. The Democrats came up with specific ideas for once, you know, it'd be kind of encouraging. Just once, give us one idea. One. PERINO: We'll see if they hear you and if they respond with one idea, just one more idea. All right. RIVERA: How about legalizing someone who's been here for 30 years and has citizen children? PERINO: Well, that was what Greg just said, that the president was open to that. GUTFELD: Yeah, he was going to do that. And you're looking at some pretty progressive drug laws going on right now. PERINO: Yes, you are. All right, we could keep going but we have to move on and then come back to you. A New York Times columnist urges the mainstream media to team up against President Trump, and Greg will tell you why. GUTFELD: I will. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: In the New York Times yesterday, Thomas Friedman wrote that instead of prattling on about issues like jobs or the great economy, the media should spotlight Trump's evil personality because that will help the Democrats by discouraging Republicans from backing Trump. He wrote: \"The whole country needs to see every tweet, every rally, every word, and every reaction so that they can ask themselves, is this who I want my kids to see as our president?\" What a great idea. Because remember what happened the last time the media covered every tweet, every rally, every word, and every reaction of Donald Trump? When every wink, nudge, cough became part of the media's Snark-nado? They've elected Donald Trump, the bozos. Yes, there were like 300 Republican candidates, but all the yahoos in the press chased the orange meteor precisely for the things they hate about him now. Trump was great TV. He was shocking. Screw Rick Perry, Rand Paul, and all those other nobodies. This guy makes chance into a sure thing. Trump got like a billion-dollars-worth of free airtime and not led by Fox News who actually featured commentators who challenge Trump over his behavior and beliefs. It was CNN who led the charge and assorted other drips who didn't seem to mind because they thought Hillary had it in the bag anyway, and they had no other way to get people to watch their boring, mindless coverage. So telling the media to focus on Trump's behavior, you're in effect saying: Hey, remember how we elected Trump in 2016? Let's do it again. Isn't that true, Morgan? It seems like Friedman has amnesia. The more you focus on Trump, the better he does, I think. ORTAGUS: It's interesting that this advice is coming from people who -- it's like the most boring dinner party ever. They're having a glass of expensive wine and they're like, isn't Trump awful? And so, that's essentially -- you're having people that have no understanding of social media and how the president actually go straight to the America people advocating for the media covering him in general. I mean, this plays directly into his playbook, as you've said. And I think -- listen, I was on the other side of him in the primary, so I know what it's like for him to get all the media coverage. He did it brilliantly. He speaks directly to the American people. And I don't know what Friedman thinks he's doing. But I think the same people who read this and the Times are the same people who sit him at their boring dinner parties and complain about the president. RIVERA: Who've you worked for in the primary? ORTAGUS: Jeb. RIVERA: Oh, yeah. ORTAGUS: It didn't end well. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: There were a lot of people at Fox who were on the other side. And the thing is -- well, I was watching the coverage on CNN and going, you know, they're doing everything. PERINO: Not just CNN but. GUTFELD: MSBC. PERINO: . MSNBC. GUTFELD: Morning Joe should have been Morning Trump. PERINO: Absolutely. GUTFELD: Unlike Fox & Friends. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: I love Fox & Friends, I'm up every morning. Who should I talk to next? Jason, I'm looking at your face and I'm thinking, what's in your brain? What are you thinking? Is it good to get personal? CHAFFETZ: One of the biggest disappointment -- when I came into congress in 2008, when I got to the end, it's the lack of objective media. And I've seen how they've totally change the rules because things that they wouldn't cover under Barack Obama they now want to cover incessantly with Donald Trump. They have totally flipped the equation. And to be, in a contrived way, actually advocating, hey, look, this is what we need to do so we can all get together on the same page. GUTFELD: Yeah. CHAFFETZ: It's so contrived. There are very few media outlets that I really trust on that. You know, when you want to read the paper in the morning, people would always ask, I think the Wall Street Journal gives it the fairest, straightest objective viewpoint. But, you know, gone are the days of a New York Times or somebody like that that will objectively actually give you just the straight up news. GUTFELD: You know, I believe that's owned by our parent company. PERINO: I believe so. I'm a subscriber. GUTFELD: Well done. I steal your paper. PERINO: I'm old enough to remember that -- between 2000 and 2008, it was the same. GUTFELD: Yeah. PERINO: I mean, this is when the media, like, they have to fight against President Bush on everything, every issue, every utterance, every -- was amplified. And then, as Greg has pointed out, that they were asleep during the Obama years. GUTFELD: Obama place. PERINO: But I do think -- this is what I think that there has been some journalism that has had an effect on the Trump administration. If you look at the HHS, former HHS secretary, Tom Price, he had to resign after that reporting. The New York Times and others -- mainly the New York Times focusing on Scott Pruitt at the EPA, that was journalism -- they didn't focus on President Trump. They were doing their journalism and they've had an effect. I would also say that they've spent. GUTFELD: So did Pruitt. Pruitt had an effect. That's what he went after him. I mean, he was doing some good stuff, right? (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Yeah, he was doing stupid stuff too. PERINO: You can do, like, good policy without the other, which Andy Kessler is doing now. The other thing I would say, if they cover every tweet and every utterance, then they're not covering all the other stuff. GUTFELD: Yeah. PERINO: There's limited room in the newspaper. And if they just want to do the tweets, they can do that, and all the other stuff goes under the radar. GUTFELD: Yeah. RIVERA: What people -- like Tom Friedman who's a bright guy, but he's dead wrong on this. GUTFELD: He has a better moustache. RIVERA: What they don't get is that Trump is a movie star. He's got charisma. You've mentioned Jeb Bush. I like Jeb a lot. I mean, I've interviewed him a bunch of times when he was governor. But, next to Trump, it was like he had -- it was vanilla next to a banana split with a cherry on top. ORTAGUS: He did that one guy, one through the primary, and just took everybody out. RIVERA: Because they couldn't compete with someone with that kind of charisma. Now you can hate Trump, you can love Trump, but the thing is there is a magnetism about him. The more you see him and he doesn't blow the world up, it's like, hey, you know, maybe he's not so bad. The economy is OK. It's really good in fact. We're not at war with North Korea. Ii may work out. The Iranians, what have they done after they really heard us. And the more he's around, I think, the more people will get used to him. I think it really works in Trump's favor. ORTAGUS: What's surprising to me about the piece is that Friedman, sort of -- he put it out there that the media is not for the president. He sort of said the media should be against the president. GUTFELD: Yeah. He was honest. ORTAGUS: I mean, I thought, is he admitting the fake news. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: Like remember the time he was honest and he said I wish we could be China for a day. GUTFELD: Yeah. PERINO: We could get all sorts of done -- the things done that everybody went after him for saying, oh. GUTFELD: Yeah, every now and then he lets it slip. He pulls back the curtain and we see what we really know to be true. All right. Nancy Pelosi's outrageous new plan to help illegal immigrants, find out what it is, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) RIVERA: Nancy Pelosi adding fuel to the raging debate over immigration. The house minority leader urging voters to back Democratic candidates in the midterms to help her parties immigration agenda. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY PELOSI (D), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We are not going to be able to get it done under the Republican leadership incumbent. We believe that we will have leverage when we went in November. And why that's important, because it gives leverage to every family, to every mom who courageously brought her child across the desert to escape. (END VIDEO CLIP) RIVERA: That's the minority leader in El Paso. The Democratic governor of New York slamming ICE with this new threat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK GOVERNOR: I will do nothing cooperatively with ICE. I have sent them letters asking for an investigation. I have said if they do any criminal acts, which a police force can do, we will take criminal action against ICE, because I believe they are politically motivated. (END VIDEO CLIP) RIVERA: Let me ask you, congressman. Did you leave congress because of your frustration that the two bodies and the two sides could not work together? CHAFFETZ: That was a big part of it. I mean, something like immigration, I have passed a bill dealing with immigration, 385 votes in the house, very bipartisan. The senate didn't take it up. And the Harry Reid folks came over and said, hey, you know what the reasons were not going to do it is we can't allow Republicans have a victory on immigration. And it is terribly frustrating, it is wrong. But I think those messages are fundamentally wrong. And I do believe the polling that the number one issue going into the midterm will actually be immigration. There are only eight congressional days left in the House of Representatives. They have to pass a continuing resolution or an omnibus, and the president has laid down the law. There is going to be funding in there, or I will veto that bill. And that has to happen before the election. RIVERA: Do you take him at his word that he's actually going to shut down the government? And if he shuts down the government, how do you get it reopened? What happens to reopen once he shuts it? CHAFFETZ: This is why I think they need to make the case to the American people there's no reason out of a $4 trillion annual budget you can't put in their $25 billion to fund the wall. And if you extrapolate that over ten years, we're talking $40 trillion. RIVERA: All right. I'll give you 25 billion for the wall if you give me a green light for the dreamers. CHAFFETZ: I think what the president has offered goes far beyond what he promised in the election. He's actually agreed to do that sort of thing. RIVERA: So, you would allow what many in the party call amnesty for the Dreamers? CHAFFETZ: I reject the amnesty. I don't think you have to put them on a pathway to citizenship, but I do think you can give them some legal status so that they have the certainty. But you've got to get rid of the rewards and incentives to be here illegally. And what Nancy Pelosi is doing in El Paso is morally wrong to encourage people to cross that desert but their lives on the line. They should be going to the U.S. embassy in El Salvador rather than putting life in peril. RIVERA: Are you shocked, Morgan, that the abolished ICE plank -- ORTAGUS: Yes. RIVERA: -- has gained such credibility in the democratic mainstream? ORTAGUS: I am shocked, you know, you know about the Democrat mainstream more than I do. I think by the -- RIVERA: I'm not a Democrat. ORTAGUS: -- by the moderate victories -- RIVERA: I am a -- ORTAGUS: -- in Michigan and Ohio -- RIVERA: -- immigrant lover. ORTAGUS: -- from the Democrat Party, I think that the moderates have won in that part. The thing that surprised me so much as I've worked closely for the past over a decade with people at DHS and ICE when I was in government and my reserve capacity. And these are people that -- you know, that sign up to serve their government, to serving faithfully. And I sort of see what's happening to ICE is the same thing that I think we saw, you know, several years ago, the Democrats doing to police around America. So it was OK to bash the police a few years ago. Now, it's OK to bash ICE, if you want to talk about reforming the institution, that's fine. We need reform all day every day, and many government institutions. But the disparaged people who raise their hand and take an oath to serve our country is flat-out disgusting. RIVERA: I agree with Jason's proposal, Dana, that immigration is the biggest issue. Because I think it encapsulates a lot of other things like -- PERINO: Everything. Right. RIVERA: -- race and -- PERINO: Jobs. RIVERA: -- jobs and social class and all the rest of it. But which image is more powerful? The classic image of a brown wave overwhelming the southern border, all these immigrants coming in and ruining our quality of life, or ICE going into peaceable homes and going after, you know, Diego Garcia, who's been a gardener here for 30 years and he married an American citizen and his children were all born here and they were public (ph), too. Which image is more powerful, and won't that, in Jason's -- PERINO: I guess it depends on where you sit, right? So, I think that the wave is definitely probably the more powerful image, as the president paints it. But, you know, like earlier this week, there was a story about a marine whose wife who had come here illegally 30 years ago or something, they have two children. He has served in Iraq three times. She got deported. And that story -- it was an A.P. story but it doesn't get a ton of coverage. But if you get enough of those, that you might actually start to see some pushback. I actually think that President Trump, if the Republicans lose the House, his chances of getting an immigration bill that he could live with and that he could support and that would be good for the country is more possible than if the Republicans keep the House. RIVERA: Why? PERINO: Because the Republicans have shown over and over that they're not willing to make a deal. And also because of what Jason just said. Because the Democrats are saying, well, we can't give the Republicans a win. Think of what Newt Gingrich did in 1996 with Bill Clinton on welfare reform. It was a big issue. What did that do? It helped President Clinton win reelection because it basically changes the paradigm. So it's not that this can't get done, if nothing else, if the Republicans lose. I actually think it's more likely it gets done because of Trump. RIVERA: Where do you stand on that? I don't know, I mean, which of those images really grips you? GUTFELD: Yes, I reject the black-and-white nature of this conversation. You can hold a number of stances, competing stances on immigration. It's just like a stock portfolio. OK. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: So, you can be for a process that enables safe legal immigration while curbing illegal immigration or other types of immigration. When you say something like that, you feed into the media's gaping maw and they turns into you hate foreigners. It's either you are for this or you are against this. And if you're for law, something is wrong with you. That's not how it is. You can hold a number of different positions and it all makes sense. For example, the difference between the right and the left are laws. The difference in the immigration debate is the stance of abiding a law. The conservatives, Republicans wanted you to abide by the law. The left are saying no, no, no, sanctuary, sanctuary. People are fleeing. Refugees are fleeing countries precisely because there are laws missing. The reason why they're coming to America is because our laws create order which enables freedom that allows people to live their lives in safety. If you look at Somalia, which has no laws, the Congo, Venezuela, which are -- was chaos, they have no laws. You've got to get out. So I think -- RIVERA: I think that hold the got to obey the law stuff is such B.S., I really think it is such cover. GUTFELD: Well, that's not a (INAUDIBLE) -- RIVERA: It's such a cover -- GUTFELD: What am I covering, Geraldo? RIVERA: -- you're avoiding dealing with the issue of where are you in terms of -- GUTFELD: I just explained you the issue, you totally ignored what I said. RIVERA: I mean, what are you going to say -- GUTFELD: OK, let me explain it to you one more time and I'll do it slow. You can have competing notions about immigration. You can be for legal immigration because you want more immigrants here. I'm that guy. I'm -- and if there's a -- I'm even for a pathway to citizenship. However, I believe that illegal immigration is breaking the law. If you can somehow adjust that -- RIVERA: So is speeding. GUTFELD: Yes, and I'm against speeding too. I am sure you're not, though, Geraldo. You probably speed without a shirt (ph). RIVERA: The sit-down showdown intensifies. President is telling America - - thanks for the pen. Stay tuned as his legal team attacks the Mueller probe. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: You gave me bad hailing (ph), I'm impressed. President Trump tweeting stay tuned while slamming the so-called rigged witch hunt as his legal team continues to attack the special counsel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: I've never been involved in an investigation on either side that's more illegitimate. If it isn't over by September, then we have a very, very serious violation of the Justice Department rules that you shouldn't be conducting one of these investigations in the 60-day period. The real story here is not that this case isn't going to fizzle. It's going to blow up on them. There's a lot more to what they did that nobody knows about yet. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHAFFETZ: Giuliani also saying drawn-out negotiations over a potential interview with the president could benefit the GOP in the midterms. Dana, what's (ph) your -- PERINO: No -- so then, we should keep the investigation going through -- CHAFFETZ: Yes. PERINO: -- December to help the midterms rather than saying that it should be wrapped up by September. We got to take -- because they have to take their pick on that. CHAFFETZ: Given a chance to wrap this thing up -- PERINO: And also, I just remember that Senator Grassley, when he interviewed -- when he had Comey there to testify, he said, why did you let a date drive your decision on an investigation into Hillary Clinton. That's inappropriate. The investigation should finish when it finishes and you shouldn't try to do that. So, anyway. They're a little bit (INAUDIBLE) of doing that. CHAFFETZ: And, Geraldo, they're going to have a hard time with that argument in light of what happened to Hillary Clinton. I mean, the Democrats aren't going to buy into that. But how do you see this playing out in the midterms? RIVERA: I think, first of all, the attack on Hillary Clinton during Benghazi is why her candidacy had legs anyway. I thought it was a big mistake by the Republicans, went way overboard. And I think that you wish you could have picked on (ph) that. CHAFFETZ: More people were killed. RIVERA: Not by Hillary Clinton. GUTFELD: That's B.S. To quote Geraldo, that's B.S. CHAFFETZ: Oh my goodness, we're switching topics. RIVERA: I like it, though. In terms of the Mueller investigation of the president, the one thing I want to say, and if the president credits my advice to -- even to the slightest degree, I hope he listens to me. Do not testify before Mueller's investigation. It is a trap. It is absolutely -- it's a landline you cannot survive. For example, I say it's a perjury trap, here's the question, I'm Mueller. You are the president. Did you ever cheat on your wife, Mr. President? What's your answer? What's your answer? You got to answer. ORTAGUS: Jason looks really nervous right now. CHAFFETZ: You know, I've never cheated on my wife. RIVERA: He cannot put himself in -- I don't care, Mueller could promise the world velvet gloves. You know, going to take good care of you. CHAFFETZ: And based on your Benghazi answer, your time has expired. ORTAGUS: I forgot what we're talking about. What is it, Benghazi? CHAFFETZ: No, the midterms -- ORTAGUS: Oh, OK. CHAFFETZ: -- is this really going to -- I mean, if it's -- Giuliani is saying that there's a lot more information's going to come out here. But do we really -- does this motivate -- you mentioned earlier, the motivation is what drives turnout. And do people say, hey, we got to get out there and protect our president? ORTAGUS: I think what law enforcement has to be careful about is proven by Jim Comey the most is that they're not politicians and they don't understand politics. And as you talked about Hillary Clinton, I think if we brought anyone from her campaign on right now, they would blame Jim Comey, right, for what he did, you know, a few weeks before the election. So I do think that Mueller has to be careful, and I do think that even though he has a lot of credibility, there's legitimate reasons when the president says there are 17 angry Democrats and people that attended Hillary's election night party and people who donated. For the average American watching it, my problem with that is that we have lost both sides, different points have lost faith and credibility in this FBI and then the DOJ. And I don't think that's a good thing. I think during the election, Democrats were mad at the FBI. Now, Republicans are. And it's not good for this to be partisan. We need to have a set of rules where they say, OK, there is no standard, right? There's only the memo written in 2012 from the then attorney general. So we need to have a standard as we get closer to elections. What is the standard that we're all going? Why, am I really boring you that much? PERINO: Now, we only had 30 seconds left. GUTFELD: No, I'm suffering from investigation fatigue. I think I can speak for all of America that they would rather do my laundry than hear about this investigation anymore. Remember Beckel? PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: He used to boycott segments. He just go like this. PERINO: Yes, what segments did he boycott? GUTFELD: Benghazi. I'm just -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: No one cares America, you know this, you don't care, you don't care about this collusion stuff because he know it's B.S. PERINO: Can I add one last thing? GUTFELD: You know it's B.S. PERINO: John Yoo who we all know is a -- GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: -- legal scholar, he teaches at Berkeley now, so he's on a 2:00 show today. It surprised me but he said he believes the president should testify. And it's coming from John Yoo, but he said he is the chief law enforcement officer -- CHAFFETZ: And the right answer -- PERINO: -- (INAUDIBLE) to do it. CHAFFETZ: The right answer is, the president will testify because he does things very differently than any advice he gets. (INAUDIBLE) our smartphones leading to the death of conversations. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ORTAGUS: Our smartphones killing conversations. A new study says it's trending that way. According to British researchers, we're talking to each other less on our mobile phones despite our addiction to these devices. Popular messaging apps like Skype and Snapchat are slashing the amount of time spent on traditional voice calls. So, is this the beginning of the end for verbal communication? Dana, wait, hold on. PERINO: Are you going to call me? (CROSSTALK) ORTAGUS: Yes. So anyway, that was my attempt at humor. PERINO: Yes, I think there's -- all the studies, right, that people prefer -- they think it's rude to call now. ORTAGUS: It is. PERINO: Right? And that -- ORTAGUS: I think so. PERINO: So the thing is, if you called, it would take less time to communicate your message than if you were texting five times to figure out where you were in the park to hook up. Or meet up, whatever. GUTFELD: Whoa, Dana. PERINO: (INAUDIBLE) meet up. ORTAGUS: What does that mean? GUTFELD: Hooking up in the park. Dana, hooking up in the park. Rock and roll, Dana. PERINO: I also was going to say -- GUTFELD: First, she started swearing, now she's hooking up in the park. What else is she doing? ORTAGUS: Calling on (INAUDIBLE). PERINO: I also wanted to commend Arthur Brooks, he has a new podcast. He's head of AEI and he talked about this whole problem about phones killing conversation. And one of the things he talked about was how humans evolve and that we have a voice and that our voice is a tool. And so that's how you know that Greg is telling a joke. If he just texts you something, you don't know. But you use your voice in order to do that. ORTAGUS: That's why you use an emoji. Jason. I feel like you're all going to school (ph) me as the millennial in the (INAUDIBLE). CHAFFETZ: Well, the short answer is yes, and I love that we're still calling them smartphones because it's not like there's a lot of dumb ones out there anymore. They do almost everything you could possibly want them to do. My biggest concern is how it's going to change particularly a younger generation. I think sporting events, with the Supreme Court ruling, it's going to totally change how you watch sports now that gaming is going to happen on those phones. You're going to be, hey, is he going to make the free throw or not. And people betting five bucks. It's going to totally change that. And I'm really worried what the government and private companies are doing with facial recognition. Government already has, one out of every two people is already in a database of the FBI. I don't -- ORTAGUS: Jason, you're taking this way too seriously. CHAFFETZ: No, but I totally worry about this. I lose sleep over this stuff. PERINO: Chill out. ORTAGUS: OK. Do you lose sleep over your smartphone? RIVERA: I -- what I don't do is have voice messages on my phone. ORTAGUS: Oh, I hate that. RIVERA: I didn't set up my phone at all for voice messages. ORTAGUS: Agreed. RIVERA: Because I found what people do is, they want to make a point. You know, go -- you have to go pick up the garbage and then do that and they say OK. And you have no chance to respond, to rebut, to deny, to -- so I don't -- as a result, I don't have a lot of talking on my telephone (ph). ORTAGUS: So Greg, if I told you -- GUTFELD: Not set up the voice -- yes. ORTAGUS: If I call you, Greg, would you answer the phone? GUTFELD: Of course, I would. You know, the great -- they say kill it -- this also prevents conversations, which is great because whenever I see like Kilmeade coming down the hall and he's like about to talk to me, I'm like -- PERINO: Oh. ORTAGUS: Oh, sorry. GUTFELD: Yes, sorry, and then I do that. I am so good at impersonating serious angry phone call because no one interrupts an angry phone call when you're like, look, I told you already -- ORTAGUS: Yes, yes, you -- GUTFELD: -- the tests were negative. ORTAGUS: You walk away. GUTFELD: And then no one will go near me. But by the way, we had this conversation about video games 20 years ago, 48 years ago with TV, 200,000 years ago, it was about the destructive impact of cave drawings. So whenever there's technology, we always get these fears. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: But what this is, this is just an external drive for your brain. You have everything in the universe in this thing. You got every book, so you don't have to keep it in here. ORTAGUS: Well, I think that talking on the phone is weird because I'm a millennial. So talking in the phone is (INAUDIBLE) today, Gernie (ph), I love you. And I will always talk to you on the phone. PERINO: How many times you want to tell us you're millennial? We get it, are you age shaming the rest of us at the table? ORTAGUS: No, it's because I'm actually like I'm a really old millennial and I want to hold on to my youth because I kind of in that one. GUTFELD: I'm Gen X. PERINO: Me, too. ORTAGUS: Yes. RIVERA: The big fear I have is that people are missing the real world because their heads are buried. GUTFELD: That's true. PERINO: And the real world is great. RIVERA: And the world is great. But this is better. GUTFELD: Butterflies and mountains (ph). PERINO: These are great, too. GUTFELD: Yes. ORTAGUS: OK. Well, one more thing is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: It's time now for one more thing. I will call on myself, Dana. OK, it's nearly back-to-school season and that means all of our fabulous college associates are headed back to school. They've been amazing. I think that the Fox News college associate program is certainly one of the best I've ever been involved with. All of these guys get to participate and learn across the channel and all the different departments and today at The Five, it's our college associate Mollie's last day with us. Mollie has been a key part of our team over the last few months, she's -- there she is. She's going to be headed back to the University of Maryland in the fall so she can cheer on the terrapins. So to Mollie and all of our college associates, congratulations, thank you, and go do a good semester's worth of work and maybe we'll hire you one day. OK, Greg. GUTFELD: They weren't that great. Hey, I'm going to be at Ridgewood, New Jersey at 8:00 signing books. So if you're in the neighborhood, drive on over, I will sign your book and I'll say something really rude to one of your parents. All right, let's do this. We're just around the corner from NFL preseason, oh, we're going to love some of this, this is the Dallas pit bulls, take a look. Fuzzy McPoe (ph) is one of the brightest stars right now and, man, he can deliver a hit. There he is, Fuzzy. Where is Frisky (ph)? Oh, Frisky Buttkisses (ph) coming after him, this is some really thrilling tape, I can tell by the response of my panelists who think that maybe I have a mental illness. PERINO: I mean, where do you get these things? These are complex (ph). GUTFELD: They're given to be by a man named, Sean (ph). PERINO: Oh, I know Sean well. GUTFELD: And you know what, he gives them to me in the park where you hook up. PERINO: You'll have to tell me more about that. Geraldo. RIVERA: Well, Saturday night, I'll be attending in East Hampton a benefit called Authors Night, it's authors night in Amagansett, New York in the Hamptons, it's in the east end of Long Island. If you head there, stop by, we'll be signing (INAUDIBLE) my book, The Geraldo Show, all right, it's much more renaissance than you give it credit for. It's an event that hosts hundreds of authors, a room full of authors last year. It was really mob (ph) there, it's 107. It's hosted by, this will be interesting, Alec Baldwin, and his wife, Hilaria. She has her own book. But it'll be interesting, I wonder how Alec is going to respond to me being there. PERINO: I bet he gives you a big bear hug. RIVERA: Oh, I don't know. PERINO: Congratulations, that's a great book. RIVERA: Thank you. Come by, see me, pick up a copy of my book. PERINO: And also Geraldo will insult your parents like Greg. OK, Jason. CHAFFETZ: Law enforcement needs all the help it can get, and in Florida, they got a different kind of help. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The cow, if you see the large group of cows, they're literally following her and chasing her. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHAFFETZ: This is in Seminole County, there's three people, they're in a car chase, the one person gets out, the female driver, she's lost, she doesn't know what she's doing and these cows come to the rescue by chasing this would-be (ph) perpetrator, alleged perpetrator and their law enforcement took her down. With the help of the cows, she's lucky they didn't run into a gator. PERINO: That was a good move. Morgan. ORTAGUS: All right, I got good stuff (ph), but -- so we have some pictures here, 11 years ago, I was in Baghdad and I celebrated Hanukkah in Saddam's palace which was the embassy at the time. And it was a really cold movement. I ran into someone this weekend unbeknownst to me who I spent Hanukkah dinner with in Baghdad 11 years ago and, actually, it's pretty funny, this Marine Corps officer let me drive his Humvee around the green zone, which I'm not going to say his name. But it was pretty cool to run into someone 11 years later from my favorite war zone (ph). PERINO: Yes, and where you observed (ph) so admirably. Thank you for all of your service. We appreciate it. Thanks for being here today, set your DVRs, never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" He's a news guy, you can't help but like. Up next, it's Mike Emanuel. MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS: Well done.

            "article_content": "Are Republicans ready to take this challenge from the far left seriously? Matt Gorman from the National Republican Congressional Committee weighs in on 'Fox News @ Night with Shannon Bream.' When Democratic socialists Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders rallied for a left-wing congressional candidate Friday afternoon in Kansas, they insisted their agenda is \"mainstream.\" Sanders, the Vermont senator and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate who spent the afternoon campaigning in Wichita for Democratic congressional candidate James Thompson, boasted that ideas \u201conce considered to be radical\u201d are now part \u201cof the mainstream conversation.\u201d \u201cWith allies like Alexandria and James in the Congress, we are going to pass a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program,\u201d Sanders told the crowd. \u201cAnd please understand that this idea of Medicare for all \u2013 this is not a radical idea.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, the 28-year-old progressive who surprisingly defeated longtime Rep. Joe Crowley in New York\u2019s Democratic primary last month, struck a similar tone, as she also called for Medicare for all, free college tuition and a guaranteed living wage for all persons. \u201cThey said the people of Kansas don\u2019t want those things,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the crowd. \u201cThey told me that I would not be welcomed. But you have proven them wrong.\u201d She said the United States should be a nation that \u201callows improved and expanded Medicare for all,\u201d where every child should be \u201cborn with the opportunity to go to college or trade school free of cost\u201d and\u00a0 \u201cevery person in this country is paid a living wage to lead a dignified life.\u201d Sanders, who also called for making public colleges and universities tuition free, acknowledged the high expense of delivering on these promises. SOCIALISTS WORKING FROM WITHIN TO PUSH DEMOCRATIC PARTY FURTHER LEFT \u201cOur political opponents, you know, they\u2019ll tell us, that\u2019s a great idea Bernie, but you know it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re right. These proposals are expensive. But we say to them, making higher education available to all Americans, regardless of income, is a hell of a lot better investment than giving tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations.\u201d In Wichita, Thompson came close to winning in a special election last year, and is taking his second shot at unseating GOP Rep. Ron Estes. Later Friday, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders were scheduled to stump for Democratic congressional candidate Brent Welder in Kansas City. OCASIO-CORTEZ HITS CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH BERNIE SANDERS Welder is running against GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder, whom President Trump endorsed on Twitter this week as someone who has voted for \"$5 BILLION for Border Security\" and who \"loves our Military and Vets.\" Welder, who worked as a labor lawyer and wants a $15 minimum wage and touts a \"Medicare for all\" platform, has polled ahead of Yoder, and his 3rd District went to Hillary Clinton by a slim margin in 2016. Ocasio-Cortez made a gaffe during the Friday evening event, when she urged voters to \"flip this seat red\" for Welder, instead of flipping it blue, Mediaite.com reported. Primaries in Kansas take place Aug. 7. Fox News\u2019 Gregg Re contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Comments made by New York Democratic primary winner draw criticism from Democrats; former aide to Senator Schumer Chris Hahn and political strategist Mark Penn react on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is hitting the national campaign trail this week with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to stump for other left-wing candidates, even as the upstart 28-year-old democratic socialist's rising profile continues to rankle top Democrats. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are expected to campaign on July 20 for two congressional candidates seeking to unseat Republican incumbents in Kansas: James Thompson in Wichita, and former Sanders delegate Brent Welder in the suburbs of Kansas City. But Ocasio-Cortez is also set to support several progressives seeking to supplant Democratic incumbents elsewhere -- alarming\u00a0Democratic leaders and pundits\u00a0who worry that her rising national profile and far-left politics might fracture the party ahead of critical midterm elections. DEFEATED 10-TERM INCUMBENT JOE CROWLEY SEEKS TO EASE TENSIONS AFTER OCASIO-CORTEZ'S SHOCK WIN On July 28 and 29, Ocasio-Cortez will visit Michigan to lend her national spotlight to Abdul El-Sayed, 33, a progressive candidate for governor. She will travel throughout Michigan, stopping in places including Grand Rapids, Flint and Detroit. El-Sayed is Detroit\u2019s ex-public health commissioner, and looks to upset Democratic former State Sen. Gretchen Whitmer. \"Alexandria\u2019s victory was a proof of concept for campaigns like ours,\u201d\u00a0El-Sayed told The Washington Post. \"If her win makes her into ... the new face of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party's not going to have a very bright future.\" Ocasio-Cortez has also endorsed other progressives seeking to take down incumbent Democratic lawmakers, including and Delaware Sen.\u00a0Tom Carper and Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Adam Smith of Washington, and\u00a0Michael Capuano of Massachusetts. WATCH: JOE LIEBERMAN SAYS DEMS WON'T HAVE A 'BRIGHT FUTURE' IF OCASIO-CORTEZ IS THEIR MODEL In Kansas' Republican-leaning 4th District, where Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez will team up Friday, Thompson came close to winning in a special election last year, and is taking his second shot at unseating GOP Rep. Ron Estes. Meanwhile, far-left Welder is running against GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder, whom President Trump endorsed on Twitter this week as someone who has voted for \"$5 BILLION for Border Security\" and who \"loves our Military and Vets.\" Welder, who worked as a labor lawyer and wants a $15 minimum wage and touts a \"Medicare for All\" platform, has polled ahead of Yoder, and his 3rd District went to Hillary Clinton by a slim margin in 2016. Primaries in both Kansas and Michigan take place Aug. 7. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge boost to our campaign to welcome Senator Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to Wichita,\u201d Thompson said in a statement. \u201cThe interest and enthusiasm here has been electric.\u201d But even as the progressive pair seek to export their brand of progressive politics to the Sunflower State and beyond, top Democratic leaders have increasingly sounded the alarm. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla.,\u00a0charged this week\u00a0that Ocasio-Cortez was overly idealistic. \"Meteors fizz out,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cWhat she will learn in this institution is that it\u2019s glacial to begin with, and therefore no matter how far you rise, that\u2019s just how far you will ultimately get your comeuppance. \u201cYou come up here and you\u2019re going to be buddy-buddy with all the folks or you\u2019re going to make them do certain things?\u00a0 Ain\u2019t happening, O.K.?\u201d Hastings added. And Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., said that Ocasio-Cortez's decision to pubicly feud with longtime Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., even after she defeated him in a shocking primary contest last month was upsetting Democrats in the House. \"She\u2019s not asking my advice,\u201d Pascrell said. \"I would do it differently, rather than make enemies of people.\u201d Rep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo. -- who is facing a primary challenge from the left by community\u00a0activist Cori Bush, who has Ocasio-Cortez's backing -- was more direct. \u201cOnce an election is over and you win, why are you still angry?\u201d Clay asked. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lack of maturity on her part, and a lack of political acumen, for her to be that petty.\" That sentiment was echoed by former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, who was the Democratic Party's candidate for vice president in 2000,\u00a0in an interview with Fox News\u00a0on Wednesday. \"When I see somebody who really says she's a socialist -- she's a very captivating, charismatic candidate -- when you look at those policies, those policies will not be supported in many places across America,\" Lieberman said. \"If her win makes her into what Kellyanne Conway called the new face of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party's not going to have a very bright future,\" he added. Lieberman wrote a\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed\u00a0calling for voters to reject Ocasio-Cortez in the November elections. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In the midterm elections many states carried initiatives on the ballot. From marijuana laws to California\u2019s gas tax increase, here are some of the states that passed new measures and what they mean. I was actually on Fox News Channel on Election night when the channel\u2019s Decision Desk called the House of Representatives for the Democrats. What fortuitous timing! Anchor Martha MacCallum asked me how I felt and \u201cI\u2019m so relieved\u201d came flying out of my mouth. Relief was the overwhelming sentiment I heard from my fellow Democrats about Tuesday\u2019s midterm election results. Just like in 2016, the exit polls looked good for us: Health care was the number one issue by miles and Democrats have led on the issue by double digits for months. Guns were the fourth most important issue, another winner for my party. Trump\u2019s approval numbers with women were terrible with only 39 percent of women giving him a positive approval rating and 60 percent of women giving him a disapproval rating. Three-quarters of voters 18-29 broke for Democrats on Tuesday night with well over a million new registrants in that age range. Nearly half of voters thought Trump\u2019s immigration policies were too tough and that the new tax law has had no impact on their personal finances. Looks like the making of a good night. But history has told us to be cautious and rightfully so as we ended up losing more Senate seats than planned and very emotional gubernatorial races in Florida and Ohio. Although holding on to Tester\u2019s seat in Montana on Wednesday was a senate silver lining, losing three of our red state senators was a tough pill to swallow. Despite those losses, which are tough to stomach, Democrats accomplished a tremendous amount last night. We flipped at least 29 House seats, seven governors\u2019 seats, one Senate seat, four GOP super-majorities in state legislatures were broken, an astounding 330 state legislative seats and three state Supreme Court seats were flipped, too. We did this by campaigning on our values of equality and diversity. Just look at who we elected: Since Trump\u2019s election, thousands of stories have been written about the political mobilization of women whether running for office, getting involved locally, marching, phone banking or even just dressing their babies up as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg aka \u201cRBG\u201d for Halloween. Unlike 2016, female voters did not let us down on Election Day. White women broke evenly between Democrats and Republicans whereas 55 percent of them had supported Trump in 2016. And overall, 59 percent of women backed Democrats. And they propelled a spate of female candidates to higher office. Nineteen of our 29+ House seats are held by women. And we expanded the number of female Democratic governors from two to at least six with wins by Laura Kelly of Kansas, Janet Mills of Maine, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. Trump\u2019s backing surely helped in key Senate races like Indiana and Missouri. That\u2019s undeniable. But it should also be noted that at least 32 Trump backed candidates lost last night. That\u2019s not a small number. Leading Democratic figures have been telling us for months what was at stake Tuesday and Democrats showed up to ensure that social security is safe, Medicare is safe, the ACA is safe and that there will be no more tax cuts for the one percent. We will now have a better chance at fair redistricting. Voters in six states approved proposals to protect victims of crimes. One and a half million Floridians who were convicted felons will now have their right to vote restored. The minimum wage is going up in Arkansas and Missouri. Three states expanded Medicaid. The legalization of marijuana continues across the country. We voted our values on Tuesday and it paid off. Rest assured we will continue to fight over the next two years until we take back 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, too.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" October 4, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: All right, Tucker.\u00a0\nThanks for being with us. What a busy news night.\u00a0\nWelcome to \"Hannity.\"\u00a0\nThe FBI investigation is over. The results are in. The Senate's findings have been totally confirmed and Judge Brett Kavanaugh is an overwhelmingly qualified candidate for the United States Supreme Court.\u00a0\nNow, he is backed by a long and extra ordinary track record. He is admired by his colleagues, well-liked by the community, loved by his family and friends, until 17 days ago. And the FBI inquiry showed once again that the allegations against him have zero corroboration. None. Instead, the claims are refuted, denied, by everyone who was interviewed.\u00a0\nNow, the Democratic witch hunt is officially over. Their delay tactics have hit a dead end, but the crybaby smear merchants on the left -- they're still grandstanding. They're resistance holding protest on Capitol Hill.\u00a0\nSenate Democrats bashing the FBI tonight in their investigation. Democrats across America -- well, they are extreme they worried because their shameful attempts to ruin a man's life for political gains have now been exposed.\u00a0\nAnd we are just 33 days away from the important midterm elections, and what do we see in the polling tonight? Republican candidates are now surging. Truth, justice, common sense, it might prevail after all.\u00a0\nJudge Kavanaugh is once again coming to his own defense and a brand-new op- ed just released.\u00a0\nNow, sit tight, buckle up. It's time for our breaking news, busy news night, opening monologue.\u00a0\n(MUSIC)\u00a0\nHANNITY: The seventh FBI background check into Judge Kavanaugh is finished, it's wrapped, and now, a confirmation vote for Judge Brett Kavanaugh could come as early as Saturday.\u00a0\nPresident Trump, he is looking forward to this vote.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Democrats have been trying to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh.\u00a0\n(BOOS)\u00a0\nSince the very first second he was announced, and he was announced for one simple reason. He has an incredible intellect, an incredible person, an incredible talent.\u00a0\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\u00a0\nHe's been an incredible judge. Because they know that Judge Kavanaugh will protect, uphold, and defend the Constitution of the United States as written.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: And tonight, many U.S. senators, they are on the fence, but they're responding positively to today's FBI report. According to Senator Jeff Flake, a swing vote, the FBI's report revealed zero new evidence against Kavanaugh. Senator Collins of Maine, another crucial swing vote, praised the investigation for being very thorough.\u00a0\nHere is bottom line. If both Flake and Collins vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh, he will be a Supreme Court justice.\u00a0\nAnd today, at a very fiery press conference, Senate Republicans had this to say about the impending vote and this horrific process. Take a look.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPO)\u00a0\nSEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R\u2014K.Y., MAJORITY LEADER: What we know for sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.\u00a0\nSEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY, R\u2014IOWA, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: This is the 87th day -- that is three weeks longer than the average of the last three or four nominees to the Supreme Court. So, don't tell me we haven't spent enough time.\u00a0\nWhat I have been dealing with since July 10th, the downhill slope that Schumer has put us on is really dealing with a demolition derby. They just about destroyed a good person, to be on the Supreme Court.\u00a0\nSEN. JOHN CORNYN, R\u2014TEXAS: A vote against Judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be a vote for abusing the confirmation process and a good person. And it will be a vote for the shameful intimidation tactics that have been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign. This is a search and destroy mission. This is not a search for the truth.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: And tonight, it is important to remember, more documentation was provided to the Senate judiciary committee, than any Supreme Court nominee in history. And so far, this nomination process is the third longest in the past 50 years.\u00a0\nBut tonight, the smear merchants on the left are in full on freak-out mode. Senate Democrats who all demanded an FBI investigation to be done quickly with limited scope, just last week, they're now trashing that very same FBI investigation.\u00a0\nNew Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, he called it a B.S. investigation on Twitter. Naturally, the whining continued when there's a television camera in front of these -- well, publicity hungry Democrats. Take a look.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D\u2014N.Y., MAJORITY LEADER: We Democrats had many fears that this would be an all too limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting the facts. Having received a thorough briefing a few minutes ago, our fears have been realized.\u00a0\nSEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D\u2014CONN.: This set of interviews is, at best, most charitably, woefully incomplete. To put it bluntly, it smacks of a whitewash, even a cover-up.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In your view, is this a fulsome and credible investigation?\u00a0\nSEN. ED MARKEY, D\u2014MASS.: It's obviously a cover-up. They are making a mockery of the constitutional requirement that the Senate provide its advice and consent.\u00a0\nSEN. BOB MENENDEZ, D\u2014N.J.: That report, if that's an investigation, that's (EXPLETIVE DELETED) investigation.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Every one of these Democrats were against Judge Kavanaugh or anyone president Trump would have nominated to the court.\u00a0\nOn this program, while we have exposed the few, the few, top echelon, in the FBI that did abuse their power, we have always made a point almost on a nightly basis to stand up for the rank-and-file FBI agents, field agents, you know, the ones that risked their lives, like other law enforcement, for us, every single day. Including those that conducted the supplemental background check.\u00a0\nThe FBI acted in a fair, independent manner. Some on the left don't like the results. The calls for a more thorough investigation is beyond absurd.\u00a0\nWhat is the FBI supposed to do? We don't have a location to investigate, no date to investigate. There's no physical evidence. There's no forensic evidence. And we don't even know the day of the week.\u00a0\nAnd every single person that Professor Ford listed to corroborate her story denied any knowledge of her claims. And the one eyewitness that she listed, totally refuted her claim. Even her longtime friend had no idea what she was talking about. They all refuted her claims under penalty of perjury, now twice.\u00a0\nThe other allegations against Kavanaugh, they are even more shaky. The second accuser making decades-old claims that Kavanaugh had exposed himself as a freshman in college at a party. Well, she wasn't even sure that Kavanaugh was the perpetrator. Even \"The New York Times\" wouldn't publish her claims, and they searched far and wide for evidence to corroborate her story. They found nothing, except that she had been making calls to other Yale classmates at the time saying, I'm not sure it is him, do you remember?\u00a0\nAnd the third accuser making systematic, drugging, gang rape allegation against teenage girls and her story has changed many times in about a week. She is facing serious credibility issues, and of course, represented by Michael Avenatti, you know, lawyer of the year.\u00a0\nNone of these allegations have dates, locations, witnesses, evidence, corroboration, of any kind, of any of these claims. So do Democrats really expect to be FBI to magically find decades-old evidence proving that Kavanaugh was an evil sexual predator, systemic gang rapist, somebody that drugged teenage girls. They really believe that the American people would suspend all decency, all common sense and a belief that a man with an impeccable 40-year track record was really secretly a monster in his youth and did this almost on a weekly basis?\u00a0\nIn reality, this has always been about politics and power. A delay tactic, a transparent attempt to literally ruin a man's life, destroy his family. Because they lost an election and they want the power. This has become a national disgrace.\u00a0\nAnd in some cases, these political tactics worked. Democratic senator from North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp, by the way, now down 11 in the latest poll, claimed to be an independent voice for the people of North Dakota. Tonight, we know she is nothing more than a shill for Schumer and the Democratic Party. Now, I guess she assumed she is not getting reelected, so she is trashing the will of her own constituents in voting no.\u00a0\nThen you got John Donnelly, Indiana, also a \"no\" vote. By the way, he's up for reelection in 33 days. By the way, Indiana voters, you can send him a message and get out and vote.\u00a0\nWe are seeing the Democratic Party play -- literally, their playbook roll out in full force. Everything that we have chronicled on a regular basis on the show, we now begin our 23rd year on the FOX News Channel, 30 in radio. There's now a big crescendo into one of the most despicable displays in anything we have ever witnessed.\u00a0\nAnd I warned you, they are going to try and bork Kavanaugh or whoever the president picked, and then bring back the Clarence Thomas tactics. The smear machine of the left is in full gear. They know no bounds.\u00a0\nAnd some on the left are actually claiming, well, OK, our allegations didn't work, let's go after Judge Kavanaugh's temperament. That might be disqualifying. They're saying he was just too aggressive when defending himself against false allegations of drugging and gang raping teenage girls.\u00a0\nAsk yourself this question. OK, how would you react if you were falsely accused of rape? Of drugging teenage girls, happened on an every weekend basis, gang raping them, boys lining up in the halls? How would you react? What is the appropriate reaction? How would you react if senators were on national TV calling you evil, comparing you to Bill Cosby, suggesting that you're guilty of serious crimes you never committed?\u00a0\nFar left retired Justice John Paul Stevens weighing in: Oh, this should disqualify him from becoming a justice. This is the same radical former Supreme Court justice that doesn't believe in the Constitution. He once demanded the Second Amendment be repealed, and wrote that the election of George W. Bush violated our Constitution.\u00a0\nAnd just moments ago, Judge Kavanaugh, in an op-ed just will released with \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he eloquently defended himself on the eve of what will be a historic vote. This is a tipping point for this country. He talked about these ridiculous allegations.\u00a0\nHe wrote, quote: After all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded, I was subjected to wrongful, sometimes vicious, allegations. My time in high school and college, more than 30 years ago, has been ridiculously distorted. My wife, my daughters have faced vile and violent threats.\u00a0\nAnd against that backdrop, I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family, my good name, my lifetime of public service. My hearing testimony was forceful and passionate. That is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegations against me.\u00a0\nHe continued: Yes, I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. Well, I know that my tone was sharp, I said a few things I should not have said. He did apologize once in the hearings.\u00a0\nI hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, a husband, a dad, and I testified with five people foremost in my mind: my mom, my dad, my wife, and most of all, my two daughters.\u00a0\nSadly, this kind of common sense and logic and decency from Judge Kavanaugh, it means nothing to the left. How would you respond?\u00a0\nBy the way, it means nothing to their cohorts, their friends, in the mainstream media. You got all the people on the left whining, crying, complaining, those that believe in guilt by accusation -- just doing what they do best today, feigning outrage.\u00a0\nBy the way, when did any of these people on the Judiciary Committee, the snowflakes on the floor of the Senate being taken out all day, did they ever protested Bill Clinton like this? Did they ever stand up for Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones?\u00a0\nOh, that's right, Dianne Feinstein, who recommended Debra Katz -- well, Debra Katz didn't believe in Paula Jones. It was only ten or 12 minutes. So, you have a lot of hypocrisy, feigned, selective moral outrage.\u00a0\nAnd today, you have far left protesters erupting all over Capitol Hill. And as you can imagine, emotions were running high. Logic was running very low. Even sent our own Griff Jenkins down to the middle of all of this in the middle of the mob, asking these people what they thought about due process, the presumption of innocence, the rule of law.\u00a0\nThe answers will stun you, take a look.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a job interview. There is no presumption of innocence in a job interview.\u00a0\nGRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDEN: Do you believe that he was given a fair chance in his confirmation?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A fair chance? This man is sitting amongst friends of his.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clearly, there been enough allegations swirling around that we know that this job application needs to be denied.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The public is the people who should be making decisions about what they need and what they deserve, not the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) rich white man who doesn't give a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) about us.\u00a0\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D\u2014MASS.: In my view, Judge Kavanaugh made it pretty clear that he does not have the judicial temperament, he believes the Supreme Court is just one more political football. That's not what the Supreme Court is about, and I think in that hearing, Judge Kavanaugh disqualified himself.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: No presumption of innocence, no due process. Let me tell you, if that's the case, there's no country, there's no Constitution. It's sad, it's shocking, and it's frankly beyond chilling.\u00a0\nComing up, we are going to have a lot more of Griff, including his full interview with Senator Elizabeth Warren.\u00a0\nToday, she led this horde of demonstrators demanding that Kavanaugh's life and reputation continue to be destroyed without these fundamental beliefs that we as Americans should all share regardless of political orientation. You have to have some corroboration. There's got to be some evidence, some presumption of innocence.\u00a0\nThe only good news tonight is the left -- well, they officially have been officially exposed to the American people. See those protesters? You are looking at the modern radical left Democratic Party, and the media, the party of double standards. The party of smears, lies, character assassinations, family bludgeoning with no plans to offer the hardworking, law-abiding, taxpaying citizens, you, the American who make this country the single greatest, best, last great hope for man on this earth.\u00a0\nLook what they do. The people, that's not the people of this country. That is one party, though sadly, that has abandoned any sense of fundamental decency, fairness, and common sense.\u00a0\nNow, thankfully, you, the American people, it has now awoken a lot of people in this country. Look at this Rasmussen poll on President Trump, it's his highest approval rating ever. According to an NPR poll of all places, remember the Democratic enthusiasm, blue wave edge that they had? It's totally evaporated.\u00a0\nToday, at this hour, we are seeing the chaos, the mayhem, the madness, the insanity. You got the leaders of the Democratic Party, full on assault on the integrity of the FBI. They have so convinced their party activists about guilt upon accusation, that that's fine in America. No due process is fine in America. No presumption of innocence is fine.\u00a0\nHow does that work for you and your family in your life? Slander, smear, character assassination, that's one party in America today. Great job, Dianne Feinstein, Chuckie Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters. Do you want them in power in 33 days?\u00a0\nNow, the American people, now that the people that they're leading causing pandemonium in our nation's capital because their so-called leaders convinced them that guilt by accusation is okay. That defining someone as a rapist, a gang rapist, a drugger of teenage girls without cooperation in America is okay?\u00a0\nWell, those are the tactics of today's radical Democratic Party. This is why, for years, I had pointed this out on the show. This happens every two and four years, and now with every Supreme Court appointment, nearly everyone.\u00a0\nThey disseminated salacious lies about President Trump before and after the election. They advanced a bizarre conspiracy theories that one candidate actually paid for. Hookers urinating in beds, they talk about it as if its truth. They disseminated as propaganda before elections.\u00a0\nThey do it to start up a witch hunt investigation and conspiracy. They call people racist, sexist, misogynist, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, that Republicans, conservatives want dirty air and water. We drink the water and breathe the air. They want children to die.\u00a0\nWell, if you're only going to raise Medicare 7 percent a year, that means you want to throw your own grandmother off the cliff. We hear it every two and four years.\u00a0\nAnd when these vile accusations of drugging, gang raping teenage girls without evidence, that's not to be believed by the FBI, these are the consequences? That's the reaction? Is this the party you want in power? You want to elect these people and 33 days?\u00a0\nLook at your screen. High drama tonight with these four senators. They appear to hold the keys to the Kavanaugh vote.\u00a0\nAre they going to give into this in new America of guilt by accusation, lying, smearing, slander, character bludgeoning? Of the last 17 days. Forget the last 40 years of this man's life.\u00a0\nNo corroboration. Are they going to give into this? Has any of this had any impact on those four senators? Do they believe in the presumption of innocence? That's their question tonight. Do they believe in due process, the rule of law? Do they have common sense and decency?\u00a0\nDo they believe that you've got to have some corroboration? Do they believe in our great Constitution? Or are they going to reward forever the slanderous tactics of the hard left that only want power?\u00a0\nHere with reaction, Fox News investigative reporter Sara Carter, the author of \"The Deep State: How an Army of Bureaucrats Protected Obama and Working to Destroy the Trump Agenda,\" Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz.\u00a0\nSara, let's begin with you.\u00a0\nYou saw this unfold today, it has been building, it looks like it comes down to three Republicans -- Murkowski, Collins, and Flake. And may be Joe Manchin, a Democrat, but I don't think he'll vote for Kavanaugh unless the Republicans have the vote already.\u00a0\nSARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right. Nobody wants to take a guess, Sean, as to what they're going to do. I have been talking to people do, however, on the Hill. And some of them believe that Susan Collins may vote to pass confirmation for Kavanaugh, as well as Manchin. Manchin is up there.\u00a0\nI think one of the interesting things about Manchin is he is in West Virginia. West Virginia where there's a lot of support for President Trump. He is sometimes called a Trump Democrat. So, I think that's what they are going to see here.\u00a0\nLook, Sean, what we are hearing today, what we have seen over this last week, the op-ed that was written by Kavanaugh, I can't believe he didn't go further. Can you imagine going home to your daughters and having to explain --\u00a0\nHANNITY: No.\u00a0\nCARTER: -- to your young daughter why they are calling you a gang rapist? Why people are shredding your name, your good name, that you spent over 30 years building? Pulling out stories that aren't even true?\u00a0\nThe American people are not dumb, Sean. The American people see what is happening here, and now they see the rise of this very frightening left movement.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Well, let me ask -- Congressman, without any corroboration on any of these charges, I don't believe it's profile in courage for these four senators to say he's had a 40-year track record versus 17 days of smears. Everybody else that seems to know -- have known him and know him say just the opposite.\u00a0\nAre they going to give into these tactics? Because if they do, I would argue America is forever changed for the worst.\u00a0\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I hope that three of the four will actually get there. I'm not so sure about Murkowski.\u00a0\nBut I've got to tell you, that Kavanaugh family, they have taken every hit, every cheap shot, every blow, and they are the toughest family that I know of, because everything that has been thrown at them has been so unfair.\u00a0\nI do, I am encouraged by what Collins said today, I was encouraged by what Jeff Flake said. He is on the record of passing them out of committee, and I think he'll hopefully get there. And I think Manchin --\u00a0\nHANNITY: Well, he got what he wanted, Congressman. And he got the FBI corroborating with the Senate Judiciary investigating committee found themselves, and there's nothing else to investigate except talking to the four people. We don't know where it happened, when it happened, what day of the week it happened. We don't know -- there are no forensics in this case.\u00a0\nCARTER: There is just nothing there, Sean. I mean, we talk to people --\u00a0\nCHAFFETZ: There's been seven investigations.\u00a0\nCARTER: Seven -- seven investigations piled high, hundreds of pages. There is nothing there to find. Except we have to stand our ground here.\u00a0\nAnd I'm talking to the journalist here, but also as an American, you are innocent until proven guilty. They should not be allowed -- people should not be allowed to slander another person with no evidence, no corroboration, and try to make that stick. That does not happen in the United States of America. That happens in country like Russia and other places.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Well, we'll find out by Saturday at 5:00 p.m., won't we, Congressman?\u00a0\nCHAFFETZ: Yes, I think ultimately he gets 53 votes and he is the next justice on the Supreme Court.\u00a0\nHANNITY: How many votes?\u00a0\nCHAFFETZ: Fifty-three.\u00a0\nHANNITY: OK.\u00a0\nSara, what do you say?\u00a0\nCARTER: I'm in total agreement that I'm kind of iffy on one of them, but I say 52 for sure, 53 maybe.\u00a0\nHANNITY: All right. We'll see. Thank you both.\u00a0\nWhen we come back, Gregg Jarrett, Kimberley Strassel, Monica Crowley. We have the latest news on the liberal activism caused by liberal leaders, straight ahead.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nGRASSLEY: I would never use the word \"fake news\". I consider you folks a policeman for our democratic system of government. But I want to show you where some of you have bias.\u00a0\nI have demonstrators in my office for two weeks now, both for Kavanaugh and against Kavanaugh. And one time, the people that were for Kavanaugh wanted to be interviewed. And they said, we are only interested in interviewing people against Kavanaugh.\u00a0\nNow, that's a bias that none of you should be proud of.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley criticizing the liberal media for their shameful coverage of the Kavanaugh nomination. As always, usually, one sided.\u00a0\nHere with more reaction, \"Wall Street Journal's\" columnist Kimberley Strassel, senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research, Monica Crowley, author of \"The New York Times\" number one bestseller, \"The Russia Hoax,\" Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett.\u00a0\nKimberley, let me start with you. It's either going to be one way.\u00a0\nIt's either going to be 49 or 52. That's my guess. I don't think there's going to be any middle ground here.\u00a0\nKIMBERLEY STRASSEL, COLUMNIST, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: No, I think that's probably right. And to go to your topic, we know which side the media is rooting for. And this is really disturbing to those of us who started on the news side.\u00a0\nLook, this used to be really simple. There was a divide between opinions and news side reporters. I'm very clear, everything I write, I'm an opinion writer. It is delineated in the newspaper as opinion.\u00a0\nBut on the news side, so many and so many organizations, they don't abide by that rule anymore. They are out there -- and, you now, its' undercutting the journalism industry, which already is one of the least trusted industries out there. But they're, through omission, through misrepresenting a fact, they have chosen a side, and it does not reflect well on anybody.\u00a0\nHANNITY: They have more than chosen a side, Gregg Jarrett. They are now advocates themselves of guilt by accusation. You know, they are not telling their audiences about the lack of corroboration in every case. I am a talk show host. I am a conservative.\u00a0\nAs a talk show host, sometimes we do straight news. We break news, we do investigative reporting. You've been part of our investigative team. Other times, I give strong opinion. I give opening monologues. We're the whole newspaper.\u00a0\nBut they say they are the news division, and they're not. We do everything, we admit up front, like Kimberley said, they do not admit -- they claim to be something they're not.\u00a0\nGREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: There is no shortage of media malpractice in the age of Trump. And this is a perfect example. The mainstream media became witting, willing accessories to character assassination.\u00a0\nThey demonized Kavanaugh, corroborating evidence be damned. They drove this constant narrative that guilt should be assumed and presumed. And that an accuser should never even be question, much less doubted.\u00a0\nThey attacked, at every turn, you know, Kavanaugh's temperament, they attacked his yearbook. They attacked his denial. And it was really a shameful example of how the media has become overwhelmed by its own bias.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Yes. And Monica, I mean, 48 for 52. Not 49, my mouth was off slightly. But to me, this is no profile in courage. If there is no corroboration -- on any case, and just the opposite, the Professor Ford she identified an eyewitness to the alleged crime what she was talking. The eyewitness says it didn't happen.\u00a0\nWhy do so many people from the beginning, they said, we believe her. Well, there is no presumptive innocence there. There is no due process. They made up their mind without hearing anything. And then they are literally hemming and hawing at the FBI tonight. What was the FBI supposed to do beyond that which they did?\u00a0\nMONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, then that's exactly what the Democrats, the left, and the media profess that they wanted, right. A full, thorough FBI investigation then they got one, and of course that wasn't enough.\u00a0\nYou know, Sean, talking about the press, most of the mainstream press has been biased to the left for decades, we've known that. But what's different in the Trump era is the level and intensity of their advocacy and activism.\u00a0\nSo all of the facts that you just laid out there about Dr. Ford's testimony, the lack of corroboration and on substantiation, very little of that has been reported in the mainstream press because now the press is an active and proactive member of the left. And the left is at war for the future of the country.\u00a0\nThey are at war with a Constitution, free market economics, individual liberty. All of the things that Judge Kavanaugh will fight for as a justice on the Supreme Court. Therefore, he must be destroyed and the press is actively doing that.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Why, Kimberley, they have had all day now to look at the FBI report. Why are we still waiting to hear from Murkowski, Collins, Flake, and Manchin?\u00a0\nKIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WRITER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes. I mean, it would be nice if they declared on this so that we can start to put this episode behind us. Look, I think, that they, for the same reasons that they wanted the FBI investigation, it provided them some additional cover to say, that everything has been vetted. They are going to make us wait, I think, until tomorrow morning. Look, almost every other senator has--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Well, we'll know at 10.30 do you think that vote will be the indicator?\u00a0\nSTRASSEL: Well, it will be because -- look, that is -- historically, every time that you have this, that particular vote, that is the indicator. If you vote to move forward, it's essentially a vote for the nominee.\u00a0\nHANNITY: yes.\u00a0\nSTRASSEL: Now and historically, as well, that usually meant you immediately had a final vote. I would wager Democrats are going to try to prolong it as long as they could so their protesters can keep going.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Predections, Kimberley, what do you say?\u00a0\nSTRASSEL: I'm hopeful, I think, that he will be confirmed.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Gregg Jarrett, how is this coming down and why are they waiting?\u00a0\nJARRETT: Well, Jeff Flake wins the Charlie Brown wishy-washy award. So, you know, there is no predicting that. Murkowski and Collins -- their -- they don't have courage. They're waiting to see what the other one does, so who knows?\u00a0\nHANNITY: What you think, Monica?\u00a0\nCROWLEY: I say he gets confirmed by the Clarence Thomas split, 52-48.\u00a0\nHANNITY: All right. Thank you for all being with us. I hope for the sake of fairness and due process that equal justice under the law and the presumption of innocence prevails here.\u00a0\nWhen we come back, more of Griff Jenkins on his exclusive reporting. He went in the middle of a mob earlier today in these protests. We have Dr. Sebastian Gorka and Dan Bongino they're next as we continue to monitor where will this go. Judge Kavanaugh writing in the Wall Street Journal, \"I am an independent and impartial judge,\" this very evening. More next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Earlier today, our own Griff Jenkins spoke with a lot of these crazy protesters at the anti-Kavanaugh rally. By the way, you could really think Chuck and Nancy and Maxine waters and Michael Avenatti for this bizarre well, happening earlier today.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nGRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Do you feel that he was afforded the presumption of innocence?\u00a0\nWARREN: This is a job interview. And the question is about the evidence that's presented and the credibility of her claim.\u00a0\nJENKINS: Do you believe that Judge Kavanaugh had presumption of innocence, got a fair shake in the hearing?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. I think that he didn't give himself a fair share because he lied the entire time.\u00a0\nJENKINS: Do you believe Judge Kavanaugh was given the presumption of innocence?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is this a court of law?\u00a0\nJENKINS: Why do you believe Judge Kavanaugh shouldn't be confirmed?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like he's lied multiple times, and he feels -- he acted crazy.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clearly there has been enough allegations swirling around that we know that this job application needs to be denied.\u00a0\nJENKINS: Judge Kavanaugh was not given his fair presumption of innocence?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that Judge Kavanaugh refused the investigation, right? He did not want it. That is not the behavior of someone who is understand, like, that, as a man, it is his benefit and the country's benefit, to say, let's discover the truth.\u00a0\nJENKINS: Do you believe that he was given a fair chance in his confirmation?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A fair chance? This man is sitting among friends of his.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The public is the people who should be making decisions about what they need and what they deserve, not the (muted) little white man who don't give a (muted) about us.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because her allegations of sexual assault gets him that quite likely are true. I believe they are true, but it hasn't been proven yet one way or another.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a job interview, there is no presumption of innocence in a job interview.\u00a0\nJENKINS: And in your mind, Judge Kavanaugh failed that?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely, he failed the job interview.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is nothing short of a desperate grab by the old, white, male, rich patriarchy.\u00a0\nWARREN: In my view, Judge Kavanaugh made it pretty clear that he does not have the judicial temperament. He believes the Supreme Court is just one more political football. That's not what the Supreme Court is about. And I think, in that hearing, Judge Kavanaugh disqualified himself.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: No presumption of innocence. This confirms everything you need to know about the party of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Michael Avenatti.\u00a0\nHere with reaction, author of the book, \"Why We Fight,\" Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Author of the book \"Spygate,\" former Secret Service agent NRA TV contributor, Dan Bongino.\u00a0\nDr. Gorka, we will begin with you. May be, in ways, regardless of the outcome of the vote, maybe we will now -- maybe the American people, I think these polls show tonight, see what this -- there is one party that doesn't believe in our Constitution.\u00a0\nBasic, fundamental, you know, generational principles that have served us well. They will throw all of that to the wind, guilt by accusation. Mob rule seems to rule the day.\u00a0\nSEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Sean, as the child of parents who suffered as children and then adults under fascism and then communism, I am deadly serious when I say it's people like the people you just showed being interviewed that make dictatorships possible.\u00a0\nThose people are ideologues. They don't care about the truth. This, interesting that three people used the same talking point. It's a job interview, therefore there is no presumption of innocence. Presumption of innocence isn't just in a court of law. It's base -- it's the basis of Anglo-American society, of our civilization.\u00a0\nThe idea that he didn't show the requisite temperament for 31 hours, he showed exactly the temperament that was needed for a Supreme Court justice. And then, when he was slandered, he showed what an innocent man does when you react to being called a serial rapist and accused of attempted murder when he is innocent. These people are frightening.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: And a drugging women systematically almost on a weekly basis. Dan Bongino?\u00a0\nDAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT: You know, Sean, we've crossed the Rubicon here, the other side wants chaos. But here's the problem, Sean. I want your audience and you to smile a little bit tonight.\u00a0\nThe left isn't ready for the storm they think they want, Sean. These people are soft. One of those guys had a man bun. These guys have been and women have been brought as educational institutions, they've been coddled.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: hang on.\u00a0\nBONGINO: They had people kiss their butts.\u00a0\nHANNITY: I don't want to get dragged into one thing. I'm not criticizing. I'm just saying here. I don't want to go after how people look, I want to deal with substance here. The substance is, do you believe in the presumption of innocence? And many on that video said no. I don't care what they dress or how they wear their hair. They said no.\u00a0\nBONGINO: Sean, they want chaos. Chaos is the opposite of due process. What I'm trying to get at here is these people are soft. This entire ideology, that our emotions matter, law, reason, rule of law, none of that matters. They have been coddled.\u00a0\nYou understand, they have been coddled their entire time through college, through their educational institutions. Liberalism has been the default position they're not ready for the fight ahead. We are, we know how to exercise--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: But in 33 days the American people--\u00a0\nBONGINO: Sean.\u00a0\nHANNITY: If you listen to the media, that party of Schumer, the ones that I would argue initiated this belief that Judge Kavanaugh is guilty by accusation, they want power. Nancy Pelosi wants to be speaker, Chuckie wants to be the head of the Senate.\u00a0\nGORKA: But Sean?\u00a0\nHANNITY: Yes, Dr. Gorka?\u00a0\nGORKA: Sean, the American, the sleeping giant has awoken. There are people, millions that have been angered by the way Judge Kavanaugh was treated. And even if they didn't vote for Donald Trump, you can bet they are going to vote Republican in 33 days.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Do believe that, Dan?\u00a0\nBONGINO: I do. I think they've pulled the pin on an electoral grenade, they can't possibly put back in, they may have a little bit of trouble on the House side, but I think the Senate, the Democrats are regretting every minute of this right now.\u00a0\nHANNITY: But remember, if they get the house, and Nancy Pelosi is speaker, Maxine Waters as chair committee, they want to impeach, they want to rescind the tax cuts, they want open borders, eliminate ICE, they want to keep Obamacare. This is just the beginning.\u00a0\nAll right. Thank you both, we have to end there. We appreciate our time. When we come back, we're going to expose more liberal double standards, and why isn't the left in this country demanding an FBI into allegations against Keith Ellison?\u00a0\nDo any of these people ever stick up for Juanita Broaddrick? Well, that's right, the left has selective moral outrage. No FBI investigation for Juanita Broaddrick, Kathlyn Willey, Paula Jones. Interesting.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: So with reaction to the ongoing Kavanaugh nomination saga, president of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, former vice president of the ACLU, Michael Meyers. You saw the ad we played last night, Michael. For what, since 1981 to 2005, you were a member, a high-ranking member of the ACLU?\u00a0\nMICHAEL MEYERS, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, ACLU: I was on the national board, I was with the American Civil Liberty Union, I was also a voting member most of those years on the ACLU national executive's committee.\u00a0\nHANNITY: How do you feel?\u00a0\nMEYERS: I was proudest of the ACLU when the ACLU resisted fascism, when they stood up to the mob. Now the ACLU has become the mob. And it has become what they are not supposed to be. You are supposed to stand up to the mob, it's supposed to stand for freedom and individual liberty, it's supposed to stand for the presumption of innocence.\u00a0\nIt doesn't make -- it doesn't make assumptions. It makes a presumption that a person is presumed to be innocent unless he is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In terms of civil matters, the person is innocent unless there is a preponderance of the evidence. The ACLU now--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: What happened, Michael? What happened to your organization?\u00a0\nMEYERS: The ACLU now is hijacked by the lunatic left. They don't believe in process. They don't believe in due process. They don't believe in free speech anymore. They don't believe in anything other than the resistance. Or rather as opposed to resisting fashion, they have become part of the resistance movement. I\u00a0\nHANNITY: Where does this end, Michael? Does the -- do civil libertarians come back to where you were, or you know, do you now join people like me, which I know will give -- you know, send shock waves through your spine?\u00a0\nMEYERS: Well, let's put it this way. The ACLU has become like the NAACP. Once you lose control of your board, once you do not have civil libertarians on the board, you don't have a civil liberties union organization anymore. And you have people who are bottom-line lunatics in terms of the left.\u00a0\nThey want, quote, unquote, \"justice\" so if a woman encourages a man, the mere accusation is enough for the ACLU. This has never been a principal of civil liberties. You can't accuse somebody and don't expect evidence to show the person is guilty of something. And you can't presume the person is guilty as opposed to innocent.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Michael, there are people like you, Alan Dershowitz in this case, you stand alone and you've been consistent in your views. I've great admiration for both of you on this case. Thank you both -- thank you for being with us.\u00a0\nMEYERS: Thank you.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Joining us now, Keith Ellison's opponent in the race for Minnesota A.G., Doug Wardlow is with us. Doug, you met with the president after he arrived in Minnesota tonight. I heard you're hanging out with my buddy, Michael (Inaudible) Mike. I love the guy, one of my best friends.\u00a0\nWhen the president spoke on this issue Kavanaugh tonight, the reaction, from what I could hear, was one of the loudest of the night. Was that your perception?\u00a0\nDOUG WARDLOW, R, ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE, MINNESOTA: Absolutely right, Sean. You know, people in Minnesota understand that there is a terrible double standard that the Democrats are foisting upon on the country right now.\u00a0\nOn the one hand, they are going after Judge Kavanaugh, who is a good man base on -- and they are doing it base on unsubstantiated allegations. On the other hand, we've got the deputy chair of the DNC, Keith Ellison, my opponent running for attorney general of the State of Minnesota, and there are credible allegations against him by two women, two women. We've got medical records, as well as a witness.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Text messages, doctor's reports.\u00a0\nWARDLOW: Exactly.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Well, is that -- here is my question.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWARDLOW: there text messages. There are doctor's report.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Any member of the Senate judiciary committee called for an FBI investigation on the most powerful man on the Democratic National Committee?\u00a0\nWARDLOW: No, they haven't. No, they haven't. It just reveals the double standard. It reveals that the Democrats they care about power in politics. They don't care about the welfare of women, they don't care about truth or justice. Terrible.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Yes. Will he win in Minnesota? Do you think he--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWARDLOW: No, he is not going to win in Minnesota.\u00a0\nHANNITY: -- may step down but a solo FBI investigation.\u00a0\nWARDLOW: There is no FBI investigation. But we're neck in neck in the polls. You know, in 33 days Minnesotans are going to go to the polls they are going to retire Keith Ellison from politics. It will be a great thing for the nation. I would encourage conservatives all across the country to visit my web site, DougWardlowag.com to join the fight to stop Keith Ellison.\u00a0\nHANNITY: All right. Please send my regards to our mutual friend Mike. And thank you for being with us. All the best 33 days from now.\u00a0\nAll right. So the president was in Minnesota tonight, huge rally there. We got the highlights, we'll play that for you coming up next on this busy breaking news night. Stay with us.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: And speaking of Minnesota, earlier tonight, the president held a rally there. And here are some of the highlights. We haven't been able there so far.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: The only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning. That's really it. Because you are winning. You are winning a lot.\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\u00a0\nTRUMP: There has never been an administration that in already less than two years -- but can you believe? We all did this together? We are coming up on two years. Can you believe it? There has never been an administration with you that's done so much in so little time. Two years. No administration has come close.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Thirty three days from tonight, you, the American people decide if Nancy Pelosi become speaker, Chuck Schumer the Senate Majority Leader, Maxine Waters chairs committee, and Michael Avenatti becomes the new star of the Democratic Party. Should they be rewarded for what they have done? This has been a national disgrace where you don't have the presumption of innocence.\u00a0\nAll right. Thanks for being with us. We'll be back tomorrow night with some more answers. There's going to be a lot. Laura is next. We'll see you tomorrow. Laura?\u00a0Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

            "article_content": "GOP lawmakers grill the deputy attorney general on Capitol Hill on his involvement in the probe. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the target of an impeachment effort being undertaken by conservatives in the U.S. House of Representatives, according to a report. U.S. Reps. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, both members of the House Freedom Caucus, are said to be leading the effort and could submit an impeachment filing in the next few days, Politico reported Friday. Rosenstein has been clashing with some House Republicans for months over requests for Department of Justice documents, the Washington Examiner reported. The deputy AG oversees Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. On Thursday, the New York Times reported that the White House ordered that more members of Congress receive access to classified information about an FBI informant linked to the Russia probe, despite objections from U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials. It was Rosenstein who named Mueller to lead the Trump-Russia probe after Rosenstein\u2019s boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recused himself from the investigation because of Sessions\u2019 own role in the Trump campaign. Politico\u2019s story on the possible impeachment filing against Rosenstein came on the same day that Rosenstein announced Mueller\u2019s 12 indictments against Russian military intelligence officials on charges linked to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Speculation that President Donald Trump might fire Rosenstein increased in April, after FBI agents conducted raids at the office and home of Michael Cohen, the president\u2019s former personal attorney, the Hill reported.",

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" August 29, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Boom. Great job, Rush. All right. Let not your hear be troubled. The news continues. Ingraham, she does radio too. She knows everything. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Oh, hi. Oh, sorry. I was just - (LAUGHTER) HANNITY: Oh, yeah. Why would I watch \"Hannity\" show? What's the point? INGRAHAM: I'm getting ready - Hannity, I'm getting ready for college football. HANNITY: Big time, me, too. INGRAHAM: Can you see what this is? Can I zoom in -- sort of zoom in on this? Yes. HANNITY: I got to tell you one thing. What are you doing -- what is the college? What does it say? INGRAHAM: Alabama, A, roll tide. HANNITY: Wow. Roll tide. INGRAHAM: Only ranked number one of the country. HANNITY: I got to tell you one thing -- I'm now a Saturday football guy. The NFL can fight over the anthem all they want. I'm done. I'm watching Saturday college football. INGRAHAM: No, I love my Redskins. HANNITY: Whatever. INGRAHAM: I'm always one of those Redskin hopefuls, where it's going to win one day again. HANNITY: One day again. I know. I thought they had the best quarterback ever and sadly injuries got to him. INGRAHAM: No. Hannity, when you bring up the football, you are so right because when Alabama came to the White House, Nick Saban shows up - (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Greatest coach ever. No doubt about it. INGRAHAM: The players were there. Every -- I'm sure a lot of people don't like Trump or the players, but they were respectful. They showed up. It was a great event. It was a beautiful day. That's the way it should -- just respect the office. You can have disagreements if not. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Of course, it's nothing political. I agree with you. Let's keep this -- get the politics out of sports, period, agreed. Have a great show. INGRAHAM: All right, Hannity, fantastic show tonight. Great job on the CNN issue. We're going to continue with more of that. Thanks so much. And welcome to Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is 'The Ingraham Angle' on a very busy Wednesday night. Another black eye for CNN. Do they have any other eyes other than black eyes at this point? Now, it's not just those stories they're getting wrong. Now they're defending one of the most violent groups in the country. A former CNN contributor is here to tell us what the heck is going on. Plus some interesting excuses from Catholic leadership as a sexual abuse scandal widens. And what former Trump official is unveiling a new musical off-Broadway? I will give you a hint - it will have a short run. Raymond Arroyo joins us with that and more in Seen and Unseen and some exclusive details from inside that Bruce Ohr hearing yesterday. Former Prosecutor Andy McCarthy is here. But first, far left billionaires uniting to remake America. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Remember when the Democratic Party had a shred of a belief in freedom and democracy? The far left Bernie Sanders contingent used to be existing kind of only on the fringes. While more establishment figures, like Hillary Clinton and so forth, they ran the show. But no more. Big Democratic donors have begun to support some of the hard left socialist candidates that have emerged on the scene recently. Last night's election told us a lot. Top Democratic billionaires, Tom Steyer and George Soros, put their money behind far left Tallahassee mayor, Andrew Gillum, for Florida governor. Defying expectations, he pulled off our primary victory last night against six other candidates. Gillum is the African-American male version of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He's young, he's kind of dynamic, and he's running on a platform of universal Medicare, legalize marijuana, and abolishing ICE. Exciting. And he is viewed by hard left Democrats as kind of a savior from the stranglehold of the party's establishment has had on their desires, hopes, and dreams. They picked the perfect guy. His city hall under investigation, FBI, corruption, and Tallahassee boasting Florida's highest crime rate three years running. Good going, guys. That is something to run on. But let's look at who his supporters are. Of course, many of you will be familiar with George Soros, the billionaire who has funded the Liberal Center for American Progress, moveon.org, and his Open Society Foundation, which spreads money all over the place, globally by the way. In the 2016 campaign cycle, \"The New York Times\" magazine reports that Soros spent $25 million on that loser campaign of Hillary Clinton and other leftist candidates' causes. This year, he's already blown $15 million to support Democratic candidates and other causes. Now, Gillum knew a good deal when he saw it. So last year, he courted Soros' organizations and spoke at a number of their gatherings. Then when they met at San Francisco, Soros promised to back his gubernatorial run. He was impressed with Gillum. Billionaire San Francisco financier and philanthropist, Tom Steyer, also bankrolled Gillum's campaigning and he saw him as basically a new and almost improved version of Obama because he was more left wing. Now, remember, Steyer is the activist who just finished up a 30-city town hall tour. And you know, he is contemplating his own 2020 run for president. That's part of what he's doing here. And he's not letting the grass grow underneath him. Steyer is running as encouraging people to sign a Trump impeachment petition. Steyer himself is kind of the impeachment pitch man. He's openly urging the president's removal from office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM STEYER, AMERICAN BILLIONAIRE: How much more does Congress need to see? Donald Trump has now been implicated in two felony crimes, and he's all but confessed to them on Fox News. No one is above the law. So we have to make sure this president doesn't use pardons to cover up crime. If you agree that a president should not be allowed to pardon himself or his associates, join us at needtoimpeach.com. The Washington establishment doesn't have the courage to act, but the American people can. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I should add that Steyer funneled about $800,000 into the Get Out the Vote initiative prior to the Gillum run. So, he was critical in that Gillum race as well. But listening to that impeachment commercial for a second, he thinks about the Democratic establishment, right? They've tried to keep the impeachment talk at arm's length. Well, what they are really doing is letting the billionaires boys club do their dirty work for them because they know that this mobilizes the far left base, keeps them kind of happy. And it gives Nancy Pelosi, and even Schumer, Swalwell, those types, kind of plausible deniability. That's not us. That's Tom Steyer. And Steyer has promised to spend at least $30 million to elect progressives this campaign season. This means, by the way, that he -- not Soros so far -- is the most important Democratic donor the United States. But like Soros, Steyer is not content to support any Democratic -- anyone who is running, any Democratic establishment person who comes along. His is bankrolling far left radicals who will upend the political system. That's where his mind is. He was at that -- I like the call it the not roots convention -- not roots convention -- all of those far lefties -- I got to -- crash that. It match left. We got to correct that someday, Matt. And they were in New Orleans earlier this summer. Check it out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEYER: How many people in this room think that the Democratic establishment in Washington is listening to you and doing what you want? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: None of them. STEYER: Seriously. They are message to me and the 5.5 million Americans who are demanding Donald Trump's impeachment is that it's bad politics. It is off message and it will galvanize the Republicans. To you and to me and to millions of Americans, this is all pretty obvious. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: He should have worn a hoodie instead of no tie. He's trying to be like a really cool blue-collar guy, no tie, button a shirt. That's weird. If you're going to have it, open it -- button the next button down. It's weird. Sorry. I'm a woman who makes these comments. I have a question, did you think like Maxine Waters is out of town that day? It's like no one was talking about impeachment. Some of them are. Anyway, Steyer is using his billions to ensure the candidacy of these newly minted socialists who he hopes will swamp America, the whole electoral landscape for the Democrats. And Florida is a great place to start because if you can flip Florida, keep it blue or get it back to where they think it should be blue, they think they can take the presidency as well. That's what this is really all about. It's about 2020. But here's the irony, both Soros and Steyer, of course, made all of their dough being aggressive capitalists, global capitalists. Remember, Soros got all that money over in Eastern Europe where the Soviet Union fell, big money, that he shorts the dollar, and then these guys have an inside deal on the hard-core capitalism. But now that they have their billions, they want to spread the gospel of socialism, that's devastating countries like Venezuela. Two million people have left Venezuela, a huge health crisis in Venezuela, and also now in Nicaragua. We have 200,000 who fled Nicaragua. I'm going to tell you more about that story as the weeks go on. Even Europe is beginning to reject the old socialist way. In fact -- this is kind of funny -- George Soros' former protege, Viktor Orban, was just reelected prime minister of Hungary earlier this year and Orban ran against Soros' old buddy. So this is, like, anti-Soros mania. They had big billboards up and he won big in Hungary. The Soros-backed Open Society Foundation, in fact, had to close its Budapest offices less than a month after Orban, his former protege, got re-elected. I love that story. Back here in the United States, it would be so foolish for us, the Republican Party, among conservatives, to just kind of dismiss this as a bunch of billionaires wasting their money. Sometimes they have wasted their money, like on Hillary. But this is not a passing fad. This is a direction the Democrats are going in. They got all these young people. They think socialism is just kind of a social club. They don't know the history of socialism. So conservatives better redouble their efforts to educate the young about the false promises and the dangers of socialism. We know they are not being properly talked about the perils of socialism in the public schools, private schools either for that matter, and the universities. So we have to do it. And we have to commit real dollars to social media campaigns, exposing what socialism is doing, make them cool, make them sexy looking, make them educational. We got to plaster social media with that. And we have to support conservative candidates who are good or great in front of the camera to repel the leftist advance. If we don't act now, you can expect Tom Steyer's impeachment petition to grow, grow longer and longer. And that's \"The Angle\".\" Joining me now for a reaction is Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union; Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and Eric Johnson, attorney and Democratic strategist. All right, Schlapp, let's start with you. I've heard some conservatives kind of -- oh, I hope they do just waste their money. But when you see that Steyer -- it's really Steyer, lesser extent Soros -- Steyer has picked this guy out as the person most likely to push forward the socialist agenda in the state of Florida. That is not an exaggeration. And by golly, he won the primary. MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: It worked, yeah. INGRAHAM: How serious should Republicans take this lurch to the left funded by some of the richest people on the left in America? SCHLAPP: Very serious because one of the things about our campaign laws, Laura, we don't know how much money he spends. You threw some numbers out there. That's just what we have to account for with record-keeping. We don't know what they are spending and they are dead serious that they want to spend their billions to really retake these seats. I think you're right. It's not just about winning these governor races or the Senate races or House races. It's about taking back the White House and completely stopping the Trump agenda. One final thing, the Republican Party's platform is actually pretty popular, but sometimes our leaders are worried to embrace it. The Democrat -- when the American people really know what the Democratic Party is, it is frightening. It is left wing and it is radical. And so, to a certain extent, I'd like to see this completely exposed. INGRAHAM: Yeah. Well, they media are saying that this is -- this is, like, mainstream -- this is more mainstream. This is where the country is. And Victor Davis Hanson, I want to go to you. Soros and Steyer, they made all their money on betting on markets, shorten the markets, going long in the markets, playing all these games in Europe. And now it is, oh, no. We got to bring America back to the failed policies of Europe that are being rejected to the Europeans and have devastated places like Venezuela and now we are seeing what's happening in Nicaragua. Your reaction to all of this? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: I mean Steyer got his wealth in part through investing in coal plants abroad and George Soros was indicted and injected in France and he was responsible for the crisis of the Bank of England. So, they don't have sterling ethical records. But the point is, the Democratic Party of Humphrey, JFK, or even Bill Clinton no longer exists. It's a pyramid with a few grandees on top that have enough money they can be immune from the consequences of their own ideology and then a group on the bottom who depend on subsidies and they have alienated the middle class. A lot of this passion comes from misreading the two elections of Barack Obama. They felt that that was a trajectory that was going to be permanent and create a progressive future. And really, it was unique to Obama and Hillary Clinton inherited all the downsides of losing the middle class under Obama, who, after all, lost the House and Senate in a thousand local races. But she got none of the upside, that is record minority turnout and block voting. And finally, they've so delegitimized Trump or at least attempted to and demonized them, but socialism is sort of -- is portrayed as a legitimate opposition to an abnormal situation. So, we usually -- and America don't like socialists. But if we create enough chaos, analogous to the 2008 election or the Watergate, then socialism looks sober and judicious as a foil. INGRAHAM: OK. The lack of is ignorance. So, Victor, it's what you've written about for years. Matt, you've talked about it. This is in a level of ignorance about basic historical facts subverted in universities, subverted in our high schools, or not taught at all. Eric, you are proud Democrat, and I admire that. If I were Democrat today, while it's exciting to have all this money funneling in, just like the Republicans need suburban women voters, Democrats need the American middle class to return to the Democrat Party as sympathetic to their cause. How does socialism answer the concerns of blue-collar America? ERIC JOHNSON, CIVIL AND CRIMINAL ATTORNEY: Laura, the question is, if you it is all socialism then it's something that's - (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: No, they're talking about -- no, no, Eric, they are calling it socialism. What are you talking about? JOHNSON: No, that is -- they are not necessarily calling it socialism -- INGRAHAM: Ocasio-Cortez does. (CROSSTALK) JOHNSON: I think that's more of a -- no, no, not really. The thing is, if you want to label it -- INGRAHAM: Yes, she is. JOHNSON: -- many people can label some of the -- many people can label some of the things on the right as being sort of corporate autocracy or oligarchy and not for the American people. So the way you want to choose and put down these labels of the political system determines the political -- determines the public opinion on these particular subjects. Now, if you look at the donations, what Soros and what the other individual is doing is nothing different than what the Koch brothers have been doing for years for the Republican Party, feeding their money into these -- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: No, no. I agree with you on that. I'm not disagreeing with you. Let's stick on the issues where we want -- advance the narrative. You are right. JOHNSON: Laura, the question is - INGRAHAM: Koch brothers spent a lot of money on local races. I'm not saying they can't spend their money. What I'm talking about -- JOHNSON: What the question is, you are labeling it - INGRAHAM: It's because - (CROSSTALK) JOHNSON: You're labeling it as socialism. INGRAHAM: Eric, you have to know what your own people is saying. Ocasio- Cortez says socialism is part of me, part of what I represent. Bernie Sanders did not run away from the socialist label. And this Andrew Gillum in Florida is for Medicare -- free Medicare, free healthcare for all -- most socialist countries have that -- abolish ICE, OK, no bordering. We're going to have no enforcement mechanisms to return people to their home countries -- (CROSSTALK) JOHNSON: Well, I want to say -- no enforcement mechanism, I would say that is different than the way that has been implemented right now. I don't believe he said open the borders total -- INGRAHAM: Yeah. Effective. So, we're not going to have effective -- JOHNSON: Well, I mean, right now, it's not necessarily as effective as it is, but it can be done in such a way that is protecting the borders but also protecting those individuals who are here and proper citizens in this country and those who are taking the proper steps to become citizens in this country. INGRAHAM: All I can say -- all I can say for all you guys -- and we got to go to our next block -- but Barack Obama was called a disappointment by George Soros, the big \"New York Times\" magazine piece. He said Obama disappointed him because he didn't consult him enough. Obama wasn't socialist enough for Soros. Soros wants to move -- open society is really about open borders. That is what it is, no borders, no restriction on movement, sovereignty is out the window, all those principles we hold dear as Americans, they are subverted in that world. And I don't see how it's great for the Democrat Party, I don't think it's great for the country. But look, that's where it's going. SCHLAPP: Hasn't been so good for Venezuela either. INGRAHAM: No, it's not so good. Speaking of Venezuela -- thank you for raising that. We had to go guys. Thank you for the incredible panel. We had a somewhat related topic here. Giancarlo Sopo is a Democrat. He is the son of parents who fled Castro's Cuba. And in the \"USA Today\" op-ed, he is warning the party against embracing what we just discussed, Democratic socialism. He wrote, \"Given the horrific record of human suffering, it would be a moral disgrace for Democrats to embrace socialism just to win elections as some suggest.\" Giancarlo joined us now. We're happy to have him. Giancarlo, you heard the conversation. Schlapp and Victor Davis Hanson saying, warning, history tells us like a flashing morning sign, do not go down this path. They were embracing Democratic socialism. I don't care what they're trying to calling it, but they're embracing it. Your reaction? GIANCARLO SOPO, COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT: Well, look, I mean the socialists love poor people so much that they duplicate them by the millions. So, that's a philosophy of failure and it's a moral disgrace, like I said in my op-ed. What has happened in countries like Cuba and countries like Venezuela are human disasters. Thousands and thousands of Cubans have died at sea trying to flee socialism, trying to come to the United States of America. You have Venezuelans, 2 million have left their country in the last three years alone. And so, what you're seeing is a mass exodus away from socialism, yet they are some -- I want to be clear, I think most Democrats are honorable, good people. But I think there are some within the party that are trying to infiltrate democratic socialism and they are trying to confuse people by making them think that it is what the system that they have in Denmark. It is not what they have in Denmark. Denmark is a free-market capitalist country. What groups like the Democratic socialists of America are proposing are -- it's like ideological counterparts of what you see in Havana and in Caracas. INGRAHAM: I mean, how long will you stay a Democrat though, honestly? You're going to stay a Democrat if this is where the juice ends up? If this is where it ends up, all the excitement is in the Democratic socialist movement, I mean, we want you to become a Republican. We want you to become -- you are a common sense guy. Your party is going crazy. Crazy left. Wrap it up it up. SOPO: Well, look, what I got to tell you is that the party of John F. Kennedy cannot become the party of Karl Marx, right? What we are seeing, what's happening now because of some people -- not all -- but because of some, is that a few years ago we are seeing -- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: And they should denounce it. Right. SOPO: Yes. They should denounce it. Absolutely. INGRAHAM: We're out of -- I want to have you on an extended conversation on radio about this. It's fascinating. Republicans have their own challenges. This is a critical conversation and will have you back. Thank you so much. Up next, CNN embarrassing itself once again. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: So, it wasn't enough for CNN to quadruple the number of dubious Trump Tower story, you know, the one that use Lanny Davis as a primary source. Well, they're now defending Antifa. CNN's senior legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin, I thought he was a lot smarter than this, reacting to the president's warning that liberals will violently turn back his agenda if Republicans lose in November. He specifically mentions Antifa. (END VIDEO CLIP) JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Let's be clear also about what is going on here. The theme here is I'm Donald Trump and I'll protect you from the scary black people. Antifa is widely perceived of as an African- American organization. This is about black versus white. This is about Donald Trump's appeal to racism, and it just happens all the time and we never say it -- we don't say it enough for what it is, but that is what is going on. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I got to say, these are the faces of Antifa. OK? Here are some of the lovelies that were arrested recently -- the Berkeley deal. Does this look like an oppressed black organization to you? I mean it's mostly liberal white kids in scarves, headscarves. It's Toobin's ham-handed attack on the president wasn't bad enough, though, anchor Don Lemon chose to defend them altogether. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Listen, there is -- no organization is perfect. There are some violence. No one condones the violence. But there are different reasons for antifa and for these neo-nazis to be there, one, racist, fascist, the other group fighting racist fascist. There is a -- fascist -- there is a distinction there. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: They say no organization is perfect? There's a lot of moments where you just can't believe this is happening in our country. But joining me now with their reactions to what's going on over at CNN, Jeffrey Lord, former Reagan official who once worked as a CNN contributor; and Chip Franklin, national talk show host and media commentator. Jeffrey Lord, let's start with you. You worked at CNN. I got to say I played Toobin bite on the radio this morning. I had to have my guys play that again. I said I don't -- I never in my life thought of antifa as a black organization. It is mostly the anti-WTO crowd, right, they occupy Wall Street crowd, overwhelmingly white, probably most of them privileged liberals. JEFFREY LORD, AMERICAN SPECTATOR CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Correct. I know most of these people over there and I like them enormously. I heard that this morning, and I almost fell out of my chair sitting in the living room. I mean, what are they smoking? I mean, this is just unbelievable to me. All you have to do is do what I can't see, but what I assume you just noticed show some pictures here. Pay attention to these folks. Not to mention these folks are out and out fascists. I mean, they should drop the anti-and just call it fa. I mean this is a bad group of people. They are into violence, they are into hurting people, they have no business in the American dialogue, period. And for CNN to be lending them support is mind- boggling. INGRAHAM: Chip, the president today expanded on the comments about violence and he said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF America: I just hope there won't be violence. I can tell you that -- I can tell you that because that's the way I guess if you look at what happens there's a lot of -- there's a lot of unnecessary violence all over the world but also in this country and I don't want to see it. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: He doesn't want to see violence. So, when you see those pictures, the video from Berkeley, the Trump supporters getting bashed in the head, smashing windows every time a conservative speaks on college campus or if they are upset about taking over ICE. It's just craziness. How was this a racial issue on the part of CNN? CHIP FRANKLIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, that's really selective, Laura, for starters. By the way, Lemon said -- and you didn't have this in the quote -- he said there are racist and fascists and one-sided and there are good people on the other, like in Charlottesville. Cornel West told me if it weren't for Antifa, if they hadn't been there, if Antifa had not protected them, they would have been crushed like cockroaches. Look. This country is built on violence. And this president you just played, he is a guy that set the climate. He is the guy that told the NRA they could shoot Hillary. He is a guy that told cops, why do you put the prisoners in cars and not bang their heads when -- why do you lower their heads? He also said this is a nation that if come in protest, we'll take care of the protests. He said -- INGRAHAM: I get you. So, you just recited, which is very familiar, the liberal -- FRANKLIN: I didn't recite anything. LORD: I got to -- I got to ask - (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: What -- you recited the liberal talking points and you deflected my point. My point is a very simple one. Don Lemon -- hold on, Jeff -- Don Lemon made a distinction, and he made the distinction by saying that Antifa was, in fact, an organization that was kind of -- its own way standing up for what is right. And I'm paraphrasing it. There is no difference there whether there is -- (CROSSTALK) FRANKLIN: Well, it's a grassroots organization by a lot of people. INGRAHAM: What? FRANKLIN: That it's the grassroots organization of a lot of people who are -- look, this country is built on violence, 300 million guns in this country, they go and they show up. Charlottesville is a classic example. They show up to stop racists. This president says, oh, there is good and bad on both sides. INGRAHAM: Well, we played video, Jeffrey Lord, of Antifa chasing down a car after the latest protest in Washington when 24 white nationalists showed up in D.C. You got people menacing -- just regular people driving down the road. So, what I'm talking about is how great the Antifa people were -- FRANKLIN: I'm not saying there great. I'm saying -- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: They are thugs and domestic terrorists. Jeffrey? FRANKLIN: Oh -- and the Charlottesville all right -- LORD: The American left -- wait a minute. Wait a minute. FRANKLIN: The Bannon -- the people -- no, you wait. Trump was the one encouraging that - (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Now, Bannon wasn't in Charlottesville, Chip. Don't sell that garbage on this show. Come on. FRANKLIN: No, but -- LORD: Chip. FRANKLIN: It's not garbage. You know what? The one-sided approach you add to this, the people on the right that are con for violence. Trump said, he said if the midterms go the Democrats way, there's going to be violence. You don't find a problem with that? That doesn't bother you. INGRAHAM: You go back to Charlottesville -- we have Antifa all across the country. Charlottesville has been condemned, including by the president. FRANKLIN: They don't have a central organization. These are people standing up against the kind of violence that you are propagating. INGRAHAM: They are standing for chaos and anarchy. Jeffrey? LORD\": Laura, in 1968 Donald Trump was, what, about 18-years-old or something like that? Where was he when the Democrats were under siege that their own Democratic convention by leftist protesters? Donald Trump was nowhere near these WTO protests. He was nowhere near when they were smashing windows -- FRANKLIN: Seriously, you're going back to '68? Mayor Daley is dead. Let's talk about today. LORD: You're telling me this is Donald Trump's fault? You're telling me this is Donald Trump's fault? This is in the left, violence is in the DNA of the American left, and always has been. FRANKLIN: You are high. Look, if this president comes out every day and calls for violence against people who disagree with his administration -- INGRAHAM: What? He comes out every day -- he just said, we got to tamp down on the violence, it's not good in this country, and we can't stand for it. We just literally played the soundbite, Chip. And you come out and say that you should work for CNN. God bless you, but we just played the sound bite work Trump said no violence. And you say the president -- FRANKLIN: This is a guy that lies. He's lied to 3,000 times in the year and half, and you're going to take one sound bite and say that exemplifies this president? Come on. You've got to be honest with yourselves. INGRAHAM: I think, again, if the Democrats want to appeal to people in the middle who they need, and Republicans have their own set of challenges, you got to be very careful who is running the show on the protest front. And that applies to Charlottesville and it applies to Antifa. Great conversation. Mounting calls to the Pope to resign. We'll tell you about it, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: It's time for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we unravel some of the big cultural stories of the day. Tonight we have Me Too comeback, a Trump musical, and a cardinal dismissing the sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. I'm joined by Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor, \"New York Times\" bestselling author of the fantastic \"Will Wilder\" series. Raymond, the Me Too movement claimed a lot of careers, but now it seems like comedian Louis C.K., he was out. He's a big Trump basher by the way, and now he's in. RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: FX, HBO, Netflix, they all canned him. You remember he exposed himself to women, sexual, inappropriate actions. He left. He apologized, though, Laura. Now he is staging a comeback. And in New York the other day, he did a 15-minute set at a little comedy club on the east side. And people are complaining, particularly victims, saying it's too early, you shouldn't have come back. This is a little taste of his comedy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LOUIS C.K., COMEDIAN: I'm the guy that women see and they go uh. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: And they are still going uh. And now Matt Lauer of \"Today\" show fame, he talked to some fans at a restaurant, it was reported in page six this week. He said, I'm going to back on TV soon. Matt Lauer had a list as long as my arm off accusations against him. The question is how long do you have to stay in Me Too purgatory? My sense is, you have to have a public contrition. You need to be called out and shamed publicly, I think. But then it's up to the audience. These guys can put their toes in the water and see if the audience will accept them. My guess is they want. The scandal is bigger. INGRAHAM: Matt Lauer, a lot of the blue hairs were going up to him -- Matt, I love you and Willard Scott. You were great with Willard. They're the glory days. We like the Smuckers segment. ARROYO: Where's Bryant? (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: Looking for Bryant Gumbel and Katie. I've got to tell you about a new off-Broadway musical that was unveiled the other day by a former, it's very brief, White House official. He introduced the cast of a new Trump musical at a New York press conference. I wish I were making this up. Here's Anthony Scaramucci. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: It just is great fun. My stock answer is I always wanted a second White House press conference, and I couldn't get one, because I only lasted 11 days. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: So he introduced this cast, who are playing members of the Trump family. I will set this up very quickly. This is kind of like an Osmond special, Trump family is gathering, but daddy Trump doesn't show up. So Ivanka has to assume the role as hostess. And what does the family do when data is detained? They sing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (SINGING) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh, my God. ARROYO: That is so lousy. INGRAHAM: Did Anthony Scaramucci, who's been very nasty, by the way, to me, very nasty, even though he sat where you set a couple of times, not anytime soon, but did he have some creative -- was he better at producing or being involved in this than he was as five seconds as press secretary? ARROYO: I think they just hired him to promote this thing. But why? It's so embarrassing. It's like a guy -- INGRAHAM: First of all, why is Ivana back? God bless her, Ivana is not a fat woman. ARROYO: I will only go see this win the Mooch and Omarosa are fill-ins. When they come into the cast, I'll be there. INGRAHAM: This weekend a former Vatican diplomat charged that the Pope and several bishops worked to conceal and protect sexual abusers in the Catholic Church. Chicago Archbishop Cardinal Blase Cupich told the local NBC affiliate of the Pope is just too busy for all this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARDINAL BLASE J. CUPICH ARCHBISHOP OF CHICAGO: The Pope has a bigger agenda. He's got on to other things, talking about the environment and protecting migrants and carrying on the work of the church. We're not going to go down a rabbit hole on this. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: So wait a minute, charges that there are corruption and a culture of silence at the very upper echelons of the church, that is a rabbit hole, that affects victims today and victims to come? I don't think so. INGRAHAM: Let me just tell you, that Cupich comment was disgusting, dismissive, and revealing of how far left the Catholic Church has gone. ARROYO: I can top it. He said, here's the real reason that we are seeing this resistance to Pope Francis and these accusations. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARDINAL BLASE J. CUPICH ARCHBISHOP OF CHICAGO: Quite frankly, they also don't like him because he's a Latino. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: What? ARROYO: They don't like him because he's Latino. Bergoglio is full- blooded Italian who grew up in Argentina. So I am more Latino than him. But I don't know if we're going to have time. There was a cheer that went up today at the Papal event, the Wednesday audience in Rome, and some people thought they were yelling \"Vigano,\" who is the archbishop that made this -- INGRAHAM: Accusations that the Pope knew about McCarrick's sleeping the seminarians deal. Let's watch the audience. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CHANTING) (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: There is some dispute as to whether this is actually Vigano. There was a bishop on the stage with the Pope. His name is Italio. And they're saying this is a crowd of kids yelling Italio, Italio. Some friends who I knew were they, they claim that it was a blend of things. INGRAHAM: It started Italio. ARROYO: It ended Vigano. INGRAHAM: This is like that viral thing. What was it? ARROYO: Yanni or Laurel? INGRAHAM: Yanni or Laurel? Vigano or Italio? ARROYO: You be the judge. INGRAHAM: We won't, except when I listened to it, sounds like Vigano to me. What is that telling the Pope up there, what is it telling him? ARROYO: Let me tell you, he is, according to reports, embittered by this, but he hasn't said anything. People are crying -- INGRAHAM: Guess what Vigano said. He said I am completely serene and at peace because I said the truth. As President Trump launches a new offensive against the DOJ's Bruce Ohr, we have new info tonight about what Mr. Ohr revealed during his closed-door testimony, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: President Trump took another shot earlier today at Bruce Ohr, that DOJ official thought to be behind the politically charged Steele dossier, tweeting, \"How the hell is Bruce Ohr still employed at the Justice Department? Disgraceful. Witch hunt.\" I happen to agree. We have now learned some inside details of what happened to Mr. Ohr when he testified behind closed doors yesterday. Joining me now to explain is former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy. With me here in the studio, former DOJ attorney James Trusty. Andy, let's start with you. What can we conclude now about Ohr? Then we're going to move on to the Sessions and the Donald McGahn issue. ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Apparently, Laura, Ohr is cooperating with the Congressional committees, and I think the most intriguing thing we heard was that he provided the names of a number of people who were in the loop in terms of what he was doing in communications with Steele. He was in communication with Christopher Steele, who is the author of the dossier, throughout the period of time that the dossier was being written and compiled by Steele, and it seems that Ohr is an important person because he's really at the nexus of the Fusion GPS and the Justice Department, FBI side of what I think is actually the most interesting collusion we have seen so far. INGRAHAM: You've written a great stuff about what the real collusion is here. And James, it is wild that we don't have any indication that Bruce Ohr was -- either he wasn't revealing that his wife was a Fusion GPS person to any of his superiors, or they didn't care. Meanwhile, meeting with Christopher Steele, and now apparently seeing a widening circle of people involved in this. What is your initial take on this? JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER DOJ ATTORNEY: The whole thing is amazing. And at some point, the disclosure about where his wife is working obviously should have made its way through the channels. But I think that the whole circumstance of sitting down from his position with Christopher Steele a dozen times, with the FBI taking notes and creating a report, is just unheard of. I have to think, we'll find out eventually maybe, but I have to think it's freelancing, that he's on his own frolicking detour with the FBI, with nobody supervising, nobody looking at it, and we all find out -- INGRAHAM: We don't know, we don't know, though, do we? This went into 2017 with his having these conversations. This was proceeding past the election. TRUSTY: Sure. INGRAHAM: And we know about the insurance policy that they needed. That was discussed by Stzrok. They are freaking out that Trump is president. This is all they got, they got this dossier. They've got to keep this thing going, keep this thing going in order to get the surveillance to continue, the FISA warrant to continue against poor old Carter Page, the affable Carter Page, a sweet guy. But the whole thing, it's like, we've got to hold onto something. Christopher Steele, we are not supposed to talk to him because he's already talking to the media, the explicitly axed him out, but I can still have these backchannel conversations with him. That can't be ethical, is it? TRUSTY: You can't, no. INGRAHAM: Crazy. How is he working in the Justice Department still, by the way? TRUSTY: Let me say this. When you are the Department of Justice, I was there for a long time, Andy was there for a long time, in main justice, although there some wonderful people that work in international affairs that choose to work there, there is no bigger sign of purgatory then being sent there against your will. So the fact that Bruce Ohr is an international affairs means that he is not an favored status. He's hanging by a thread. The cumbersome process of discharging a federal employee is very long, but that's a clear sign that he is not in cahoots or in step with the leadership there. They are not looking to keep them there. INGRAHAM: Andy, let's talk about where we are with the Jeff Sessions in and Jeff Sessions out of favor at the White House. Democrats are now kind of rushing -- sometimes with Jeff Sessions, they don't like him on any policy, but you get the sense that if Trump is mad at Jeff Sessions, Democrats want to embrace Sessions. What is happening there? MCCARTHY: It's hard to know, Laura, because in terms of what we are talking about tonight, we haven't seen anything happening. Sometime ago, the attorney general -- this is months ago -- said that he was referring this sort of investigation of the investigators to both the inspector general at the Justice Department, Mike Horowitz, and also to John Huber, the United States attorney for the district of Utah, who is supposed to be taking an independent look at this, as if he were a special counsel but one who is in house in the Justice Department rather than brought in from outside, like Robert Mueller. That all sounds great. In fact, it is along the lines of what I and a number of other people recommended. The bizarre thing is we haven't heard a thing about it. And I'm all for investigative integrity and investigative secrecy, but at a certain point I think we are entitled to know what are they looking at, what have they come up with, and can we get some kind of an interim report of where they're at. We haven't heard a word. INGRAHAM: Ben Sasse, quickly, James, said he's not going to push to confirm any replacement for Jeff Sessions. The never Trump people, they keep creating a narrative we've got to protect Mueller, special counsel, we've got to protect Rosenstein, we've got to protect Sessions. I never heard these people more willing to protect Republicans in my life. TRUSTY: It is unusual stretch. How often have we seen a president basically publicly ridiculing the attorney general and the deputy attorney general? We are pretty far removed from John and Robert Kennedy at this point. But the bottom line if it is, the president is entitled to have faith in the people that he puts in those positions. He clearly has problems with him. What I think is kind of interesting is you're starting to see little bits of backlash in very subtle ways from either the attorney general or the DAG, where they are getting very fatalistic, the deputy attorney general. They've just being very fatalistic. If you are going to fire me, fire me, and that's kind of the tone they are taking. But they are still chugging along and doing their business. So a lot of politics do it, but in terms of the day-to-day operations of the department, I think it is going to keep going. INGRAHAM: Andy, does Don McGahn, his apparent departure after the confirmation of Kavanaugh it looks like, anything big that we should know there? MCCARTHY: Laura, I really don't think so. For myself, I've heard this was going to happen for months, and I have much less good sources than you all down in Washington have. So it doesn't seem to me like -- INGRAHAM: They're freaking out about this all day long. So I figured Andy McCarthy would set us straight. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Now we have some horrifying revelations out of rural New Mexico in that horrible case there that the media is not showing you. According to the most recent evidence, the Wahhaj family has been using their compound as a terrorist training camp for the 11 children they were holding. Agents found these handwritten letters titled \"Phases of a terrorist attack,\" which detail the steps to a successful suicide attack in the name of Allah, yes, in the United States of America. Despite all of that, a judge in New Mexico today decided to release three of the five defendants, ruling authorities violated the state's 10-day rule. How do you botch that? Andy McCarthy is back with us. I'm so glad you stayed, Andy, because this also has an interesting connection to the case that you worked on, the '93 World Trade Center bombing. We're going to get to that in a moment. But explain how we could get to this place where three of the five defendants are released. MCCARTHY: While, Laura, they made these arrests a couple of weeks ago, and I guess they have been investigating since, and they have gotten to the point where they either have to charge them and an indictment or go through what they call a probable cause or a preliminary hearing. And what I sense happens was they decided that two of these characters were the ringleaders, and they appear to have ratcheted up the charges on the two of them. And then decided perhaps that they couldn't make the case and the other three, so they didn't go forward on those. That doesn't mean that they can't at some future time indict them, but that seems unlikely to me. INGRAHAM: I guess, it doesn't matter if they are flight risk because they are not charged with anything. But that is the concern obviously. Right? MCCARTHY: Right. They had already been sprung on bail to begin with, which was I think in some ways more outrageous than what happened today, because if what happened today they didn't have enough evidence to go forward that's one thing. But letting any of them out I think is insane. INGRAHAM: Can you explain -- the whole thing drives me -- this whole case is so hideous, what was done to their children, one dead. But Andy, explain your connection, I've got a minute left, to this case and the '93 World Trade Center bombing. MCCARTHY: Laura, the father of the ringleader runs a fairly notorious mosque in Brooklyn. His name is also Siraj Wahhaj, and that mosque hosted the blind sheikh who I prosecuted in the early 1990s in connections with the World Trade Center bombing and a plot to bomb New York City landmarks. He actually appeared, that is, the eldest, Siraj Wahhaj, as a character witness for the defendants in the trial. So we are seeing a guy who was enmeshed in this ideology back when, and here you have the results of it. INGRAHAM: We are welcoming this into the United States apparently. And then releasing people back into the system. I don't have a good feeling about this at all. Andy McCarthy, thank you so much for your insights, as always, so appreciated. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Raymond and I are going back and forth. Is it Italo or Vigano? ARROYO: Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CHANTING) (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Now I kind of hear Vigano. I kind of hear Vigano. INGRAHAM: Vigano is the archbishop accusing the Pope about McCarrick. ARROYO: Right. And Italio is a bishop that was standing next to the Pope at the Wednesday -- INGRAHAM: I'll say the Vatican tonight I bet is saying it's Italio. They don't want that archbishop's name to be shouted, the papal audience. What's causing trouble now over the Vatican? I think -- we out-troubled (ph) the cause (ph) here. Shannon Bream, by the way, and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team do not cause trouble. They just do a great show every night. And I watch every night before I go to sleep. Shannon?

            "article_content": "Fox & Trends with Carley Shimkus. Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 the New York congressional candidate many in the media have fallen in love with \u2013 was handed rejection when many of the candidates she endorsed lost in Tuesday\u2019s elections. But her radical and totally impractical ideas continue to pose a threat. The 28-year-old candidate advocates for guaranteed federal jobs, free college for all, Medicare for all, and the abolishment of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. She\u2019d like to turn Uncle Sam into Santa Claus, handing out freebies 365 days a year \u2013 all paid for by crushing taxes on all of us, a skyrocketing national debt or \u2026 hey, whatever. The surprising primary victory that turned this grossly unqualified and woefully uninformed young woman into a candidate likely to be elected to Congress in a heavily Democratic district shows that the real battleground this election cycle is in the classroom. If we continue to laugh off Ocasio-Cortez as an ignorant and delusional radical, we will be blindsided by the soon-to-be largest voting bloc in America \u2013 a generation of indoctrinated millennials. As a fellow millennial, I know firsthand that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s college experience probably taught her that being a socialist absolves her of knowing much at all. All she needs to know is that anyone who opposes her is evil. And she needs to memorize a few bumper sticker slogans about the cruel and greedy 1 percent who aren't \u201cpaying their fair share.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez is among the majority of millennials who now say they would prefer to live in a socialist or communist country over a capitalist one. That\u2019s a troubling revelation to older generations. But can young people be blamed for having no memory of the widespread failures of socialism and communism if we never learned about them? Each year, more and more schools are doing away with basic economics and history courses and\u00a0replacing them with anti-American, progressive propaganda. A survey by U.S. News & World Report found that 53 out of the 76 \u201cbest\u201d colleges and universities in America no longer require history majors to take a single course on U.S. history. Meanwhile, the Communist Manifesto is among the three most frequently assigned readings at American universities and Karl Marx is the most studied economist. Never mind that his economic ideas make about as much sense as the economic theories of Groucho Marx. Campuses across the country are creating a breeding ground for an entire generation of socialist-embracing voters. The University of Massachusetts currently offers a course on \u201cresistance\u201d to capitalism. California State University recently held a \u201cteach-in\u201d charging that America was \"built on a racist capitalist system, meant to weaken the minority.\" At Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s alma mater, Boston University, only three out of the 49 outside speakers invited to the campus last year were identifiably conservative. This is the same school that hosted a panel on the premise that Israel and America are \u201cfascist states.\u201d It's almost as if Ocasio-Cortez used those panel notes to prepare for her cringe-worthy \u201cFiring Line\u201d interview, where she slammed Israel as an oppressor and then backtracked in embarrassment when asked to elaborate. \"I\u2019m not the expert on geopolitics on this issue,\" admitted the recent college graduate. No argument on that point. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez is \u201cnot the expert\u201d on most of the issues she will have to deal with when she likely becomes a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in January. But did anyone expect her to be? Today\u2019s college students spend an average of just under three hours a day on education-related activities. They are learning significantly less than college students did years ago, and the little that they do learn is taught through a progressive lens that often gives them a warped perspective of reality. They learn how to memorize talking points and slogans \u2013 but if you ask them to dive in and explain what they\u2019re saying they can\u2019t, because there\u2019s no substance. So long as they are virtuously fighting the hateful and the cruel, their grades remain high and they are never challenged to explain the validity of their opinions. As a result, we see an entire generation quick to adopt socialism, but slow to define what it is or what it looks like throughout history. They\u2019re simply clueless. \u201cI think my strength is I\u2019m honest and authentic,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah. To understand the mind of a millennial is to understand that he or she believes virtues like these absolve you from needing to possess any real knowledge. This is why we see radical ideas that fall apart on close examination becoming mainstream. The problem is that the millennials never give socialism a close examination. Universities have been held unaccountable for far too long and their agenda is now coming to fruition on a national platform. In 2016, a Cornell University history professor was filmed telling students that \u201ccapitalism is an anti-human system,\u201d and then urging them to build a grassroots movement to \u201cdefeat capitalism altogether because it\u2019s not going to happen at the ballot box.\u201d Fast-forward two years to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s upset primary victory over 10-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in New York and you find that it is in fact happening at the ballot box. This should be a wake-up call for Americans to stop writing off millennials as a hopeless generation of bleeding-heart Bernie-lovers. With a continuation of far-far left indoctrination in our schools and colleges, the American Dream might be replaced by a nightmare. Crazy as it sounds, some people are even talking about Ocasio-Cortez running for president someday. Will America put her in the White House with the slogan \u201cMake America Socialist?\u201d If the majority of millennials truly embrace socialism, candidates like Ocasio-Cortez are only one successful voter registration drive away from getting elected to our highest offices. And if that happens, we and future generations will get to experience the nightmare of economic failure and lack of freedom that the citizens of Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, the Soviet Union, East Germany and other socialist and communist states have suffered through.",

            "article_content": "Mark Levin sits down for an in-depth conversation with Tom Coburn and Mark Meckler to discuss the Convention of States project as well as the state of American politics today. This is a rush transcript from \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" August 19, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARK LEVIN, HOST: Hello America, I'm Mark Levin. This is \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" I have two great guests. Mr. Mark Meckler. How are you? MARK MECKLER, CONVENTION OF STATES PRESIDENT: Good to see you. LEVIN: Dr. Tom Coburn, how are you? FORMER SEN. THOMAS COBURN, R-OKLA.: Great to see you. Great to be with you. LEVIN: You're two patriots. You come from different backgrounds. You're California, you're Oklahoma. You're a doctor, you served in the House of Representatives, you served in the United States Senate, before that, you were a businessman and you decided to become a physician. You've been a lawyer for some time, a businessman also and a political activist. You helped start the Tea Party Patriots and now, you've decided, \"You know what? We've got to do something about the growth of government and the nation seems so unmoored from our constitutional system.\" Dr. Coburn, you're elected to the Senate and then you said, \"That's enough.\" Tell us about that. COBURN: Well, Mark, I spent ten years in the United States Senate, following the enumerated powers, what our Constitution laid out for us, and I actually sent letters every year to every senator saying I'm going to block whatever you do if you don't do that. In that ten years, I was able to do some positive things, but not near what is necessary, and I came to the conclusion after 10 years that what's wrong with the country isn't going to get fixed by the career politicians and the Senate or the House because we have abandoned the core principles of the enumerated powers and we have this ever expansive government that is limiting our freedom, that are also sacrificing the future of our kids because we've mortgaged their future. And so I left looking for another method with which we can cheat history and not be a republic that falls because we didn't continue with the principles - the foundational principles that we had. LEVIN: What are the issues that you think will cause this republic to fall? COBURN: Oh, several. One, the lack of virtue that's been promoted in the public education system. Number two, the debt. Number three, the unfunded liabilities, and number four, the abandonment of the rule of law. And if you go read the history on other republics, we're doing exactly what they did that caused their own collapse, and we're repeating it. And you just had noticed this week that the Treasury is going to borrow another three-quarter trillion dollars more this year than they did last year. At some point in time, somebody is not going to loan us the money and then the game is up, and the consequences are terrible for our kids. LEVIN: Republicans control Congress. COBURN: Yes. LEVIN: You used to campaign as fiscal conservatives, at least, you would say, \"Well, don't focus on the social issues. Let's at least focus on the financial and fiscal issues.\" What's happened? COBURN: Well, I think that's a natural consequences of career politicians. I mean, if you look at the people who vote against all this stuff, they're not the career politicians. They're the individual citizen legislator who says, \"That isn't what we're supposed to be here for.\" One of the things I found really interesting is the oath when you go into the Senate, it doesn't mention your state. It mentions the US Constitution, it mentions our country, do what's in the best interest of the country, and I found that that was in conflict with re-election with many members of the Senate, and that's the other reason I left is I didn't see a body that was capable of fixing the big problems of our country, because the government has become so ever big that it micromanages - on average, the average state government only gets to decide 40 percent of the issues of their own money, an unelected bureaucrat in Washington decides it the rest of the time. And that isn't what we bought in for, that isn't what I believe our Constitution or our framers thought. What our framers thought is that we had experiments going on in different states and that there was a limited role for the Federal government, and actually in the clear documents said everything else is left to the people and to the states. Well, we've abandoned that completely from Washington. We believe Washington - the country believes Washington, the politicians believe Washington. the judges believe Washington should control it all. And that isn't where I came from, that isn't what I was taught. I don't believe that's what our founders believed, and so we have a solution that will actually solve this great problem. LEVIN: Mark Meckler, you're an activist. One of the great leaders of the great tea party movement, 2010. Democrats are swept out of House of Representatives. Soon thereafter, Democrats are swept out of the Senate. You figure, \"Okay, now is the time to really get control over spending the size of government and so forth,\" and you see that's not happening. And you decide to move into another area. Tell us about convention of states. What is Article V of the Constitution all about and why is it so important that our viewers know about this? MECKLER: Well, you know, from all that activism, from the big switch in 2010 especially and realizing that nothing changed, I realized that we were attacking the wrong problem. The problem we were attacking was a personnel issue. Wong people in Congress. If we could just put the right people, then the right stuff would happen. Time has shown us that's not the case. We know that things haven't changed, we just had this $1.3 trillion supplemental budget, whatever you want to call it, it's just not fiscally responsible, so there had to be another problem, and if you dig in, what you find historically is we have created a structural problem. It's not a personnel issue, we've actually broken the structure of our government. So if you put good people like Tom Coburn in Congress, like Jim DeMint and others, now Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, there are some good people in Congress, they're working in a broken system. They cannot fix what ails the country. The founders gave us a remedy for this. They knew it was coming. In Article V of the Constitution, they inserted the second clause, which gives you and me, acting through our state legislatures the power to call a convention of states for the very purpose of proposing amendments to restrain government tyranny. And sometimes when I say that, people say, \"How do you know what the purpose was?\" And we can look back at Madison's notes. What happens is two days before the end of convention, September 15, 1787, you have Colonel George Mason from Virginia stands, addresses the assembly and says something like this. We have a problem with the document we've created. We've given the power to Congress to propose amendments, but not to people, and he asked a question, \"Are we so naive that we believe that a government that becomes a tyranny will ever propose the right kind of amendments to restrain their own tyranny?\" Madison's note - it's really interesting. They debated everything, right? Not that. His notes say \"nin com\" - in Latin means, no comment, no debate and unanimously, they vote to put the second clause of Article V that gives us the power. And important that we remember, specifically what they intended is the power to restrain a Federal government run amok. So that is the purpose of our efforts around Article V - it is to call a convention, get the states together and have them propose amendments specifically that will serve to restrain Federal tyranny. LEVIN: Isn't it true, Dr. Coburn, that this is what the states used to do? They used to meet, they used to have conventions, not constitutional conventions, conventions of the states, to resolve problems, to address issues, and so this was common practice, so to insert it in the Constitution as Mark Meckler says was to counter this notion that only amendments can come from the Federal Congress, two-thirds of both Houses and wasn't it Mason who said, \"What if Congress is oppressive? Then what will the people do?\" Other than violence, there needs to be a way to address this. So why do you think so many Republicans in State Houses and State Senates claim to be standing up for the Constitution by opposing the Constitution? That is, by opposing convention of states in Article V, which is the second way provided by the framers and the ratifiers to amend the Constitution. COBURN: Well, I think there are two reasons to that. You know, you either have fear or courage, and what we see today is a lot of fear in our country, and leadership requires courage to do the right thing, and so you also have a lot of interest groups that are making money off of opposing this, and actually siding with the far left progressive that we shouldn't fix our country and limit it. I think there's four main things that are allow a republic to survive. Touch stone, a little bit, but rule of law is really important, that's under stressed. Virtue, under stressed. There is no question about it. Number three is a limited government. We have anything, but a limited government, and number four is economic freedom. This country led the world for 200 years in economic freedom. We're 17th in the world now. Why is that? That's the tyranny of a large government that interferes with the ability to start, build and expand a business. And so one of the things you are seeing presently through the elimination of lots of regulation is good economic growth. It's not all based on taxes. It's based on the monkeys getting off business so it actually can create wealth and create jobs. So I think the number one reason is fear and lack of knowledge and so hopefully, through you and other people and what we're doing around the country is that we can educate people. Here's what our founders thought. This isn't a Johnny come lately idea. It's been there. They'd put it in intentionally so we could have a solution to where we are today, and they knew this would happen because history tells us this is what happens to republics. LEVIN: Mark Meckler, isn't it true, there's two ways to amend the Constitution under Article V, through Congress, state ratification, through the states, state ratification, that's really the only difference. But isn't it true today the Supreme Court amends the Constitution? Congress passes statutes, amends the Constitution, the massive bureaucracy. In other words, the process isn't being followed and so when you raise one of the processes that actually exists in the Constitution, that's actually a legitimate way to address efforts to act outside the constitutional boundaries. MECKLER: You nailed it, and the founders actually warned us about this, about amending the Constitution bit by bit, through the courts, through legislative action. This, Mark, by the way is why the left opposes this so much because they've been doing this for over a century. They amend through the courts, and most people don't realize this, they think of the Constitution as that thing they carry in their pocket or the one in the National Archives, a beautiful document. Today, if you order the Constitution from the government printing office, the government publishing office, you can order it, $130.00 roughly, it is now 2,738 pages; with the supplements, it's over 3,000 pages. It weighs over 10 pound, it contains every Supreme Court case that has ever told us what that beautiful succinct document means. It's outrageous. So we're living out of this big, fat document. It's not the Constitution that most people think we're living under. That is for the most part, the left's Constitution, they love the big fat book because it gives government almost unlimited power. LEVIN: So what do you say to those who say \"I love the Constitution,\" we'll never do better than the men who gathered in Philadelphia. My answer is, I agree, but we can do better than the men and women who serve on the Supreme Court or who serve in Congress because it is they who have changed the United States Constitution, and it is we who need to bring it back. Does that make sense? MECKLER: It does. This is actually a movement to restore the Constitution, and what I usually say to people who ask that question is, as I say, well, which Constitution are you referring to? I mean, we have two in America. We have the one that you and I and all your readers and listeners and viewers love and that's that pocket Constitution, the one in the National Archives and then, we have the one that's been changed over the last mostly 115 years by the Federal courts and the Supreme Court by actions of the Federal government. I love the original, and my goal is to strip away a bunch of those decisions that changed the Constitution, that gave the Federal government so much power, that made the citizens smaller and restore the citizen and the states to their proper place in the balance. LEVIN: Is it realistic to believe that the entities, the institutions and the individuals who have created this post-constitutional design will give us back our constitutional design? COBURN: Well, you know, I don't care what they believe. What I believe is, is the American spirit is about liberty and freedom, and if you go talk to individuals, I was in 32 states last year. If you go talk to individuals, they want their freedom. They want to be able to decide, and you know, as Mark says often, this movement is about making recommendations to the state. There's nothing foundational in this other than making a recommendation, but it's really about who gets to decide our own government, and what's happened is no longer do people get to decide. Unelected judges, unelected bureaucrats have decided for us. And so, it's about restoring the process. So I think we can, but I think what we have to do is be very clear about what our intent is. Our intent is about restoring liberty, about restoring decision-making at the states, about honoring the vision of our founders that we will decide as people. We give the power to the government. We give it to them. They don't give it to us, we give it to them, and we have the right to maintain and focus on our own freedom and our own movements within our individual states. And that's limited, of course, within the Bill of Rights, now, but the Bill of Rights is ignored, as are the enumerated powers. So I think it's ever positive that people can see that if we actually restore the commerce clause to what it was intended, then states will have a return of their rights to make decisions for their own individuals and the individuals in that states can actually control what happens in their state. LEVIN: When we come back, I want to ask you, is there anything to fear from this process? And what is this process exactly? Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget, almost every week night, you can watch Levin TV, Levin TV, by joining us, go to crtv.com/mark. crtv.com/mark or give us a call at 844-LEVIN TV. 844-LEVIN TV. We'd love to have you. Mark Meckler, Dr. Coburn, so what is this process? Is it set forth in the Constitution? What is the process? MECKLER: It is. It's found in the Second Clause of Article V, actually, the first and second clause, which lay out how we can amend our Constitution, the great founding document of our nation. Basically what it lays out is there's two ways. One is Congress can propose amendments, two-thirds of each house, and if they do so, then those go out to the states for ratification by three-quarters of the states which is 38 states today. The second method is the states get together and call for a convention for proposing amendments. That takes two-thirds of the states. LEVIN: So there's a meeting of the states. MECKLER: Yes. LEVIN: Representatives from the states. MECKLER: Yes. LEVIN: As opposed to a meeting of both Houses of Congress? MECKLER: Correct. LEVIN: Okay. MECKLER: So it's a parallel, and the states have full discretion of how to choose their own commissioners to the convention in true federalist fashion, I like that as a federalist. They could send as many people as they want to convention. Experts, they can send legislators. When they get there, each state has a single vote because it is actually a convention of states, not a convention of commissioners or delegates. They will get there, they will elect their officers, they will debate the subject matter set forth in their resolutions that sent them to convention, and then if 26 states, a majority of states can agree on any given amendment, those amendments then will be sent out to the states for ratification. The same as they would be if Congress does so. LEVIN: So the amendment ratification process, just to keep it - is exactly the same as it will be as if Congress proposed it. MECKLER: Identical. LEVIN: And you need 38 state legislatures or conventions of states to ratify? MECKLER: Correct. LEVIN: So, there can't be a runaway convention of states because they don't have the final say, correct? MECKLER: Correct. When people talk about a runaway convention and they express fear, one of the things that I say, \"I don't understand, you are actually afraid of people getting in a room and having a conversation and making recommendations?\" Because that's all a convention can do. It's what I describe as a suggesting convention. LEVIN: How many state resolutions must there be? They are almost identical. They cover the same subject matter. How many states need agree to do that before there can be a convention of states? MECKLER: The Constitution says two-thirds of states, and so that's 34 states required to pass what are called aggregable resolutions, that means they are substantially the same. They cover the same subject matter, and so far 12 states have passed these resolutions that we're working on. LEVIN: And these 12 states have passed these resolutions, so by my math, and I'm not good at it, you need 20 .. MECKLER: Twenty two more. LEVIN: Twenty two more? MECKLER: Correct. LEVIN: And I suspect if you got 10 more, you get the attention of Washington, DC. This process, Dr. Coburn, has been attacked. It's been attacked mostly by the left. There's hundreds of organization that are starting to organize against it, they are funded by multiple billionaires and some fringe elements on the right. The John Birch Society as well as others on the right, who apparently think the Constitution and the text of the Constitution should be embraced, except for Article V, which is the fire alarm for the republic, am I right about that? COBURN: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And fear guides it. The first thing to think about is the Congress right now can pass any amendment they want and send it to the states. Any crazy amendment. And why don't they? Because they know the American people wouldn't take it. So that's the first thing. The second thing is to remember that it requires 38 states to agree that anything that would come out of this. The converse of that is, all it requires is 13 judiciary chairmen to say, \"We're not taking this up.\" So 13 states control whether something is approved or not. So if they're worried about something being erroneous or out of whack with what the intent of our founders is, all you have to have is 13 people say, \"No, we're not going to even talk about it.\" So the safety this is tremendously engaged in terms of what our founders believed was important. A very high bar to get to a convention. You have to build consensus and then once you have a convention, then you have to have a super majority that says, \"Yes, we think we need to do.\" So people who are running around like chickens with their head cut off have one or two motives. One, they're trying to raise money because they don't agree with this because if they actually understand the process, they wouldn't be against it. Or number two, they're socialist Marxists which is the hard left which is saying, \"Don't do this because you're going to undermine all the socialism we've put into our country.\" Well, it's not about undermining socialism, it's not about not taking care of people, it's about restoring freedom, it's about restoring liberty, it's about restoring growth. I mean, think about what happened in terms of our country's growth after World War II. There was limited government and magnificent growth. 6 percent, 7 percent, 8 percent per year. What would that do if we saw that again in our country? So restoring that - so the position of most people who don't want to see this on the far right is it's a position that doesn't have foundation in the intellectual arguments, and they know it. John Birch, Larry McDonald entered into the congressional record, he was then head of the John Birch Society, the liberty amendments. Their founder embraced the liberty amendments. This is a modern day opposition and I suspect it's about raising money, not about being against what we're trying to do. LEVIN: Isn't the problem that the Constitution in so many respect has been eviscerated and it's interesting to hear the left, the progressive left whose intellectual forefathers, John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson, Ray - all these guys, attacked the Constitution, they despised the balance of power. They despised separation of powers. They despised Federalism. They were the same people today who have achieved the centralization of government where who you have five justices who determine what it is or not a fundamental right. Bedamn the republic. You have a massive bureaucracy that passes thousands of laws a year where Congress may pass hundreds and you have all of these decisions coming down from on high and here is this movement that says, \"Let us get our liberty back, let us get our Constitution back. Let us participate in our government,\" and then we have people saying, \"No, no. Don't touch the Constitution.\" Is that about right? MECKLER: It's accurate and it's interesting because that movement that prevent people from using Article V starts in about the 1970s after Roe versus Wade roughly. It comes from Chief Justice Warren Burger who was asked by a seminal figure on the right, Phyllis Schlafly, writes a letter to Burger and asked him what he thinks of the idea of a convention. Of course, she's talking about a convention at that time to overturn Roe versus Wade. That's his court's decision. So, naturally, he doesn't like this idea and he says, \"We might lose our beloved Constitution.\" They then begin this campaign that has now lasted 50 years roughly, saying it would be dangerous to hold a convention because they realized that for folks on the right, this is the only way to right the ship, this is the way to fix the structural deficit that's been created. LEVIN: And folks on the right, we're constitutionalists, we're not even really on the right. We're right here. You've got these guys over here, you've got these guys over here. We are constitutionalists and yet they stick us in these different corners and so forth. We'll be right back. ROBERT GRAY, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Robert Gray. The Indonesian island of Mambo hit by a third massive earthquake in less than a month. Today's magnitude 6.9 quake knocking out power across the resort island. The first earthquake hit on July 29th, killing at least 16 people. One week later, the second one killed more than 460. At least one person was killed today, but authorities are unable to survey the full extent of the damage due to the power outages. And rescue efforts are ramping up in the Indian coastal state of Kerala where the worst flooding in a century has left thousands trapped without food or water. Weeks of torrential monsoon rains triggering landslides that have wiped out entire villages. The rising waters have killed more than 350 people, displacing hundreds of thousands more. I'm Robert Gray. Now back to \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" LEVIN: Welcome back. Dr. Coburn, Mark Meckler. Dr. Coburn, what reforms are you proposing that we institute? COBURN: Well, actually, three areas, scope and jurisdiction of the Federal government, and I'll get specific on that. Financial responsibility, how about being accountable with our money? LEVIN: You've spent an entire career on this. COBURN: I have, and then finally limiting the terms of both appointed and elected officials. But let me go to the core one. The fact that your state can't control how it educates its children comes about through a court decision that expanded the definition of the commerce clause that to something totally different than what our founders believe and that applies to the State Department of Transportation, your own EPA, an environmental organization in your state. You just think all the different organizations in your state, they are controlled by a bureaucrat in the Federal government. So if you restrict back to the commerce clause to what our founders intended, all of a sudden the authority of the Federal government to reach in and tell your state agencies and your state legislators what they'll do because we know better in Washington versus when they really don't know better, then we have fixed and restored the Constitution to what it intends. What that does is a couple of things, number one, it gives flexibility to the states to do the right thing for them and their citizens at the right time versus a one size fits all everywhere. It also eliminates a ton of bureaucracy. So you can do that with the commerce clause, you can do that with the general welfare clause and you can do that with the necessary proper clause. All three of those have been prostituted by the courts to mean something totally different than what our founders meant. That will restore a ton of freedom. Forcing the government to live within its means, and making a hard choice - why isn't anybody working on this $12 trillion deficit we're having this year? LEVIN: They are. COBURN: They are working to raise it. Why aren't they worried about the $144 trillion of unfunded liabilities that the millennials are going to have, that we created by creating programs but never raising the tax base to pay for those. So having general accepted accounting principles, so they can't cheat. OMB cheats all the time. See, the congressional budget office cheats all the time with the numbers. I've been there. I've seen it. And then, the third thing is, shouldn't we limit the power of people who are appointed or are elected to actually be engaged for short time and come home and live under the laws that they make? And shouldn't we - and also, give an unlimited term to somebody because they at one time were approved by Congress as a judge? You know, look at all the judges that are in semi retirement that don't hardly carry any cases, and we're still paying them because they have a lifetime appointment. LEVIN: Now, you and I have written books about the history of this process and proposed reform amendments and so forth. Your book is, \"Smashing the DC Monopoly.\" My book is the \"Liberty Amendment.\" COBURN: Right. LEVIN: I started out opposing this idea. You may remember, we had a discussion about this. You probably didn't originally like the idea either. COBURN: I didn't consider it. I thought here's the way we should do it. LEVIN: Right and I started studying it. I said, \"This is exactly what the founders of this country would want, no?\" You didn't come to this easily either until you actually informed yourself about this. Is there any other way to restore our constitutional system? I don't know of any, do you? MECKLER: Not that I'm aware of, Mark, and I travel all over the country. Forty-four states in the last two years, I've spoken to thousands upon thousands of people. A small percentage of people object to this. And what I do, I always ask them that question. I say, \"Well, what's the alternative? You agree our system is broken, you agree the country is going to crash. What's your solution?\" I've never heard an alternative solution proposed. Literally, never. COBURN: We can cheat history, that's the key thing, our founders gave us a tool to cheat history. LEVIN: Meaning we don't have to decline. COBURN: We don't have to decline. And we have a tool in the Constitution if we use it and do it prudently and we will, then we can restore our country to the vibrancy that we once had. LEVIN: You know, I hear people talk about states' rights, the 10th Amendment, Federalism, but it's Article V that gives it teeth. So how can you support the 10th Amendment, state authority, talk about you're a federalist, you believe in federalism and reject the only method that exists in the Federal Constitution, for ensuring both of those things? And yet I find that in many respects this is the case. However, I also find that there are more and more people coming around. You have multimillions of people who support your organizations, 3.5 million in your grassroots operation. You've got even more and more Washington politicians and others who have supported this. We have Mike Huckabee. We have Marco Rubio. There are others, too, right? I can't remember them all. MECKLER: Yes, I mean, literally and they kind of span the spectrum across what I would call people who love the Constitution from maybe Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush is an endorser and you've got guys like Senator Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Senator Ben Sass, Senator Rand Paul. So these are guys that have been inside the machine. They come to politics from very different perspectives. Someone called them middle of the road guys, or very conservative guys, but the bottom line is, all of them realized there's no other way to fix the country right now. LEVIN: And if we don't take this route, this is what I like to ask, what are the options? We continue to do what we're doing? We continue to drive up the debt? Other reform amendments, some that I proposed, which is term limiting Supreme Court justices, members of the Senate, members of the House. Allowing a supermajority in House and the Senate, three-fifths to overturn a Supreme Court decision as long as they act within two years. To my view, there is no reason one justice should determine for the entire republic for all time that that's the position, or three-fifths of the state legislatures also acting within two years. Spending limits, taxing limits, borrowing limits. I only mention this so the audience understands it is we who want to reinstall, reinstitute constitutional limited government, because the Constitution is honored if at all in the breach, isn't that right? MECKLER: Right. COBURN: Right. LEVIN: And so the progressive agenda including on the courts, they wrap themselves in constitutional language and then say, \"We must follow the precedent.\" But the precedent isn't always constitutional, is it? COBURN: We have very many examples of where the Supreme Court has not followed precedent. MECKLER: Mark, as a lawyer, one of the most interesting things to - when I think back to my law school days and Justice Kennedy was actually a professor at my law school when I was there and one of the most interesting things is somebody asked me once, \"So, Mark, when you were in law school, did you read the Constitution?\" And I was actually a little offended by the question. LEVIN: And we're going to get your answer in one second. Mark, did you read the Constitution in law school? I know my answer. Don't forget, Levin TV almost every week night. Please join us, you're going to enjoy our community there as well. Got to crtv.com/mark, crtv.com/mark or give us a call, 844-LEVIN TV. We'll be right back. LEVIN: So Mark Meckler, we have this cliffhanger. You're in law school three years, did you ever study the Constitution? MECKLER: Never, not once, we never read it, which was astounding for me to look back, in hindsight it seems unbelievable. I took Con Law, every lawyer takes Constitutional Law their first year of law school. It's the foundation. LEVIN: And what do they teach you? MECKLER: They teach you what justices have said over the centuries about their interpretation of the Constitution, but you never get the original document, you never get the founders' intent. So what we're learning is this twisted view of the Constitution that has nothing to do with the original document. LEVIN: Were you ever taught did texturalism or regionalism - anything in this sort? MECKLER: Not even a little bit. And so, again, what we learned is something the founders would have despised which is essentially a worship of men - of men and women in black robes who make decisions who are supposedly so much smarter than the rest of us. LEVIN: Dr. Coburn, you brought up the commerce clause. The commerce clause was put in there because the states were fighting with each other. They wanted to promote commerce property, private property rights, trade - what we today call capitalism. What's happened to the commerce clause today? COBURN: Well, the commerce clause has been prostituted so that the Federal government takes the power and decides what is or is not their bailiwick through their definition of the commerce clause. In actual ruling was that a guy didn't do interstate commerce and because he didn't, it affected interstate commerce, and they gave this great expansion, it's just a farce. But the fact is, the commerce clause has been prostituted now far beyond anything our founders intended. LEVIN: That was the famous wheat case. They were on a new deal, where the government was insisting that this farmer grow wheat and sell it, and he was growing wheat to subsist on it, and they said no, you're affecting commerce by not being in commerce. COBURN: Right, which mean that that's interstate commerce. LEVIN: And so that's where the regulatory state took off. COBURN: Right, and that's why they control education in your state, that's why they control your state healthcare. Healthcare - you just name what the Federal government ... MECKLER: Energy, environment, all of those operate under this expanded definition of the commerce clause which gives literally unlimited power to the Federal government. COBURN: And unelected bureaucrats decide that, not your elected representatives. People who get appointed or work for the government decide your freedom. And that's what needs to be reversed. If we really want to fix our country and restore freedom and liberty, we need to make the decision-making start getting closer to the people instead of unelected bureaucrats. LEVIN: But isn't this the big battle between constitutionalism and progressivism? Because the progressives reject, at least as I said, their intellectual forefathers, the Constitution, they do not like the way it's set up, they want centralized decision-making like they had in Europe - Hegel, Marx - whatever you want to call it - socialism, communism, soft communism - the separation of powers stuff or individuals make decisions, individuals are not allowed to make decisions. Decisions have to be made for the general good, the community. Isn't that ultimately the battle that we're facing right now? COBURN: Absolutely, that's the direction we're going. And with that comes the loss of liberty, the loss of decision-making, the loss of freedom in the long term and tremendous debt. I mean how do you think we got to $22 trillion in debt? You can you take some of it for the war in the Middle East, but the rest of it is members of Congress expanding social programs without raising the revenue to pay for them. I mean, that's why where we are, and that's nothing but pure socialism. We just didn't tax to pay for it. MECKLER: And Mark, this is the battle of our generation literally, because the question is the progressive vision of the future or the founders and the constitutionalist's vision of the future, and the progressives are aligning against this. Hundreds of groups are speaking out against it. We see new pieces every day. They're attacking it in the culture, in \"The Atlantic\" and \"Esquire.\" LEVIN: Unions, environmental groups, left-wing think tanks, so-called consumer groups, a whole panoply of the left. MECKLER: Over 250 of them signed a press release together attacking this saying it's the most dangerous thing that could happen in America. What they said, they don't usually tell the truth. They actually said something truthful. They said this is intended to reverse 115 years of progressivism and we say yes, it is. LEVIN: Exactly. We'll be right back. Mark Meckler, we've got a large audience here. Patriots. People say, \"Okay, what can we do? What can we do?\" Isn't the question, \"What can each of you do?\" What can each person watching right now do? MECKLER: I think that's the fundamental question. Actually it's always been the fundamental question in America because it's always relied on the individual. We're unique, the citizen is sovereign. What that means is you, as an individual are sovereign in this country, you are expected to be engaged and active. And so most people don't realize that they actually have the power to do something about this. They don't need the permission of the President or Congress or even the courts. We don't need that. But what we do need is citizens, a citizen army of today, 3.5 million across the country supporting the effort. We need a lot more, Mark. I think that we need 30 million people engaged in the effort. They need to get signed up with the effort. LEVIN: What is the effort? MECKLER: It's go to conventionofstates.com, sign up, and there is literally a national movement. We have people in every state legislative district in the country, and what they're doing is they're lobbying their state legislators, they're talking to them, asking them to call for a convention of states. And it's going to take the people. The legislatures alone, they don't have the guts to do this. They don't have the will to do this. They're politicians. They're going to be driven by regular people, by their constituents, by this movement. And Mark, it's a movement of a lot of people who haven't been engaged in politics before because they didn't believe there was a reason. They saw they would vote and people go to DC and do whatever they want. Now, people understand if they are paying attention to this that it really is up to them. It's not up to the politicians. They talk to the politicians, they drive the politicians, they get them to call a convention. And frankly, once the convention takes place, their work isn't over. We're going to need the activists pressuring the convention to do the right thing, to pass the right amendments. When the amendments come out of convention, it's going to take the activists in a ratification fight as well. LEVIN: Is this a constitutional convention? COBURN: No, it's a convention of amendments only. If you have an application that says we want to reform the whole Constitution and you can get 34 states, you could do that. But this is only limited to the applicable areas we have requested. And we think if you did some in all three of the areas, you had markedly restored the principles of federalism, the balance of power between the three branches plus the new fourth branch that we've seen in the last 50 years and the judiciary, you'd restore the balance where you'd actually give power back to the states. LEVIN: Specific subject areas have to be agreed to by a supermajority of the states even before you have a meeting. COBURN: Right. LEVIN: As opposed to the United States Supreme Court that can pick and choose its own issues, through its own cases, vote 5 to 4, and that's that. And so here, this is the broad body politic, the American people, not a mobocracy, working through the representatives in the states to achieve something that is noble and legitimate under our constitutional system. We'll be right back. Dr. Tom Coburn, what are the chances that this convention of states will occur in the next five or ten years? COBURN: I think very good, and the reason is because I think the government is going to continue to expand and grow and interfere in your lives and the American people are going to understand that the debt load that is coming and the interest costs associated with that is going to limit the very critical problem. In less than five years, the Federal budget will be made up of interest and Medicare and Medicaid. That's it. LEVIN: Defense? COBURN: Nope. No money. So we will see the pressure come to the American people because of the incompetency of the government that we have today outside of the rules that our founders intended and they will come on board to solve this problem. LEVIN: Do you agree? MECKLER: I agree and I agree from a grassroots perspective having been all across the country over the last couple of years, what I see is a rising tide of people who are very concerned about the fundamentals in this country and mostly what they want to do, Mark, is just decide for themselves. And this is a fight about who decides - Washington, DC versus the people. The founders answered that question very clearly at the beginning of the Constitution in big bold calligraphy, \"We, the people decide,\" and I think that movement is rising in America. LEVIN: The American people will decide their own fate. That's the bottom line, and you two gentleman are among the leaders of a movement that is showing them the way to do it. Is there a solution? Yes. Embrace the Constitution COBURN: Yes. LEVIN: That's where the answer is. I want to thank you, both. MECKLER: Thank you, Mark. COBURN: Thank you. LEVIN: Really appreciate it. MECKLER: You bet.

This is a rush transcript from \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" August 26, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good Sunday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo. Remembering the life and legacy of Senator John McCain, who passed away yesterday at the age of 81. Tributes have been pouring in this morning for Senator McCain. The war hero and former Republican presidential nominee died in Arizona one day after his family said that he had ended treatment for an aggressive form of brain cancer. The man known as the maverick left this world just as he lived in it, on his terms. We have a report from Washington straight ahead on new information this morning about how the nation will honor Senator McCain, as well as where his final resting place will be. We will also get reaction from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy coming up, along with Congressman Darrell Issa, and our panel, including former Reagan-Bush campaign manager Ed Rollins. We're also talking about the number four person at the Justice Department. Bruce Ohr will go before House lawmakers next week, on the 28th, to answer questions about the Steele dossier and whether President Trump hinted he may be closer to declassifying documents related to that FISA warrant. All that and more right now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" A deep sense of loss in Washington today, as flags are lowered to half- staff in honor of John McCain's decades of service to our country. The longtime Arizona senator passed away yesterday at the age of 81, ending his year-long battle with brain cancer. John McCain expected to lie in state at the Arizona Capitol and Capitol Rotunda in Washington. He will receive a full-dressed funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral before his burial at the Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland. President Trump tweeted his condolences last night, saying this -- quote -- \"My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you.\" Chad Pergram is live from the Russell Senate Office Building right now on Capitol Hill, which could soon undergo a name change in McCain's honor -- Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Right. You're right. And so John McCain's casket will be brought here to Capitol Hill for him to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. He will be the 30th person to lie in state. The first was Henry Clay, the former Kentucky senator and speaker of the House in 1852. There will be an honor guard stationed around the Capitol Rotunda around the clock to guard his casket. And the public will be allowed to file in. He will be buried in Annapolis after those services. But we're going to see some things in the next couple days. The Senate will come back to session on Monday afternoon at 4:00. And if custom holds, what they will do, is they will drape a block cloth across his desk in the United States Senate and put some flowers there. We expect tributes to John McCain from senators as they come to the floor to talk. And the Senate usually, when there's a death of one of their colleagues or someone significant, what they do is they adjourn for the day in honor of that person. Now, we expect that to happen on Monday. Now, there's been a movement afoot here by Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, to rename the very building in which I'm speaking, the Russell Senate Office Building. It's named after Richard Russell, who was a Democratic senator from Georgia. Richard Russell was very controversial. He served 38 years in the Senate, but his views on civil rights were not exactly occurrent with what we would think in contemporary society today. And so this could be a fight to try to change the name of this building. It's something that doesn't go to the president. If the Senate votes to do so, they would just change the name of this building. There are two other buildings here on Capitol Hill also named after congressional legends, Everett Dirksen, the former Republican Senate leader from Illinois, and Phil Hart, a Democrat from Michigan. So changing the name of a building is a big, big deal. A couple of stories here. One thing I remember about John McCain, a lot of people talk about how he was kind of irascible, but one thing I always noticed is that he was often in a hurry. And there's a subway that runs underground between the Capitol and the Russell Senate Office Building. And he would always be scurrying back and forth to try to get back to a committee meeting or make it to the floor for a vote. And there's a button where you would call for the subway and you would hear a bell ring. And he would practically be punching that button, because he didn't have time to waste. And sometimes I wondered when I would see him do that if that was because he basically lost all those years being held captive in Vietnam -- Maria. BARTIROMO: Wow. Incredible story there. Chad, thank you very much. PERGRAM: My pleasure. BARTIROMO: Members of Congress are remembering Senator McCain as a war hero, American patriot and political titan. Congressman Kevin McCarthy is the House majority leader. He joins me right now. Good to see you, Congressman. Thanks so much for being here. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-CALI., HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Thank you so much for having me back. BARTIROMO: Any special stories you can share with us of your time with John McCain this morning? MCCARTHY: Well, I just believe great nations require great sacrifice from their leader. There's been few leaders that have ever sacrificed as much as John McCain. He was fierce, he was loyal. He would work across the other side of the aisle, but he could be the very best person in a battle. I think the very best story is not one that he told, but one that he showed. If you just watched him put his jacket on, he never complained about what he went through, but the pain of putting on a jacket... BARTIROMO: Wow. MCCARTHY: Of raising the hand, it was more than his speech. It showed sacrifice. He could make fun of himself. But there's many times when we were in the legislative battle, and we knew we're not going to win this, and we knew we're going against the odds of the establishment and others. He's the one that I would want to be in the fight with, because he didn't care and he would never give up. And it wasn't that that day we didn't win. We're going to win the argument and eventually we're going to win the fight. BARTIROMO: Well, he didn't care. You're right. And that was something that made him stand apart. But it was -- also created some problems. When he gave the thumbs-down on health care, that was a big issue, and obviously stopped anything from moving forward. But that also showed the principles that he had. He stuck to what he believed in. MCCARTHY: There's times we disagreed. BARTIROMO: Right. MCCARTHY: But I respected his ability and what he did. Even though he was home getting treatment, I would talk to Congressman Mac Thornberry, the chairman of Armed Services, when they walk in through the NDAA. He's getting his treatment, but Senator McCain would be right there doing the work. He knew exactly what was going on. There's no one that understood the military better or the idea of what happens around the world. When we would travel to other countries and sit with those leaders, it was always a person they'd ask about, and it was John McCain, because they knew him personally and they trusted him. And that helped America's foreign policy around the world during all different eras and different times. BARTIROMO: He was a true patriot. Our love and condolences out to his family, obviously. And we will be waiting to see in the next couple days how he is laid to rest, as we reported earlier. What does this mean for the upcoming midterms? Let me switch gears here, Congressman, and ask you what you're expecting in November. It feels like you're going to have more success on the Senate side than the House. At least, that's -- the speculation is right now. MCCARTHY: Well, the Senate has a much different map. And the map that they are playing is a much better map. House has a history against them, where the party in power normally loses seats -- I mean the party that has the White House. But there's two times that's been different. When you look at what this election is going to be about, it's going to be about results vs. resistance, Pelosi's resistance. And look at what results we have economically. The last time there was a party in power that had economic growth at 4 percent, they actually gained seats. But take this one statistic. In the last 49 years of America, unemployment has only been below 4 percent eight months, eight months in 49 years. BARTIROMO: Wow. MCCARTHY: But three of those eight months were this year. BARTIROMO: That's incredible. MCCARTHY: It's unbelievable the results that have been achieved. Unemployment claims, 44-year low. But what I'm more proud about, it cuts across all parts of America, if you're African-American, Hispanic, woman, some of the best unemployment you have ever seen. If you didn't have -- if you just had a high school degree, one of the best opportunities. So we have got a unique opportunity going forward. And think what we did. We rebuilt our military. Think about what we did with the VA. It used to be, a G.I. Bill only 15 years, you had to use it or you lost it. No, we have made it a lifetime. Or think of what we have done to combat human trafficking, modern-day slavery, where people are actually traded -- 70 percent of it happens because of the Internet. We shut that down. BARTIROMO: Wow. MCCARTHY: Or we have done the most to end opioid epidemic of any Congress before us. We have got more work to do, but if you measure our results vs. Pelosi's resistance, not one Democrat voted for that economic package. BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: So everybody who got a bonus, those 49 states that have lower electrical bills, not one Democrat voted for that. They thought it was Armageddon. BARTIROMO: Yes, I wonder if the people hold them to account for that, because you're right. Nobody voted for this. And we're actually seeing needle move on economic growth. The Atlanta Federal Reserve yesterday comes out and says, we're increasing our expectation for the economy for the third quarter to 4.6 percent. That's going to be two straight quarters of better than 4 percent growth. That's incredible. MCCARTHY: If that doesn't do enough for people, think about what their agenda is. First, they are very clear, because they put it across the desk, they want to abolish ICE. So those MS-13 members that come across, those kids that have been trafficked that get stopped that ICE saves, or what about all that fentanyl that ICE saves in the process? They want to -- 167 voted present in the process. The other thing they want to do, they want to impeach this president. They voted on it twice already. They forced the vote to the floor. Tom Steyer has spent more than $30 million. He brags that his list is bigger than the NRA list on impeaching this president. BARTIROMO: Wow. MCCARTHY: And then the last thing they want to do, single-payer health care. So 55 percent of Americans have health care through their employer. That would end. But the scariest thing of this, those who are on Medicare, you will end, because they will bankrupt it before it's signed, because they're going to put everybody into it. It will bankrupt Medicare. It costs $32 trillion. BARTIROMO: This is a really important point here you're making, that the 60 percent of people have health care through their company. And that will end. MCCARTHY: That will end. But it's not -- more than 100 Democrats currently in Congress have co- sponsored it. Now, let's look at who their candidates are. They got Gil Cisneros running in Royce's district. He's being accused of sexual harassment by a Democrat legislator. They have got problems with these candidates that they have before us time and time again. Look at the individuals that wants to run in Paul Ryan's seat. Numerous times, he's been arrested in the process. I don't think they have vetted the people they have gone through. So this election is going to be much different. It's kind of like the weather. It changes kind of week by week. Two weeks ago, the generic ballot was at the exact same place it was the day before the election in 2016. BARTIROMO: Wow. So, it's changing that quickly? MCCARTHY: Yes. Remember what happened in 2016? We kept the majority and President Trump won. So the battle is going to go forward, but the intensity level is on our side. If Republicans get out and vote, we will keep the majority. BARTIROMO: Yes, but you would think, with all of this good news, from the economy to foreign policy and beyond, that you would have more unity within your party. You're running for speaker. You have got others within the Republicans running for speaker. How are you going to get together, show a unified front, so that people understand that you are all together and behind this president? MCCARTHY: Well, the most important thing you have got to do is make sure there's 218 Republicans, so there could be a Republican speaker. I think what this president has shown, the results he has gone, the safety that he's created, the world is a safer place. Iran will not have a nuclear weapon today. North Korea is sitting down. And when they didn't follow through, you know what the president did, just like when he stopped the first meeting, bringing them back to the table to do what's right? BARTIROMO: Yes. MCCARTHY: And then he's standing up to open up more markets for us. I think that's very important economically, where we are. If you look back at history, a party that has this much results with an opposition of just resistance, with an idea that they are going to abolish ICE, impeach the president, who wants that much chaos going into the future? BARTIROMO: Right. MCCARTHY: Nothing will get done. And they just want to reverse. Nancy Pelosi says she wants to reverse the tax cuts, so you will pay more in the future. BARTIROMO: She did say that. She -- I was shocked that she would actually admit that. Look, I think the markets are giving this president and the Congress some -- the benefit of the doubt. MCCARTHY: New records every day. BARTIROMO: The benefit of the doubt in terms of the trade issues and the tariffs issues, but no doubt that that is an uncertainty out there. Do you expect we will see a deal with Mexico over the near term? MCCARTHY: I do. And I think it would be very soon. We would vote on it on next Congress, but NAFTA needed a modernization. We needed to open the market up. Remember when this was written, in the '90s, and think of what the financial markets have done. Agriculturally, we have to have better markets going through, lowering the tariffs, letting America's products there. That only builds to the future. Remember, the E.U. has come forward that they want to lower tariffs. South Korea, we renegotiated our trade agreement there. That all leads into where China is talking about in September sitting down with us. I was just with Secretary Mnuchin this weekend. He's talked about the prospects of going forward. Each agreement we make only makes it stronger for the next. And there's not one place in the world will not agree with us of what China has been doing for the number of years, of stealing intellectual property. BARTIROMO: Right. MCCARTHY: Of -- of really gaming the system. BARTIROMO: Forcing that transfer of technology. MCCARTHY: Yes. BARTIROMO: Right? And then enabling Chinese companies to come back and compete with American companies. And we taught them all about it. MCCARTHY: Its been an unfair trade process for many years. BARTIROMO: It feels like the U.S. and Canada have really gone at each other. Do you feel that you are going to see Canada follow suit? Let's say, hypothetically, you do get a deal with Mexico in the next week, next week perhaps. Will Canada follow suit and come up with a better NAFTA? MCCARTHY: I believe so. I believe we're very close. And also, remember, we make policy in the world of politics. Remember what politics were going on. Mexico was having a presidential election. So it's very hard for them to make an agreement at the time. That election is over, but the new president is not sworn in. First thing this administration did was go down there. And as they get that, as they get this agreement done, we know where Canada is. But when it only makes us stronger, and you're going into a new election next year in Canada, it's beneficial to them to have this all agreed upon this year. BARTIROMO: All right. MCCARTHY: I think that's positive. And then that only builds to our negotiations with China. BARTIROMO: Right. MCCARTHY: The more we lower tariffs. And remember this one thing. It's not America who are raising the prices. It's China who raises the tariffs on American products to enter the market. All we're asking for is, let's have a level playing field. Let's have a fair agreement. And what will happen, we continue to build on these results, the next century will be America. BARTIROMO: All right, we will talk about this. Let's take a short break. I want to ask you about some of your comments recently about social media and what's going on in terms of potentially censoring conservatives. We have got more with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on the other side of this break. Stay with us. And then we will hear from Congressman Darrell Issa. On our panel, Ed Rollins, Mary Kissel, and Gregg Jarrett. And we continue to remember the life and legacy of John McCain. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We're back now with Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader. And, Congressman, you have been tweeting talking a lot recently about this potential bias that -- this censoring of conservatives by social media. You confirmed the other day that Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, will testify in front of the Energy and Commerce Committee on September 5. MCCARTHY: Fifth, yes. BARTIROMO: Tell me what you're expecting. MCCARTHY: Well, first of all, you have got to look at the problem. Social media has become the modern-day town square -- 67 percent, two- thirds of all adults get some of their news from the social media. And it only continues to climb. But you look at the stories, what we found, two weeks before the California Republican primary, if you Googled the California Republican Party, they said our ideology wasn't the party of Lincoln or Reagan. It was Nazism. BARTIROMO: How does that happen? They say it was an algorithm. How does that happen? MCCARTHY: They said, well, these algorithms. Then just look what's happened on Facebook and Twitter. Elizabeth Heng, who is running against Jim Costa in California, her parents escaped Cambodia. She has an amazing story to tell. They won't show the video for the same footage that would be on PBS. Or Prager University, these non -- it's a nonprofit that talks about conservative subjects. But they had Alan Dershowitz talking about Israel for five minutes. They had George Will talking about baseball. YouTube's rated them equal to the same categories as pornography, so Facebook wouldn't show it. BARTIROMO: That's incredible. MCCARTHY: And then we found what VICE came forward with, that conservative voices were being shadowboxed -- or shadow-banned on Twitter. BARTIROMO: Right. MCCARTHY: And we looked at all of the progressive Democrats, none of them.  And they say it was an algorithm. Now, I want to give Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, some credit, because I have been talking to him. And I requested him to come in. We have had numerous conversations throughout this month. He's coming in. Now, we disagree philosophically. He will say he's a liberal. I'm a conservative. But he does believe in the First Amendment. Now, the algorithm that he writes, I have real concerns about. Like, the other day, just my setting has sensitive. Laura Ingraham put something out about the election in Sweden and conservatives having -- going to win because of immigration. That was marked as sensitive, and not showed to me. BARTIROMO: Immigration is sensitive. Come on. MCCARTHY: So, that algorithm -- but he's... BARTIROMO: Somebody sets up the algorithm, though. MCCARTHY: Exactly. Who are those people? Remember what happened to President Trump's own Twitter account, was taken down by a person in Europe. BARTIROMO: You don't want to see more regulation. You just want them to clean up their act. MCCARTHY: I want transparency, transparency, especially before the election. Well, Jack is coming in. He wants to be very open. The other social platforms should be open as well to what's going on, because what happens here is, if there's a conservative being shut down, that voice is not being heard. And if this is where two-thirds of Americans are getting their news, it's not a fair process. And this country believes in fairness. The Internet was created on fairness. BARTIROMO: This is really important. We will be watching that testimony.  Thank you so much for coming. MCCARTHY: Thank you. BARTIROMO: Great to see you, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. MCCARTHY: Thank you. BARTIROMO: Stay with us. More on the life and legacy of John McCain. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. This morning, we are remembering the life of Arizona Senator John McCain, who lost his brave battle with brain cancer yesterday, at the age of 81. Looking at the flag at the Capitol at half-staff this morning in honor of the senator. Let's bring in California Congressman Darrell Issa. He's been on Capitol Hill roughly as long as Senator McCain was. And, Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. REP. DARRELL ISSA, R-CALIFORNIA: Well, my length of service pales in comparison to the late senator. But I did have the honor of serving with him. And everyone has a story. Half of my stories are sitting in the barber's chair with Mario as he got what little hair he had cut once a week every week, but also being in Pakistan at the base that Gary Powers took off in that famous U-2 incident as we were looking at the Pakistan-Afghan border. And this man 20 years my senior looking -- looking less exhausted than I was, because he was used to taking that kind of treatment that it takes to-- to just keep going. BARTIROMO: He was just an incredible man. He really was, and such principles. But what he did for our country in terms of serving in the military and the patriot that he always was and his father was and his grandfather was, really a long history of patriotism and love for our great country. ISSA: Well, you're exactly right. And, you know, patriotism sometimes runs in a family and sometimes the second or third generation takes it for granted, but that certainly wasn't the case with John. And I think, when he's remembered this coming week and the week after and the months after, it's going to be as a patriot. With all his strengths and weaknesses, all his accomplishments, it was really just the fact that America came first with him at all times. BARTIROMO: Absolutely. Congressman, let me switch gears and move forward and ask you about this ongoing saga of Bruce and Nellie Ohr. And, of course, Bruce Ohr was the number four official at the Department of Justice. He will be in front of your committee in the next week, the Judiciary Committee, as he testifies. What are you looking to get from Bruce Ohr this upcoming week, sir? ISSA: Well, you know, what the question always is, the infamous question, what did you know and when did you know it? It's clear that we know some things. He knew that Christopher Steele had been dismissed. He knew that the information in that fake dossier shouldn't go forward. He knew that, in fact, that he had it go forward. He, of course, also knew that his wife was actively involved in it. And, as an attorney, there are things you disclose or recuse yourself. He did neither. So the questions will be about the things he clearly knew and did wrong. Remember that this isn't us saying there's a problem with Ohr. He's been demoted from being the highest-ranking nonpolitical appointee, highest- ranking nonpolitical, if you will. He's been demoted twice. And he's been demoted for cause. And one of the causes is the clear distortion of the FISA warrant that led to this entire investigation that now turns out to be false in so many ways. BARTIROMO: That's right. And, you know, last week, we had on your colleague Congressman John Ratcliffe, who also sits on the House Judiciary Committee along with you. And he believed the questioning of Bruce Ohr this upcoming week, he said last week on this program he said he may actually after this testimony need to call back former DOJ officials to testify before Congress. Listen to what he told us last week, sir. I want to get your reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, R-TEXAS: I think that, after we work through current Department of Justice employees like Bruce Ohr, we will get to those folks like Sally Yates and Jim Comey and Loretta Lynch that are no longer at the Department of Justice or the FBI, and we will be requesting that they appear either voluntarily or involuntarily, by subpoena, if necessary, because there's been a lot of documents and testimony that has come out since the last time they testified under oath before Congress that calls into question some of that prior testimony. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: So, connect the dots for us, Congressman. Sally Yates was the person that Bruce Ohr reported to. Why would you need Lynch and Comey to come back and Sally Yates to come testify as well? ISSA: Well, partly because of the inconsistencies. Peter Strzok told us a great deal about Bruce Ohr's activities and what he did and how it was done. And, obviously, you also have McCabe, who was fired for cause. So, as we get through these -- these, if you will, statements that contradict each other, we have a reason to have people back to see if they want to correct the record, in other words, tell us the truth, and the whole truth this time. BARTIROMO: But where is the accountability for lying in the first place then? I mean, you know, we keep seeing issues where people are getting immunity, and then we know that they lied under oath, and now this. You have got to have these -- this group back because the testimonies don't add up. Are the American people going to see accountability here and justice? ISSA: You know, Maria, that's one of the biggest challenges. The Constitution only gives one entity the ability to hold people accountable legally. And it happens to be the entity in which all this wrongdoing was going on. When you have the fourth highest person, the third highest person, and even Loretta Lynch, the highest person, all doing things that are just wrong, and they are the only entity that, in fact, can hold people accountable legally under our Constitution, so it begs the question of, when will the attorney general engage in an area in which he is not recused, order these documents to be delivered in a timely fashion, and begin ordering real investigations leading to criminal prosecutions for false statements and wrongdoing? This is one of the areas in which my former colleague Senator Jeff Sessions needs to step up to the plate and engage, because it's his responsibility. And, quite frankly, he's the only one that can do it. His number two clearly won't. BARTIROMO: But, Congressman, his number two is also a witness. Rod Rosenstein signed off on the FISA warrant, for the -- for the last FISA warrant. I want to ask you about that, and I also want to ask you about the president potentially declassifying all of those documents, so that the American people can actually see a transparent situation, what took place in 2016. Let's slip in a quick break, Congressman, a lot of questions for you on the other side of this break. ISSA: Of course. BARTIROMO: And, of course, will President Trump declassify those FISA documents? As we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" stay with us -- more with Darrell Issa on the other side. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: And we are back with Congressman Darrell Issa, Republican of California. And, Congressman, we were just talking about Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, moments ago. And you said Jeff Sessions is the only one who can do this, to right this wrong ship. But he's not doing it. Should the president fire Jeff Sessions, Congressman? ISSA: Well, I think the president has an obligation to make it clear -- and I think he's done that -- that Jeff Sessions has to step up to the plate and do his job. He's ordered open and transparent communication. In other words, give Congress the documents they're asking for in the most unredacted way possible. And what he's done is allowed the bureaucrats to slow-walk us and give us documents that look like a black cow eating a licorice at midnight. They're just all black. BARTIROMO: That's right. ISSA: And that's unacceptable. And so when the president, rightfully so, says that if Jeff Sessions won't do it, then the president will in fact use his authority to clear the classified requests and the attorney-client privilege and the presidential prerogatives out of the way and make it available. And this is something that needs to be done. Of course, you need to make sure that if somebody's life is at risk, that you protect them. But after that, the rest of it really is the president saying he wants to be open and transparent, and every one of his Cabinet officers needs to heed that and provide that kind of information quickly. BARTIROMO: Yes, but why wouldn't he just declassify these documents, Congressman? You know, when I asked him that when I interviewed the president in July of this year, he said, well, some people are saying, don't do it, they don't want me to get involved. And then, of course, we know that the special counsel is trying to look for any obstruction. But why would that be obstruction? Wouldn't that just be shining a light on things, making it more transparent? What's the downside risk? ISSA: Well, one of the interesting things is, of course, the special prosecutor gets everything completely unredacted. We're only asking to, quite frankly, look over his shoulder and look over the shoulder of other investigations that should occur. Understand, the president inherited a system that likes to give no one anything. I often say that the most highly classified thing there is anywhere in Washington is embarrassment. And so, often, it's what they don't want you to know because they don't want you to -- they don't want to be embarrassed. It's not real classification. BARTIROMO: Right. ISSA: But the president is doing the right thing, exactly the opposite of President Obama. He's saying, make it open and transparent. When Jeff Sessions was a senator, he certainly would have said, I want the information. He in fact, maybe not as quickly as John McCain, made the moral argument that we needed to know about Benghazi and prevent that from happening again. BARTIROMO: Right. ISSA: And he demanded documents. Now he needs to be on the other side, saying Congress has an absolute right, the American people have a right, and he needs to lead that or get out of the way. BARTIROMO: So... ISSA: And when I say get out of the way, he -- somebody has to replace him that will do it if he won't. BARTIROMO: Well, you said that the special counsel gets to see everything unredacted. A lot of people have been making the point recently, me included, that the special counsel's investigation will not have credibility unless he looks at everything, both sides. We know that Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid upwards of a million dollars for that dossier. They spent the money on the dossier. Then they used the dossier to get a warrant to wiretap. They didn't -- they didn't tell the FISA court that the DNC and Hillary Clinton paid that million dollars for it. And yet we haven't heard a word about this from the special counsel. Can Robert Mueller continue this investigation without looking at the FISA process and what took place in 2016? ISSA: Well, I think a way to put it -- and I agree with you -- is, Rod Rosenstein needs to give specific instructions that says, you can and should do that. And if he isn't willing to do it, we have to look to his own culpability in that false FISA warrant that he had a part in. BARTIROMO: Right. He's a witness. Let me switch gears real quick, Congressman, and ask you about China and trade, because really stunning developments on Friday, when the president decided to stop Mike Pompeo from going to North Korea for this planned trip, and then talked about how China is not where he thought they should be in terms of trade. Where are we in this battle with China right now? ISSA: Well, you know, the -- the way you get a deal, whether it's a national security deal with North Korea on their nuclear weapons, or a trade deal that begins to get some level of fairness from China, is you have got to be willing to walk away from it. The president is the master of the art of the deal. He wants to be there. He clearly will turn Mike around, Mike Pompeo around, the secretary, in hours if there's an opportunity. But he's not going to send them there just to have a pretty portrait of people shaking hands. And I think that's the difference in this negotiator, is, the deal is off if you're not making progress. The deal is back on quickly if you are. He's done it before. He can do it again. But, Maria, the thing that I think the American people have to understand is, although trade is a national security issue, you can not continue to give away hundreds of billions of dollars of the American people's hard- earned money to China just because China has a bad actor that periodically will misbehave. And they use it as leverage. And that's exactly what China continues to do. BARTIROMO: Mm-hmm. It's true. And they won't even admit that they are taking the I.P. and that they're stealing so much technology from the U.S. and forcing the transfer of tech. So we will see if this strategy works in terms of changing China's behavior. We love having you on, sir. Please come back soon. Great to see you, Congressman. ISSA: Thanks, Maria. BARTIROMO: Congressman Darrell Issa there. Remembering a senator, war hero and former Republican presidential nominee, John McCain, our panel is here with that and other big stories of the week.  Panel up next. Stay with us, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: We are remembering the life and legacy of John McCain this morning, a war hero, senator and presidential nominee, after he lost his brave battle with brain cancer yesterday at the age of 81. Our panel joins us right now to talk more about that. Ed Rollins is former White House adviser to President Reagan. He's a FOX News contributor. Mary Kissel is back, editorial board member for The Wall Street Journal and also a FOX News contributor. And Gregg Jarrett joins us this morning, FOX News legal analyst and author of the top-selling book \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\" Gregg, good to have you. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Great to see everybody. ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. BARTIROMO: And, Ed, you go back with Senator John McCain, don't you? ROLLINS: I first met John McCain when he came back from Vietnam from prison in 1973. He handled the Senate congressional relations for a while. I was doing congressional relations. I was a secretary for transportation. So we hung out together and we all were involved in the Watergate and what have you. He was always a man of great fun, great integrity, great intellect. He wasn't always a happy warrior. Sometimes, he was a grumpy warrior. But he was always a warrior. And I think the only battle he ever lost was this one, and he lost it with great class and great -- there will never be another one like him. And I say that in a very positive way. I fought with him on many occasions. I loved him on many occasions. But he was an extraordinary human being. And the Congress was very lucky to have him and the country was very lucky to have him. BARTIROMO: He was a maverick. And when he named Sarah Palin as his running mate, initially, I thought it was brilliant. (LAUGHTER) ROLLINS: Well, in a way, it was brilliant. For about three weeks, she drove the agenda. And, again, he was the most beloved candidate ever to run for president by the media, unfortunately not so much by the conservatives. But at the end of the day, the country was well-served by him. And the veterans of this country owe him an undying debt for all the things... BARTIROMO: And the world as well. Today, we're talking about world issues, Mary Kissel. I want to get your take on the president's decision on Friday to stop Mike Pompeo from going to North Korea because of the challenges that the U.S. is having with China, largely, and I guess North Korea as well. MARY KISSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I thought it was a very encouraging sign, Maria, because let's be honest, there hasn't been a lot of progress since President Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June. And I think it was right for the president to acknowledge that and not sort of reward the North Koreans with another meeting with a Cabinet-level official. Now, President Trump, remember, called off the Singapore summit before he called it back on again. BARTIROMO: That's true. KISSEL: So I hope that he sticks with this decision, but it's a step in the right direction. BARTIROMO: What do you want to see happen in terms of the U.S. and North Korea, just complete denuclearization? I mean, what would be victory? KISSEL: Well, victory, according to the White House -- and we agree with this on the editorial page -- is complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization. And the Trump administration has acknowledged that dragging out talks in the past has not worked, that bribing North Korea doesn't work. But they have a big problem in the South Korean administration, Maria, because you have a give there in Seoul that is very far to the left and that wants rapprochement with the North at any cost. So if there's a problem here, it's not just China that we have a problem with. It's our ally and friend in Seoul. BARTIROMO: So many incredible issues going into the midterm elections, not to mention the issues around the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the president now attacking Jeff Sessions in a louder voice. Gregg Jarrett, you wrote the book \"The Russia Hoax.\" Your thoughts on the president's tweets this week basically pointing out that Jeff Sessions, according to the president, is not doing his job? GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, the president is absolutely correct. First, at the outset, Jeff Sessions betrayed the president. Sessions told the Senate Intelligence Committee he began his recusal his first day in office. He concealed his intentions from the president. So the president was betrayed from the outset. And then Jeff Sessions has taken very little action to go after, as I name them in the book, the law enforcers who became the law breakers. He should have renewed and reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails, gone after her for the destruction of evidence under a lawful subpoena. And why hasn't he investigated Hillary Clinton and her campaign paying a foreigner, a British spy, for information from Russians which was then used as the basis for the Trump-Russia investigation and wiretap warrants? All of that should have been done. BARTIROMO: Right. And next week, Bruce Ohr, the number four guy at the Justice Department, will testify and answer questions behind closed doors. What are you expecting from the Bruce Ohr testimony, Gregg? JARRETT: Well, I have 63 pages of Ohr's notes, e-mails, and text messages between himself and Christopher Steele. There are going to be a lot of questions about the nefarious activities between those two men in pushing the Trump-Russia collusion hoax. BARTIROMO: Well, you know, this is probably the most consequential midterm elections that we have seen in a long time, Ed Rollins. Do these issues come up? Do these issues drive voters, or is it largely economic, or something else in November? ROLLINS: Well, every race will be different. The interesting thing in this race is, there are 66 races in the House that are listed as tossups or lean one way or the other. Only four of those are Democrats. Most of them are ours. We have 39 Republicans either retiring or running for another office, the biggest vacancy since 1930. So my sense is, you have got to go out and you got take these new candidates, the Democrats, apart. And so the issues that we want to run on, the economic issues, what have you, are a little tougher. And there's 10 weeks left to go. A ton of money out there. Bloomberg, the former mayor, has put $80 million into Democratic races, clearly has defined himself. BARTIROMO: Yes. ROLLINS: We have raised a tremendous amount of money on our side. So every race will be well-funded. But it's just a question of time. What can you do? BARTIROMO: The outcomes have been positive, whether it's economic outcome or foreign policy outcome. I want to get your take on the outcomes when we come right back, Mary Kissel. Let's take a short break. The panel stays right here. More in a moment when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: We're back with our panel, Gregg Jarrett, Mary Kissel, and Ed Rollins. And before we went to the break, we were talking about the midterms and the outcomes, Mary. The Federal Reserve of Atlanta just raised its expectation for economic growth for the third quarter to 4.6 percent. KISSEL: Yes. BARTIROMO: You have got good outcomes, and yet the midterms seem tight as ever. KISSEL: Yes, that's true, Maria. The president has a great story to tell, if he talks about the economy, if he talks about regulatory reform, if he talks about energy market liberalization. But I think the danger here is that the president may try to nationalize this election, in the same way that he ran for president, as if he were running against Hillary Clinton, talking about the wall, talking about trade, talking about China, instead of really promoting all of the achievements of his administration. And let's be honest here. You cannot underestimate the political peril that this president is in if the Democrats retake the House. Say goodbye to this stock market. Say goodbye to reg reform, any chance of welfare, health care reform in the future or a second go at tax reform. We're never going to know what happened with the DOJ and the FBI if the Democrats take the House, because their only goal is to impeach him. BARTIROMO: Well, that's absolutely right. And, Gregg Jarrett, it almost feels like they are in fact waiting for the clock to run out. They're sitting on documents at the DOJ. They're not giving documents that certainly Devin Nunes and others are asking for. And if they were to run the clock out and not get this, you're not -- and the House flips -- you're not going to hear another word about this FBI-DOJ investigation. You know that. JARRETT: Oh, you're absolutely right. It'll be covered up. And -- but, of course, the Department of Justice, as you pointed out in your interview with Darrell Issa, has been obstructing Congress, and thus obstructing justice now, for the better part of a year. These are lawful subpoenas. Congress has a right to these documents. I think the president needs to step in and declassify and authorize the release of three sets of documents which the House Intelligence Committee wants and is entitled to see. BARTIROMO: Right. Yes, and the editorial board has asked him to declassify. KISSEL: Multiple times. BARTIROMO: I have said it a number of times. I don't know what the downside risk of the president declassifying these documents are, Ed? ROLLINS: There is no risk. You're fighting the intelligence community. And people always argue there's something that gives away secrets. The bottom line is, we need to give away secrets. We need to know what's going on in the Justice Department. The critical thing, going back to your point, the president can't turn the House around. Each House member has to go win his own fight, and he could talk about the good economic stuff. But we have a great shot at the send. We could pick up three or four Senate seats here. But we should have picked up 10, because there are 10 seats that were in jeopardy, but they are no longer in jeopardy. But if we can add three or four seats to the Senate, there's only three of ours that are somewhat in jeopardy, the two open seats, Arizona and Tennessee. And I think we can win those. And then Heller in Nevada is in a real race. But they have got five or six that are really vulnerable, starting with Florida, where we have a real chance of winning Florida, which we haven't in a long time. So if he goes out and campaigns hard for those candidates, that will make a difference. If he tries to do every House race that's in jeopardy, then you are going to basically create some chaos. BARTIROMO: It feels like every time you have positive news on the GOP side, the detractors come out with some other big story to sort of, oh, nothing going on here, let's look over here, Mary. KISSEL: Yes. And there's some funny business going on too. Look at the indictments. You had a representative in New York, Collins, and Duncan Hunter in California, who were indicted less than three months before the election, which is completely inappropriate. Very hard for Republicans now to put another name on the ballot in both of those areas. So, it's -- it can be a dirty business, Maria, unfortunately. BARTIROMO: It sure can. KISSEL: But an awful lot at stake in this election. BARTIROMO: There really is. Great to see everybody. ROLLINS: Thanks. BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Ed Rollins, Mary Kissel, Gregg Jarrett.  Great to have you. That will do it for us this morning on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. I will see you on \"Mornings with Maria\" from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern on the FOX Business Network weekdays. Join us. \"MediaBuzz\" with Howie Kurtz is up next after a short break.

            "article_content": "During a fundraiser in Washington D.C., liberal Democratic House candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called for all fossil fuel production to stop or else civilization has 12 years left to save the planet from catastrophe. Democratic House candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rallied an audience of supporters in Washington Thursday evening with calls to implement single-payer health care and tuition-free college \u2013 along with an appeal to stop fossil fuel production entirely. Ocasio-Cortez, who is running to represent New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District, has made no secret of her opposition to fossil fuels. She\u2019s called for politicians to forsake donations from the industry and is pushing a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d plan which entails a shift to 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. But she cast her position in stark terms Thursday, during a fundraiser at a restaurant along D.C.\u2019s hip 14th Street. \u201cThere\u2019s no debate as to whether we should continue producing fossil fuels. There\u2019s no debate. We should not,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cEvery single scientific consensus points to that.\u201d The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report earlier this week declaring that civilization only has 12 years to save the planet from \u201cclimate catastrophe.\u201d Preventative steps include reducing coal production and bringing global net emissions close to zero by 2030. However, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 position departs from that of some Democrats who advocate what the Obama administration termed an \u201call of the above\u201d energy policy \u2013 embracing oil and natural gas production, as well as the generation of renewables like wind and solar. America\u2019s natural gas production has surged in recent years, fueled in part by the fracking boom that has produced thousands of jobs and billions in revenue. While Democrats largely remain skeptical of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to revive the struggling coal industry, some \u2013 especially in states like North Dakota that stand to benefit economically \u2013 have encouraged the energy economy to embrace the natural gas boom. But fracking remains controversial for its environmental side effects, and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d envisions turning the renewable energy investment into a jobs engine \u2013 in the spirit of FDR\u2019s New Deal. During the fundraiser, she touched on several other big government plans \u2013 including universal, government-backed health and \u201ctuition-free public colleges.\u201d She railed against \u201cdark money\u201d in politics and mass incarceration for nonviolent drug offenses, an issue the Trump administration may be revisiting. \u201cThe time is always right to fight for what is right. It will never be convenient, but it is what our duty is to our future generations,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez. Ocasio-Cortez burst onto the national spotlight after beating Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley, a member of party leadership, in a primary upset. The Democratic socialist espouses a number of policies backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders like \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 \u2013 which President Trump this week attacked in an op-ed for USA Today.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Special Report with Bret Baier,\" October 10, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You don't hand matches to an arsonist, and you don't give power to an angry leftwing mob, and that's what the Democrats have become. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: They would turn our country so fast into Venezuela, and Venezuela is not doing too well, folks. ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: It is time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are, to be as dedicated as they are, to be as committed as they are. Michelle says when they go low, we go high. No, no. When they go low, we kick them. That's what this new Democratic Party is about. (END VIDEO CLIPS) BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Eric Holder in what could be a presidential run, campaigning early, we'll see. In response to that statement, Colorado Senator Cory Gardner just put out a tweet that says \"You have other party say Michelle Obama was wrong when she said when they go low we go high, but rather when they go low we kick them. This is not who we are.\" Senator Gardner pointing out that he and his family had some threats after the Kavanaugh vote. Meantime, the president tonight is campaigning in Pennsylvania, tweeting out \"Departing the White House for Erie, Pennsylvania. I cannot disappoint the thousands of people that are there and the thousands that are going. I look forward to seeing everyone this evening. Even as he has been talking about the hurricane and the recovery down in Florida, and the continuing hurricane, Michael, as we've been covering all show. Let's bring in our panel: Byron York, chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Andy McCarthy, former chief assistant U.S. attorney and contributing editor at National Review. Welcome. Byron, let me start with you. This is the politics and protests, or mobs, or anger, and how is this all playing? BRYON YORK, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: The Republicans are extremely on message now from the president on down. And it's an old message that's been used against Republicans so many times. The Democrats are extremist. They're dangerous. This is too much of a chance. They are an angry mob. They will take away your Medicare. This is a very interesting campaign that they have centered on. And talking to Republicans working to keep the House, they have had the best week or so of polling that they have had in quite a while. And they attribute most of it to the Kavanaugh effect, but also some of it to the trade victory. They felt that the president faced down Canada and won and made one of these deals that he promised he would make. So they are still scared, they are very scared, but they feeling better. BAIER: From the same sheet of music there, Mara, usually Democrats are good at that. But every day it seems like there is something that fits into this narrative that the GOP has created. Eric Holder, you have the calls for impeachment of Brett Kavanaugh, all of that. MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Right. And every time one Democrat says something like that it gets blown up by Republicans. Republicans talk about impeachment a lot more than Democrats do, net, net, net. But I think the Eric Holder cut is really important because this is a big debate going on inside of the Democratic Party. BAIER: You heard Hillary Clinton. LIASSON: Yes. Should they be Michael Avenatti Democrats? In other words, should they be the leftwing equivalent of Donald Trump, fight back just like he does? Or should they stand for something, as Michelle Obama would say, higher? They don't know which direction they want to go. There is a lot of feeling inside the Democrat Party, especially in the activist base, that Democrats are too weak. They're not tough enough. And what does toughness mean? And this is something -- and if they win, if they do take the House back, it's going to be an even more tougher debate. BAIER: Andy, your thoughts? ANDY MCCARTHY, NATIONAL REVIEW: I just worry that it's not a four-week phenomenon. We can't here do anything more than calculate how does this what's going to happen on Tuesday night four weeks from now? This is not a genie that gets easily put back in the bottle. It has the eerie feeling of the 1960s, 1970s radicalism. And it's a phase I think we're just getting into the beginning of rather than something that's going to be able to be contained in four weeks. BAIER: Clearly, we'll be covering the midterms every day for the next 27 days. I ask all the panels to choose a race that they think is interesting for one reason or another. Let's start with you. MCCARTHY: I look at the Arizona race because suddenly it's more I guess personal to me. BAIER: This is Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat, versus McSally, the Republican. MCCARTHY: Yes. The news that came out today about Sinema is that she hosted Lynn Stewart who was my adversary in the Blind Sheikh prosecution in the 1990s, rising out of the bombing of the World Trade Center. It turns out that Lynn was later on trial herself for material support to terrorism for communicating messages from the Blind Sheikh where he was in jail to his Egyptian terrorist organization. It turns out that Sinema evidently promoted two of her appearances at a university in Arizona. BAIER: We will see how that plays. Mara, your race? LIASSON: My race is the Texas Senate race that incumbent Ted Cruz, the Republican, Beto O'Rourke, the Democrat, tremendous excitement among Democrats. O'Rourke gets like crowds of 50,000. Nobody that I've talked to actually thinks that he's going to win, but the thing is he's kind of plowing the fields or fertilizing the fields in Texas for what Democrats hope will be eventually that state turning purple. They've been disappointed in the past, but this time they think they really are going to make inroads. YORK: I picked the Montana Senate race. The incumbent is the Democrat, Jon Tester. The challenger is a Republican, Matt Rosendale. I think it's the best chance for a Republican pickup that is not getting very much attention. The polls are very, very close, and Republicans are waiting for a Kavanaugh effect. They believe it is going to take place, and they don't believe you actually have to wait 28 days or 27 days until election day because early voting starts next week in Montana. So if there is another Kavanaugh effect, perhaps and when it is strongest, people will already be voting. BAIER: I wouldn't be surprised to see Air Force One stopping back in Montana as well.

Republican Bob Hugin is going nuclear against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez in the final days of the closer-than-expected New Jersey Senate race, reviving salacious\u00a0allegations that the senator had sex with underage prostitutes during past trips to the Dominican Republic. Menendez has long denied the allegations as a smear since they first surfaced on a news site in 2012. But Hugin, a wealthy pharmaceutical executive, is now running an explosive new television ad that cites papers filed in federal court by prosecutors in 2015 acknowledging the FBI probed the prostitution allegations as part of its corruption case against Menendez. \u201cIt\u2019s right here in this shocking FBI affidavit,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s Justice Department had evidence that for several years, Senator Menendez had been traveling to the Dominican Republic to engage in sexual activity with prostitutes \u2013 some of whom were minors.\u201d Prosecutors declined to bring charges related to the prostitution claims, though they did pursue a bribery case against him. A mistrial was declared last year after the jury failed to reach a verdict in that case. In 2015 court papers, prosecutors said the FBI investigated Menendez and donor Salomon Melgen after being presented \u201cwith specific, corroborated allegations\u201d they had sex with underage prostitutes, though they decided against bringing any charges on those claims. (Melgen was later convicted in a separate Medicare fraud case, and sentenced to 17 years in prison.) \u201cPresented with specific, corroborated allegations that defendants Menendez and Melgen had sex with underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, the Government responsibly and dutifully investigated those serious allegations,\u201d the papers stated, in response to claims from the defendants that the allegations were \"false\" and tainted the case. MENENDEZ FACES UNEXPECTED DANGER IN DEEP-BLUE NEW JERSEY The prosecutors also wrote: \u201cConfronted with corroborating evidence of such serious crimes, it would have been an inexcusable abdication of responsibility not to investigate these allegations.\u201d A Menendez campaign spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment from Fox News. But campaign spokesman Steve Sandberg called the ad a \u201cdisgraceful act\u201d in a statement to the Star-Ledger in New Jersey. \"It is clear that Bob Hugin will say, do and spend whatever he wants to try to deceive New Jersey voters and buy a Senate seat,\" Sandberg said. \"This is a disgraceful act by a desperate man.\u00a0They are lies and he knows it.\" The Hugin ad\u2019s narrator also takes a swing\u00a0at Menendez over claims made at the time by Menendez\u2019s lawyers, as documented in the 2015 court filing, who argued \u201csuch easily disprovable\u201d allegations of cavorting with underage prostitutes\u00a0\u201cwould hardly be a federal crime even had it been true.\u201d \u201cAs an initial matter, it is most certainly a federal crime to leave the country for the purpose of engaging in a commercial sex act with a minor, and the defendants\u2019 suggestion to the contrary is unsettling,\u201d prosecutors wrote\u00a0in response. New Jersey hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to the Senate in 46 years. But Hugin has been spending millions on negative ads reminding voters of Menendez\u2019s past ethics troubles. For the New Jersey senator, the race represents the latest in a series of dramatic fights for his political life. Had he been convicted last November, Menendez could have faced expulsion from the Senate. Having survived the trial, Menendez famously suggested he was out for vengeance. \"To those who were digging my political grave so they could jump into my seat, I know who you are and I won\u2019t forget you,\u201d the Democratic senator said last year.",

            "article_content": "In his speech, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders blasted President Trump, saying: \"We have a president, and I say this with no joy in my heart, who is a pathological liar.\" (Fox News) MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders took aim President Trump Monday morning during an appearance at Labor Day union breakfast in the state that holds the first presidential primary, but kept mum on a possible second White House bid for himself. The longtime independent senator from Vermont - who energized progressives across the country as he battled eventual Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign - sparked more speculation about his 2020 presidential ambitions as he headlined the New Hampshire AFL-CIO's annual Labor Day breakfast. In his speech, Sanders blasted Trump, saying: \"We have a president, and I say this with no joy in my heart, who is a pathological liar.\" Sanders added: \"We have a president for cheap political reasons who is trying to divide us up.\" Sanders claimed that Trump has been teaching people to \"hate other people because they may have been born in a different country, color of their skin is different, their religion is different, their sexual orientation may be different.\" Sanders also repeatedly charged that the Republican majority in the Senate and House \"are exactly on the wrong side of where the American people are.\" The Vermont lawmaker, who headlined the New Hampshire Labor Day breakfast for the fifth straight year, urged voters to stand together. \"We need to stand together and we will not allow Trump or anybody else to divide us up based on color of our skin, our religion, our nationality, or our sexual orientation,\" he said. \"When we stand together we win. When they divide us up, they win.\" Sanders, who is running for re-election in Vermont this November for a third term in the Senate, didn't make any references to the next White House race. Instead, he highlighted his progressive agenda, including his signature platforms of Medicare for all and a $15-per-hour minimum wage. \"I was in New Hampshire three years ago, coming before you and the people of this state, and I said, we need to move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer program,\" Sanders said. \"Seemed like a radical idea then. Oh my god, single payer, Medicare for all, radical idea.\" He added: \"I'm proud to tell you that legislation that I've offered in the Senate raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour now has 30 co-sponsors, and all across this country, cities and states are moving towards $15 an hour.\" The senator also pushed for strengthening Social Security, income equality and new gun laws during his speech. \"We come from rural states, New Hampshire and Vermont,\" he said. \"And a lot of our people hunt and own guns. But I believe that in our states and throughout this country, the overwhelming majority of the American people support common-sense gun safety legislation.\" Sanders crushed Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary, launching him into a months-long fight with Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Many of his top supporters from that campaign were in the audience at the Labor Day breakfast. \"I think Bernie's message is spot on - we need to come together and we'll figure out the way to do that with whomever is leading the charge,\u201d said Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, who was legal counsel and a member of the steering committee for Sanders' campaign in New Hampshire. \"It will take a little bit to work out, but I think we're going to be fine.\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his son, Levi, in New Hampshire. (Fox News) Asked if the New Hampshire voters were ready for the possibility of another White House bid by Sanders, Volinsky said, \"I think we have quite a crew. And that crew is still here and I see them at these events all the time.\" Sanders' son, Levi, a New Hampshire resident, is one of 11 Democrats currently running for the open congressional seat in the state's 1st District. However, the elder Sanders has stayed neutral in the race and has refrained from endorsing his son since Levi Sanders announced his candidacy in late February. Still, the senator did give his son a very quick shout-out near the beginning of the speech, saying, \"Let me also thank my son Levi, who is here. Levi, stand up.\"",

(Photo courtesy of campaign) A Minnesota House candidate said he suffered a concussion after he was attacked at a restaurant last week \u2013 all because of his political beliefs.

FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS HEADQUARTERS \u201cWhile I had never met my assailant, the words he yelled at me before he attacked me lead me to believe his actions were politically motivated,\u201d Mekeland said in a Facebook post. \u201cWhen I chose to run for office, I expected to be politically attacked, but never physically.\u201d \u201cI weighed whether or not to share this today, but ultimately I think we all need a reminder to be civil to each other regardless of our perspectives,\u201d he said. CALIFORNIA MAN \u2018HEINOUSLY\u2019 ATTACKED WHILE PLACING ROAD SIGNS FOR GOP CONGRESSMAN In response to a comment on the post, Mekeland blamed \u201cthe media and the likes of Maxine Waters, Hillary [Clinton] and Eric Holder\u201d for \u201cdriving this behavior.\u201d Benton County is located in the middle of Minnesota, just northeast of St. Cloud. Mekeland faces Democrat Karla Scapanski and independent Myron Wilson in the election. Police said the investigation is ongoing.",

            "article_content": " Early voting numbers from several key battleground states now show Republican voters turning out in far greater numbers than Democratic ones, signaling an initial GOP surge that may dull the prospects of a so-called \"blue wave\" on Nov. 6. Republican voters have taken the lead in turnout numbers in\u00a0Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Texas, Tennessee, Florida\u00a0and Arizona -- states that Fox News analyses show\u00a0are the scenes of close and pivotal\u00a0House, Senate\u00a0and gubernatorial races. The results are most striking in Tennessee, where 63 percent of early voters are affiliated with the Republican Party, compared to only 30 percent aligned with the Democrats, according to one\u00a0review\u00a0of publicly available voting data conducted by NBC News. Earlier this month, pop star Taylor Swift told her 110 million followers on Instagram that they should participate in early voting\u00a0--\u00a0just a week after she wrote that Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn \"appalls and terrifies\" her, and declared that Democrat Phil Bredesen has her unequivocal support. But neither of Swift's calls to action appears to have been effective, based on early voting totals. Republicans are similarly outpacing Democrats by 11 points in Arizona, 6 points in Florida, 9 points in Georgia, 12 points in Indiana, 17 points in Montana\u00a0and 10 points in Texas, the analysis shows. While results do not indicate which candidates or political party actually\u00a0received the votes,\u00a0analysts say it's common for more partisan voters to cast their ballots\u00a0early. The balance could shift as Election Day draws closer, but the numbers are noteworthy considering Democrats often outperform the GOP in in-person early voting -- and vice-versa for absentee. FIVE 'OCTOBER SURPRISES' THAT COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING BEFORE ELECTION DAY The only state in which Democrats are edging out Republicans in early voting is Nevada, where they hold a 45-to-38 percent lead. Democrats have performed particularly well in Washoe County, which includes Reno:\u00a0Democrats are leading Republicans by a margin of 9,150 to 7,071 in in-person early voting, although Republicans have a lead of about 600 votes in absentee and mail-in ballots. Democrats' performance in Washoe during the first three days of early voting is particularly notable because Republicans hold an edge in voter registration there (99,675 to 94,520), but\u00a0strong Republican performance in absentee ballots, coupled with a surge in rural votes during that period, was giving Democrats cause for concern. \"Three straight days of decisive Dem victories is stunning, but as the president often says: Let\u2019s see what happens,\" wrote Jon Ralston, the editor of\u00a0The Nevada Independent, who has\u00a0called Washoe the \"swing county\"\u00a0in Nevada. \"Democrats' late dominance in the air wars could produce several Election Night surprises.\" Based on a review of the entire state's voting data, Ralston concluded that even though turnout so far is unusually high,\u00a0\u00a0\"it does not appear yet to be a wave election, as it was in 2014 (red) and 2016 (blue).\" Total voting numbers are about three-quarters of the turnout during a presidential election year, Ralston said. \"More people usually vote in the second week than the first, and trends do not reverse,\" Ralston told Fox News over the weekend.\u00a0\"But this is not a usual year. ... We will know more in two or three days.\" GOP NOW ON THE OFFENSIVE IN SEVERAL MAJOR SENATE RACES AS TIDE APPEARS TO TURN Nevada has played host to high-profile visits on behalf of both parties' candidates in recent days, although attendance numbers have been lopsided.\u00a0President Trump's rally on Saturday in Elko County, Nevada, drew approximately four times the number of attendees as former President Obama's own rally in the state Monday. Obama took credit for the nation's booming economy\u00a0during his speech, apparently seeking to blunt what has become one of Republicans' main points of emphasis. The Elko Daily Free Press reported that Trump\u00a0spoke to roughly 8,500 supporters\u00a0at a regional airport in the northeastern Nevada mining town, while Obama addressed a crowd of roughly 2,000 at the Cox Pavilion at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, ABC News reported. Still, history advises caution when considering early voting totals and on-the-ground indicators. In the 2016 presidential election, early voting trends were suggestive of Democratic strength in Florida, North Carolina, and Nevada. In the end, Hillary Clinton only carried Nevada. TRUMP COMMITS TO NEW 10-PERCENT\u00a0MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY, SLAMS\u00a0 CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES FOR FAILING TO STOP MIGRANT CARAVAN And there were\u00a0signs, in polling and in fundraising, that Democrats will have a strong showing in the House, even as the Senate increasingly looks like a lock for Republicans to retain or even expand their majority. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report on Tuesday said\u00a0eight House races had become more favorable for Democrats, while only two had shifted towards the Republican column. \"An astounding 112 Democrats outraised GOP opponents in Republican-held seats between July and September,\" The Cook Political Report's\u00a0David Wasserman wrote Tuesday.\u00a0\"Of the 93 GOP incumbents who were outraised, 20 are currently in our Likely Republican column and 23 in Solid Republican. Democrats' late dominance in the air wars could produce several Election Night surprises.\" Wasserman continued: \"We continue to believe anywhere from a 20 to 40 seat Democratic gain is possible, but right now the likeliest outcome is a Democratic gain of between 25 and 35 seats.\"\u00a0 (Democrats need to flip 24 Republican-held seats to retake a majority in the House, and 25 backed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016.) Meanwhile, a recent poll conducted by\u00a0NBC News and The Wall Street Journal poll gave both sides cause for celebration. While the poll indicated that Democrats have a 4 percentage point edge over Republicans in midterm election interest, that figure stood at approximately 10 percent from January through September -- before divisive issues like the incoming migrant caravan from Central America and the contentious confirmation battle over Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh took center stage. The poll also showed that President Trump's approval rating is up to 47 percent, the highest number he's notched while in office. That's a three-point jump from his standing in September.

This is a rush transcript from \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" July 1, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good Sunday morning. Now my exclusive sit-down interview with President Trump. The president talks tough on trade, slams the Democrats over immigration and their push to abolish ICE. And he hints at who he may nominate to be the next Supreme Court justice. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining me this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Justice Anthony Kennedy announces his retirement, sparking a fierce political battle on Capitol Hill and across the country about his replacement. President Trump now getting another historic opportunity to reshape the high court and affect key issues, including Roe vs. Wade. We will hear what the president has to say about Kennedy's legacy and what kind of judge he plans to nominate on July 9. ICE is now at the center of the fight over immigration, as Democrats ramp up their calls to get rid of the controversial agency. Why the president believes that will help Republicans win in the midterms if the left makes it a campaign issue. And, as trade tensions escalate with China and Europe, I ask the president how he plans to push back on unfair trade practice and keep Beijing from stealing American innovation. All that right now, and a lot more, in my exclusive interview with President Trump, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" After an incredibly busy week in our nation's capital and for the country, I sat down for an exclusive interview with President Trump. The conversation covering everything from his upcoming Supreme Court pick to the debate over tariffs and phase two of his plan for the economy. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: Mr. President, thanks so much for sitting down with me today. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, thank you very much. BARTIROMO: I want to start right with the breaking news of the week, and that is Justice Anthony Kennedy announcing his retirement. Is Justice Kennedy the model of the person you would put on the Supreme Court now? TRUMP: Maybe so. He's a great gentleman. He's a very-high-quality person. You know, I got a call, Maria, that somebody would like to see me. And they were sort of, like, acting anonymous. I said, wait a minute. I'm the president of the United States. How can I see somebody I don't know who it is? Anyway, I figured it out. And it was a very elegant moment. It was a beautiful moment. He presented me with a letter. And it really is a retirement of a great gentleman. He's a fine, fine gentleman, and really did a -- I think he did a very -- he was -- ended up being a little more neutral than a lot of people would have preferred, but a lot of people preferred that he was. And we're going to pick somebody who is outstanding. And I said I will do it in your honor, but we're going to pick somebody who is outstanding. And I was very honored that he did this during my term, which means he had confidence in me to do the right thing. BARTIROMO: Are you going to ask your nominees beforehand how they might vote on Roe vs. Wade? TRUMP: Well, that's a big one, and probably not. They're all saying, don't do that, you don't do that, you shouldn't do that. But I'm putting conservative people on. And I'm very proud of Neil Gorsuch. He's been outstanding. His opinions are so well-written, so brilliant. And I'm going to try and do something like that, but I don't think I'm going to be so specific in the questions I will be answering. And I'm actually told that I shouldn't be. BARTIROMO: Because, on the campaign trail, you said you would leave it to the states? TRUMP: Well, maybe someday it will be to the states. You never know how that's going to turn out. That's a very complex question. The Roe v. Wade is probably the one that people are talking about in terms of having an effect. But we will see what happens. But it could very well end up with states at some point. BARTIROMO: And do you think you will be able to get your nominee in place before the midterm elections? TRUMP: I think it is going to go very quickly. I think we're going to have a lot of support. I think we are going to have support from Democrats, frankly, I think, if it's the right person. I'm going to pick the right person. I'm going to pick somebody that's outstanding. And everybody on that list is outstanding, but I'm going to pick somebody who is outstanding. And I think -- yes, I think we will go very quickly. I actually believe that. A lot of people think it is going to be a very long -- it is probably going to be vicious, because the other side, all they can do is obstruct and resist. You know, their whole thing is resist. But -- and maybe someday we will be able to get along with the other side. I don't know. But, right now, it is only resist. That's all they want to do, is stop things from happening. So they are going to try very hard. But I think it is going to go actually very quickly, if I pick the right person. BARTIROMO: Mr. President, here we are six months after you signed into law a historic tax reform package. TRUMP: Yes. BARTIROMO: First time in 30 years. Has the effect been what you expected? TRUMP: Well, I think there's a double effect. The tax cuts have been incredible, and reform, don't forget, but tax cuts have been incredible. BARTIROMO: And the rollback in regulations. Huge. TRUMP: But I think the big thing -- I actually think, maybe at least initially speaking, because it's been earlier, took place quicker, the regulation rollback has been the biggest ever in the history of our country. No -- no president, even during full terms, has cut back anywhere near what I have done. And we have more to do. Now, we're going to have regulation. We're going to have clean water. We're going to have, you know, clean air. We're going to have the cleanest water, cleanest air. But we are -- we have more regulation-cutting to do. BARTIROMO: So... TRUMP: But I think that may have had a bigger impact to this point. I think, ultimately, the tax cuts, as they kick in -- and they are kicking in very -- you see the kind of hundreds of billions of dollars brought back into the country already. I think, ultimately, that's going to be something really special. And you're seeing the result right now. BARTIROMO: I agree you, because, under President Obama, the federal registry pages were up to 97,000 pages... TRUMP: Yes. BARTIROMO: ... or something like that. TRUMP: Honestly, if the Democrats would have won the election, first of all, you would have a lot of different -- if you look at the last four decisions on the Supreme Court, at 5-4, they would have all been reversed. The union decision was a massive decision. The -- you know, you can look at any one of those four, they were all so big, so important. And they would have been exactly reversed. So many -- that's why I have always heard that, as president, I mean, obviously, outside of war and peace, the biggest decision you can make is the selection of a Supreme Court justice. And I see it. And you see it so vividly over the last two days, because, I mean, those decisions would have all gone the other way. BARTIROMO: And your legacy on the conservative party, on the GOP, is going to be massive, obviously, with this very consequential decision-making that you need to do. TRUMP: Right. BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about what's next, because we have seen the impact to the economy. What do you want to see happen now? Does the economy need even more stimulus? Are you looking for a phase two tax cut? TRUMP: We're doing a phase two. We will be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that. And it will be more of a middle class. We did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we're thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20. And then, for the most part, the rest of it would go right to the middle class. It's a great stimulus. And one of the things I'm doing that you have been reporting on -- although I'm not sure that you're a believer, but I think you are getting there -- look what's happening with the steel companies. They are doing -- they are expanding. They are going wild. And we need steel. And we need aluminum. And we need solar panels. And, you know, the same thing with solar panels -- it was like a dead business, and we did a 30 percent tariff, because they were dumping all over the place. And washing machines, doesn't sound very glamorous. It is actually a very big business. But if you look at what's happened to steel and aluminum, we practically built a new industry in a period of four, five months. It is incredible, what's happening. But the big thing that I'm focused on now is trade. I have to straighten out trade deals. Maria, we have trade deals -- as an example, with China, we don't even have a trade deal with China. We don't have a deal. Nobody bothered to make a deal. And they will charge 25 percent for a car, and we charge 2.5 percent. And you have used those numbers on your show, so I don't want to bore people. But we have a -- some of the -- we have the worst trade deals in the world. We lose money with everybody. You know, when somebody walks in, I say, how much do we lose with this country? We lose with everybody. We are going to make it reciprocal. We are going to make them fair. And I will tell you that you don't know about this, but every country is calling every day, saying, let's make a deal, let's make a deal. It is all going to work out. BARTIROMO: And the markets feel like they're trusting you at this point, saying... TRUMP: I think they trust me. And the farmers trust me. BARTIROMO: They do. TRUMP: Don't forget, the farmers -- and I won all the farmers. I won that whole -- you look at a map, it's a got a little blue on the outside, everything else is red And it's beautiful color red. But I have to say that, if you look at what's happened with farms, over 15 years, it's just the steady decline. Over the last five -- I've been here a year-and-a-half. Over the last five years, they have been very bad years for farms and farmers. I said, we have to change that. And one of the reasons is because they have barriers. These aren't even economic barriers, although, in Canada's case, 275 percent tariff for dairy. That's not fair. BARTIROMO: So, when would you expect your most significant deal? TRUMP: Well, I already pretty much finished the deal with South Korea. It was terrible deal. Remember, it was going to produce 200,000 jobs? And they were right -- for South Korea, not for us. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That's done. NAFTA, I could sign it tomorrow, but I'm not happy with it. I want to make it more fair, OK? I want to make... BARTIROMO: You can't do NAFTA before the midterms. TRUMP: I want to wait until after the election. You're going to have an election. It's going to be very interesting. I have a feeling he's going to be fine. And the reason is because, if they're not fine, I'm going to tax their cars coming into America, and that's the big one. You know, the cars are the big one. We can talk steel. We can talk everything. The big thing is the cars. BARTIROMO: A -- a major lobbying group for the auto industry says that your administration's threatened 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles will amount to $45 billion in taxes on consumers and wipe out any benefits of the tax cut plans for low- and middle-income American. TRUMP: Well, actually, it's 20 percent. Tell them to get their numbers right. Look, Maria, what's going to really happen is, there's going to be no tax. You know why? They're going to build their cars in America. They're going to make them here. We bring in millions and millions of cars a year. We charge 2.5 percent. Some of these countries don't even take our cars. If we want to send General Motors or any of our companies to some of these countries, they won't take our cars. They have a barrier. They put up a barrier, non-monetary barrier. They call it non-monetary tariff. And the barrier is so strong, you can't sell a car. If you do sell a car, it's 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent. And we get 2.5 percent, and nobody pays it. BARTIROMO: Yes. Would you agree, though, that a tariff is a sales tax? I mean, even Steve Forbes was on my show last week. He said, look, for every job you're creating in the aluminum and steel industry, you're losing 15 in the industries that import aluminum and steel. TRUMP: OK. You have to remember... BARTIROMO: Is it a sales tax? TRUMP: First of all, I love free trade. Do you know, when I was at the G7, I said, I have an idea, everybody. I'll guarantee you we'll do it immediately. Nobody pay anymore tax, everybody take down your barriers. No barriers, no tax. Everybody, are you all set? No more tax. Canada, you're not going to get 275 percent for your dairy, and you're going to take down all your barriers. We're going to take all our barriers. We're going to down all our taxes, right? You know what happened? Everybody said, \"Uh, can we get onto another subject?\" Because America, our country, lost last year $817 billion in terms of deficit. We had a trade deficit, Maria, of 817 billion -- with a B -- dollars last year. Before that, it was $800 billion. This has been going on for years. We have rebuilt China. I have a great relationship with China, great relationship with President Xi. I have tremendous respect for him. But I said, We have to straighten this out. We can't continue to do this. BARTIROMO: Well, you decided to not go forward with the investment restrictions on China. TRUMP: No, no, we're going forward. BARTIROMO: Are you going to back down on the tariffs against China? TRUMP: No, no, no, no. No. Look, we're in for -- you know, we've put in $250 billion worth of product. The tariffs are -- in fact, it could go up to 500, frankly, if we don't make a deal. And they want to make a deal. I will tell you, China wants to make a deal. And so do I, but it's got to be a fair deal for this country. One of the hard things is, our presidents and our business leaders, they were missing in action -- not so much the business leaders. You know, some business leaders benefit by allowing this stuff to go on. That's the problem. They benefit. They're more for their business than they are for the United States. I had a great company, the head of a great company come up to me. He's very seriously affected by the tariffs. He said: \"Mr. President, it's not for me right now. Ultimately, it is, but you're doing the right thing on tariffs.\" One of the -- one of the greatest... BARTIROMO: Well, you're doing the right thing on pushing back on China as well. TRUMP: I have to. BARTIROMO: Most people understand that they've been stealing from us for decades. TRUMP: Right, right. BARTIROMO: But you didn't go forward with this ban on Chinese nationals acquiring a 25 percent stake in American companies that are in this China 2025. But now people want to know, how are you going to protect American innovation, technology, the crown jewel? TRUMP: So, we're doing it through CFIUS. We're doing it through different things. But -- but what I didn't like was pinpointing China, because it's not fair. I get along with China. I like the president. He's president for life. We can call him the king, right? But I like the president. I didn't like pinpointing China. I don't think it's fair, because they're not the only ones. Now, they're bigger and stronger. And, frankly, they do it more. And they're probably a bigger violator. But it's other countries too. And I wanted to go worldwide. And we are doing that. So, actually, what I'm doing is a very similar thing. But I want it to pertain to everybody. So, you mean China can't -- China can't do it, but other countries can? Now, I know China, and I know how smart they are. They'll send their people into other counties and do it through other counties. And they'll just go through an extra process. BARTIROMO: That's why you had to do it on everybody, even our friends. TRUMP: I want -- I want everybody to do it. Same thing with the tariffs on the steel. If we don't have it on everybody, then what happens is, they -- you know, they put it through these other countries that don't have it, and you're wasting a lot of time. (END VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: We will take a short break. Up next, the president will talk about the escalating trade disputes with China and the European Union. Much more of my exclusive sit-down interview with President Trump coming up. Tomorrow, on FOX Business Network, join me again, an encore presentation on \"Mornings With Maria\" of my discussion with the president. I hope you will join me tomorrow morning from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Stay with us. Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures. Let us know your reaction, as we react with a panel at the end of the show, right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We continue now with my exclusive sit-down with President Trump. We talked about tariffs and the trade showdown with our European allies, among others, also how we are combating the threat of Beijing stealing American technology and innovation. More now on my exclusive interview. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: If we're trying to stop China from stealing from us, which we know is happening, and that business knows it across the board... TRUMP: Yes. Yes. It's true. It's happening. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: By the way, $300 billion a year, they say. That's a lot of money. BARTIROMO: Exactly. Would it be better to actually have our allies together to go against China, instead of... TRUMP: No. BARTIROMO: ... pushing back on our allies, like European nations? TRUMP: Because -- because the allies -- excuse me. The European Union is possibly as bad as China, just smaller, OK? It's terrible, what they do to us. European Union, take a look at the car situation. They send a Mercedes in. We can't send our cars in. Look what they do to our farmers. They don't want our farm products. Now, in all fairness, they have their farmers. So, they want to protect their farmers. But we don't protect ours, and they protect theirs. The European Union last year made, if you look at a trade surplus, which I think is a very important thing, $151 billion. Now, we all sort of love the European Union. You know, I was there many, many years ago, meaning, my parents were born in the European Union, but before there was a... BARTIROMO: Right. They love you... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No. And I -- I love those counties. BARTIROMO: Right. TRUMP: Germany, and all of the countries, Scotland -- you know, you have Scotland. They're still in there. They're still hanging in there, right? We will see what happens with Brexit. BARTIROMO: Right. TRUMP: But -- but they treat us very badly. They treat us very unfairly. BARTIROMO: I know. No, you've said that. And it has resonated. TRUMP: Maria, they don't take our product. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Excuse me. I can say it better, in a different way. They made last year $151 billion in trade surplus. BARTIROMO: On America. TRUMP: In other words, we had a deficit with the European Union. On top of that, we spend a fortune on NATO to protect them. (END VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: President Trump weighs in on the emotionally charged issue of immigration next and a push by Democrats to abolish ICE. Much more of my exclusive interview with President Trump coming up, as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More now with my exclusive interview with President Trump. The president turning his attention to Harley-Davidson, while talking about tariffs. He also spoke about the role immigration will play in the upcoming midterm elections and how some Democrats and their call to abolish ICE could ultimately be a downfall. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: I saw you in Wisconsin yesterday, and you called out Harley- Davidson. And you've been calling out Harley -- Harley-Davidson. TRUMP: It's true. I don't like that they're leaving. They're not leaving, but... BARTIROMO: But, look, Harley-Davidson is saying, we're going to send some production overseas... TRUMP: I don't like it. BARTIROMO: ... because we can't deal with the retaliatory tariffs out of Europe. And that's because of our tariffs. TRUMP: Maria... BARTIROMO: Should you be calling out specific companies? You're the president. TRUMP: Yes. Yes, I should. Look, I devoted a lot of time to Harley-Davidson. I treated them good. I guarantee you, everybody that ever bought a Harley-Davidson voted for Trump. I don't know if you know that. I would have to -- they call them bikers for Trump. There's -- there's hundreds. BARTIROMO: And there's pride that it's built in America. I know that. TRUMP: And they're -- and they're very unhappy about it. They are very unhappy. Now, we just proposed this a few days ago. They made this deal at the beginning of the year, long before they ever heard of the word tariff. They made this deal at the beginning of the year. And I don't think they should do it. I think that Harley is an American bike. It's an American motorcycle. And they should build them in this country. They shouldn't play cute. And I had them for lunch six months ago. BARTIROMO: I remember. TRUMP: And they were telling me, in India, they charge 100 per... BARTIROMO: A hundred percent. You said that. TRUMP: Do you want to know... (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: And I was talking about... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I think I taught them more about tariffs than I could ever learn. I was saying, let me ask you a question. How much do you pay in India? One hundred percent. Oh, really? Do you do much business? No. Why? Because the tariff's too high. I'm the one telling them. I said, that's a shame. I got them to reduce the tariffs in India, because I used that as an example. All of the sudden, Harley leaves. Everyone else is coming in. BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP: You know, they are one of the few that's -- everyone else is coming in. I have feeling that maybe Harley, I think they're going to take a big hit. I just think it's a great American product. And our people have more pride then they used to have. I really believe that Harley's going to take a -- the people that are buying Harley-Davidson, you know, they don't want -- they don't want it built in another country. BARTIROMO: That's true. TRUMP: And -- no, they don't want it. BARTIROMO: I know that. I know that. TRUMP: I know those people. BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP: Those are my voters. BARTIROMO: No, no, they have pride that their bike is built in America. There's no doubt about it. TRUMP: Those are my voters. They don't want Harley-Davidson getting cute to make $2 more. BARTIROMO: All of these issue are going to be issues in the midterms, including immigration. Is immigration and these pictures of separated families going to hurt the Republicans come November? TRUMP: No. First of all, I signed an executive order last week saying, I don't want families broken up. Nobody else did that. BARTIROMO: Did our first lady, Melania, encourage you to do that? TRUMP: She's been there, and she's been out to the border twice. And she... BARTIROMO: What has she told you about that? TRUMP: I'll tell you, she came home and told me a couple of things very -- she said, it's a very sad situation, very, very sad. She was really impressed with Border Patrol, how professional they were. She came and said that. And she was really saddened by the plight of people. I mean, you know, she has a very big heart. She went down -- this is her second time in a week-and-a-half. She feels it. But she was so strong on how professional the Border Patrol, the agents, the law enforcement is along the border. She couldn't believe it. BARTIROMO: Meanwhile... TRUMP: And she saw the danger. She saw the danger -- you look at -- it just looks like danger. In the meantime, we have to have strong border protection. We have to have strong borders. We don't want crime. The Democrats want to have no borders. They want to get rid of ICE. You know, ICE is the one... BARTIROMO: Well, this is exactly -- I was just going to say that. TRUMP: Yes. BARTIROMO: The 28-year-old socialist that just beat out Joe Crowley... TRUMP: Yes. Yes. BARTIROMO: ... says abolish ICE. And get this. More Democrats are getting in line with that, Kirsten Gillibrand today saying, we need to abolish ICE. TRUMP: Well, I hope they keep thinking about it, because they're going to get beaten so badly. Do you know ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13, and they take them out, because they're much tougher than MS-13, like, by a factor of 10. And these are the ones. You get rid of ICE, you're going to have a country that you're going to be afraid to walk out of your house. I love that issue, if they're going to actually do that. They're seriously talking about that? Because they -- you are going to have a county that's crime-ridden. The Border Patrol, the Border Patrol agents, ICE, these people are incredible. They were the ones -- actually, when Melania went down, she -- she was talking about the Border Patrol agents, not the ICE, because she doesn't see. But ICE, Border Patrol, these are incredible patriots. The job they have is so dangerous. BARTIROMO: I know. TRUMP: You know Long Island very well, right? BARTIROMO: Well, catch and release, I mean... TRUMP: Well, how about Long Island? BARTIROMO: Right. TRUMP: They go into Long Island, they -- they actually liberate towns. They liberate towns. These are incredible people. If the Democrats go left, OK, if they do that, like I always say, Maxine Waters is -- you know, Maxine Waters is their new leader. Between Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, and getting rid of ICE, and having open borders -- and the biggest thing, you have open borders. All it's going to do is lead to massive, massive crime. That's going to be their platform, open borders, which equals crime. I think they'll never win another election. So, I'm actually quite happy about it. (END VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: Up next, we go international. Stay with me for more of my exclusive interview with President Trump -- why the president says he believes North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, is serious about denuclearization. More coming up on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. In my exclusive interview with President Trump, we touched on the ongoing negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear program, rising oil prices and how the president can bring the country together as the political rhetoric grows more extreme. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: Let me ask you real quick on North Korea and Iran, because -- how was the summit? Can you give us any anecdotes? TRUMP: OK. BARTIROMO: I mean, now we're -- we're supposed to find out -- I've spoken to some -- with some military men of my own. And they told us that -- told me that North Korea needs to tell us exactly where their facilities are so that we can inspect them -- (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: -- within the next couple of weeks. If we don't find out in the next couple of weeks -- (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: -- we know they're not serious about this. What are you going to do? TRUMP: Oh, I think they're very serious about it. I think they want to do -- we had a very good chemistry. You know, we had a lot points -- we want (ph) a lot of different points. Not to go over them, but denuclearization, getting our -- getting the remains back from great heroes, great people. So many different things. BARTIROMO: But are we to (ph) legitimizing killers? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: By the way, excuse me (ph), getting the hostages back before I even went -- (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: That was incredible. Thank you for doing that, Mr. President. TRUMP: I know. But think of -- think of this. What did I do, really, when you think about it? I went there. So the papers say he went. Oh. Meaning I went to Singapore. So we had a meeting. We didn't do anything. Now, we're saving a lot of money by not doing -- I asked -- I said let's not do the -- I call them the war games, OK? They're dropping bombs all over the place every six months. It's unbelievably expensive to do that. The planes fly in from Guam, these massive, you know, bombers. And all of our -- they're flying in from bomb, going back -- from Guam. It's crazy. So -- we gave nothing. What we are going to give is good things in the future. And -- and by the way, I really believe North Korea has a tremendous future. I got along really well with Chairman Kim. We had a great chemistry. We really had -- Chairman Kim -- BARTIROMO: But do we believe him, Mr. President? TRUMP: I made a deal with him. I shook hands with him. I really believe he means it. BARTIROMO: OK. TRUMP: Now, is it possible? Have I been in deals -- have you been in things where people didn't work out? It's possible. But -- BARTIROMO: Well you made a -- well you made a bold decision on Iran. I mean, this was incredible. TRUMP: And Iran -- look what's happening in Iran. BARTIROMO: And look what's happening now. The strikes and the protests. The people want economic freedom. TRUMP: Iran's a different place. Iran's a different place. BARTIROMO: So is it true that -- TRUMP: Iran's no longer thinking about the Mediterranean and going through -- they're thinking about themselves. They're having riots all over -- BARTIROMO: Are they enriching their uranium like the reports say? TRUMP: If they do, they're going to have a very big problem. BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the secondary sanctions. Will you sanction European companies if they do business with Iran? TRUMP: Yes. Of course. That's what we're doing. Absolutely. BARTIROMO: And -- and -- and in terms of oil prices -- you've talked about oil prices a lot. Do you think somebody's manipulating this market? TRUMP: 100 percent. 100 percent. BARTIROMO: Above $70 now. TRUMP: OPEC is and they're going to stop it. BARTIROMO: OPEC is. TRUMP: Because we're protecting those countries -- many of those countries. OPEC is manipulating. And you know, they allowed less than we thought last week. They have to put out another $2 million barrels in my opinion. Because we don't want that happening. Don't forget, the one negative to the Iran deal is you're going to lose a lot of oil and they got to make up for it. And who's their big enemy? Iran. OK? You think of it. Iran's their big -- so they're going to have to do it. And I have a very good relationship with the king and with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the others around. And they're going to have to put out more oil. BARTIROMO: Any -- any comments on Peter Strzok and these testimonies that we're seeing? Rod Rosenstein, Christopher Wray. Why don't you just direct your subordinates to get those documents over to Congress? Are you going to do it? TRUMP: So I have this country running like a top. Mike Pompeo is doing great. We really have a great group of people. The one thing I want to stay uninvolved in -- at least for now. I may get involved. BARTIROMO: OK. TRUMP: But I've been told by so many people don't get involved. BARTIROMO: Congress wants those documents. TRUMP: You know, all those people got involved and it's not good. And they'll get the documents and it's getting -- and they're getting them and they're great people. I didn't like the scene the other day where everybody's screaming at each other. You know, I don't like that because it's bad for the country. You know, if Russia is in fact looking to sew discord, or chaos, they've got to be saying this is the greatest thing we've ever done. OK? Now, there's no collusion with me, there's no Russia with me, there's no nothing. BARTIROMO: I know. TRUMP: It's a -- it's -- honestly, it's a disgrace. But I purposely said I'm not getting involved, let it just go. You know, they found nothing. Nobody has found anything. BARTIROMO: I know. Are you going to -- TRUMP: And by the way, this is the most transparent thing ever done with the White House. I think I gave them a million four hundred thousand documents. I told them -- I -- look (ph), don't even read them. There's no Russia mention or anything like that. BARTIROMO: Right. Right. TRUMP: They have nothing. I don't like to see that kind of fighting. It's terrible. BARTIROMO: Are you going to mention -- TRUMP: It's bad for both sides. BARTIROMO: Are you going to mention the meddling when you meet with Russian president Vladimir Putting July 16? TRUMP: I'll mention it. I'm going to mention it (ph). I'd like to see some handshakes (ph) (inaudible) as to why we didn't take the server -- why the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC -- (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: Well the DNC wanted to give it to a private company. TRUMP: No. Can you believe it? BARTIROMO: They didn't want to give it to the FBI: TRUMP: No, no. Can you believe it? Now, why didn't the FBI take it? Look what they did to other people. Why didn't they take it? How can the DNC say, \"get out of here.\" They threw them out of the office. BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, the same people running both investigations. I mean, that's why - TRUMP: Did you ever see a difference in two investigations? And the difference is - BARTIROMO: There was a huge difference - TRUMP: - this one here did nothing wrong. There was no collusion, no nothing. The other one - and I'm not saying one way or the other, but you go back one. How about the e-mails, the leading 33,000 e-mails. BARTIROMO: Right. TRUMP: Just didn't finish it (ph). We don't even have to talk about the uranium and all the different things. Just tell me, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena from the United States Congress, right, people go to jail for doing it under a civil case. They delete 33,000 e- mails. BARTIROMO: And some of them got immunity. TRUMP: Got immunity before the FBI even walked in. They walk in say you have a - and by the way, keep your laptops, and did they even say, \"destroy your laptops,\" or something? \"In a week you can destroy your laptops?\" BARTIROMO: (Inaudible) Final question, Mr. President. Here, we see your lovely Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders, getting asked to leave a restaurant. We see Peter Fonda, Robert De Niro having Trump syndrome, they're going crazy, all of this betrayal in this country. As the Commander in Chief, as the president of this great country, what can you do to bring us together? TRUMP: Well, some of them do it for publicity. I hate to say it. Some of them do it for publicity. Now, the Hen Restaurant was - I thought was terrible with Sarah. I thought it was terrible. I think - BARTIROMO: It's all terrible. TRUMP: I think some of the things that are said are terrible. And, you know, it's our people are so incredible (ph) - you know, there's probably never been a base in the history of politics in this country like my base. I hope the other side realizes that they better just take it easy. They better just take it easy because some of the languages, some of the words you - even some of the radical ideas, I really think they're very bad for the country. I think they're actually very dangerous for the country. (Inaudible) - BARTIROMO: All the while, you're creating economic growth and you're creating job opportunities. TRUMP: So if you look at black unemployment, the best in history. Hispanic unemployment, the best in history, lowest in the history of our country. Women, 64, 65 years - the best in 65 years. Within two weeks, it should be the best in history. Women unemployment, meaning it's low, so low, so beautiful. Our unemployment picture overall generally is almost the best in history. Our numbers are among - it's going to be interesting to see what happens in the next quarter, but, you know, the - I don't know if you saw, but the Atlanta Fed predicted 4.8. I don't know if it's going to be - BARTIROMO: Of course I saw. TRUMP: 4.8, I actually saw it on your show, so I guess you (inaudible) - BARTIROMO: Thank you. TRUMP: - weren't watching. Maybe somebody else was - BARTIROMO: (inaudible) on the show. TRUMP: But the Atlanta Fed predicted 4.6, and then they upped it to 4.8. BARTIROMO: Right. TRUMP: I don't know if that's true, but each point is $3 trillion and 10 million jobs, and you know that when I originally took over, it was 1.2, and it was heading down because they would have put more restrain - we talked about the regulations and restrictions. They would have put more regulations on. There wouldn't have been any tax cuts. For the tax cuts, we didn't get one Democrat vote. Now add this to it. Part of their platform, one other thing they want to do, they want to raise the taxes. They want to end the tax cuts, take the money back, and they want to raise the taxes. I don't think that's a very good formula for the country, number one, most importantly, it's also not a good formula to get elected. BARTIROMO: And you think this is going to be the key that will drive voters in the November election. Well, I think the tax cuts are going to be important. I think the regulations are going to be important. I think the success - BARTIROMO: You feeling good about the midterm? TRUMP: Honestly, I feel actually good. The only thing I feel bad about is that I guess 93 percent of the time, whoever wins the presidency tends to do not so good in the midterms. Other than that, we have - this may be -hey, look. You do this for a living and nobody does it better. This may be the greatest economy we've ever had. So if it's all about the economy, I think we should do phenomenally. I think we're going to do great. I think we're going to do great in the Senate. You know, I visited three states in the last six days. I think every one of those people have an awfully good chance of winning. I think we're going to do great in the Senate, and I think we're going to do absolutely fine in the House. BARTIROMO: I think you love going back to the campaign rally. TRUMP: I do like it. I mean, I - BARTIROMO: You like, you know, energizing the crowd. TRUMP: I love those people. BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP: I just love the people of this country. They are great. BARTIROMO: They see it. TRUMP: They are great. BARTIROMO: Mr. President, it's great to see you. TRUMP: Thank you. BARTIROMO: Thanks very much for joining us. TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you, Maria. BARTIROMO: Appreciate it. (END VIDEO CLIP) And my thanks to President Trump for joining us. You just heard the president mention oil prices, yesterday he tweeted this, he says just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that because of turmoil and dysfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I'm asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production maybe up to 2 million barrels a day to make up for the difference. Prices too high, he has agreed. Now last night, the White House issued a statement saying that the Saudi king agreed to raise output if needed, and they made no mention of a specific amount that was pledged however. We're going to react to that interview right now, we've got our panel on deck joining me to talk about that exclusive sit down with President Trump, I will get their thoughts on the looming Supreme Court decision, and whether immigration will be a winning issue for Republicans in November or not. We are looking ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures\", we're back in two minutes time. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) Welcome back, we are zeroing in on that exclusive interview with President Trump. Let's bring in our panel, Ed Rollins is former Reagan Bush campaign manager, he is a Fox News contributor. Al D'Amato is former Republican senator from New York and a Fox News contributor. And Alan Dershowitz, law profession emeritus at Harvard Law School, and the author of \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump\". Gentlemen, good to see you all, thank you so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. And Alan Dershowitz, I want to kick it off with you because of this Supreme Court story, he as very specific in terms of Roe v. Wade, said he's not going to ask these nominees their opinion on that before nominating them. Your take on the Supreme Court decision and what you took away from that interview? ALAN DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER: Well I think the most important thing, if he wants to unite the country and broaden his own base is to pick a true conservative Libertarian, one who emphasizes individual liberty over the power of the state. One who believes in judicial restraint, who recognizes precedent. He shouldn't be focusing on particular cases like Roe versus Wade, he should be thinking about the future. We don't know what will come before the Supreme Court 10, 20 years from now. When you think about some of the past horrible cases, Korematsu where we detained 110,000 Japanese Americans. It was the liberals who supported that and the conservatives who dissented, or when they allowed sterilization of mentally challenged people. It was the liberals who supported that and one lone, conservative, catholic justice who said liberty doesn't permit that. So if he can pick a genuine libertarian rather than somebody who's oriented towards state power, it will contribute enormously to the country and enormously to bringing the people together (ph). BARTIROMO: So his answer on Roe v. Wade was what, in your view? DERSHOWITZ: Well, remember the question, Roe v. Wade there were three possibilities. One, Roe versus Wade was wrong then, it's wrong now, I'm going to overrule it. Second, Roe versus Wade was wrong then, but it's been on the books for 45 years. I'm not going to overrule it. The third most extreme position is I believe in a constitutional right to life and therefore not only do I overrule Roe versus Wade, but I prevent the states from allowing abortion because allowing abortion denies the right of the fetus to life. I don't believe he'll nominate somebody who will -- who accepts that third position, because that would hurt America and divide it greatly. I think he should pick somebody who respects precedent and will not overrule Roe versus Wade. BARTIROMO: Senator D'Amato, he said he's going to have this nomination in place by July 9th. Do you think, knowing the Senate as you do, this actually can be confirmed before the midterm elections? What's you take on this (ph)? AL D'AMATO, FORMER SENATOR, R-N.Y.: I believe it will be, I really do, because I think not withstanding that there are two senators on the Republican side who Roe v. Wade is a big matter and -- and therefore I think the president already kind of has taken that off the table. But there are several Democrats who are in tough races in -- in states that the president carried overwhelmingly who will undoubtedly support the nominee, if the nominee meets the criteria that the president talks about. And I think he's right, a conservative, I -- agree with Alan. You want a -- a -- someone who believes in the constitution, who's a libertarian, and I honestly believe it will be done before the recess -- yes. BARTIROMO: The midterm election. Ed Rollins, this is going to end up being one of the most consequential presidents of our time. ED ROLLINS, POLITICAL ADVISER: No question about that. BARTIROMO: If not the most consequential with all of these judges on the federal level as well as -- (CROSS TALK) ROLLINS: Once you get rid of all the brush underneath his feet, all the little minor controversies and really look at -- focus on what he's done, he's done an extraordinary amount in 18 months, and I worked for an extraordinary president, Ronald Reagan. If he appoints, and he's got a list of people to appoint that are superb, we have gone through this test before. My sense is -- I'm not on the selection panel, but I would -- I would recommend a conservative -- a real conservative, originalist woman. Sandra Day O'Conner was the first woman that Reagan appointed, by the end, she was the swing vote, voted most correctly most times. But a real conservative who can drive that court and help that court basically set precedent for the future I think would be a great, great appointment. BARTIROMO: All of these issues that we've talked about, what -- what's your reaction to the interview, because all of this is going to be front and center in November and then again in 2020. ROLLINS: This -- this is a campaign of -- of this cycle, and -- and we're down to about 25 seats in the House that are -- that are swing seats, Democrats have to win two thirds of those to take the majority. He's going to have to talk about trade, he's going to have to talk about this appointment which is going to basically dominate everything between now and then, and I think the reality is that it's something he feels very positive about and I think he does it very, very well. BARTIROMO: And for a little while there, Senator, immigration -- people were worried about their families, getting separated from their children. But he did move quickly on that. D'AMATO: That -- look, that was a mistake he made in terms of -- BARTIROMO: The agencies weren't ready. D'AMATO: Yes. BARTIROMO: -- for the zero tolerance policy. D'AMATO: Yes. However, he's right on immigration. And when you talk about doing away with ICE -- Ed and I were talking earlier in the program. The numbers are incredible. And by the way, ICE doesn't make the policy. It's -- you're going to blame the Internal Revenue Service for policy and laws that they implement? BARTIROMO: Right. Even Kirsten Gillibrand said let's abolish ICE> D'AMATO: Well, it's ridiculous. I mean, 5,000 criminals from New York in the past year have been deported. And we're talking about 2,000 murderers have -- have been deported. I mean -- (CROSSTALK) D'AMATO: -- talking about people who just break traffic -- (CROSSTALK) (BARTIROMO): And I think that's where the American people are as well, the sentiment that you're raising. Let's take a short break. More with our panel coming up. Stay with us. Right now. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back and we are back with our panel. One last word on this ICE story that the Democrats are trying to push to get ICE abolished. You've got a poll that you want to mention. ROLLINS: New poll. It's Mark Penn, who was Hillary Clinton's pollster and chief strategist came out with today. And the question is you want to abolish ICE and the answer is overwhelmingly 69 percent say no, 59 percent of Democrats say no and 73 percent of independents say no. And 70 percent of the public want a stricter border control (ph). BARTIROMO: How do you think they're going to do in the midterms? DERSHOWITZ: You know, the Democrats (ph) -- (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead, Alan. Alan, go ahead. DERSHOWITZ: The Democrats are destroying themselves on this issue. I'm a Democrat. By electing a radical, socialist, virulently anti-Israel woman to Congress recently in Queens and the Bronx, that to me shows the dangerous direction of the Democratic party. They will just continue to lose and lose and lose if they move to the extreme left and try to capture the extreme, extreme left at the expense of the middle. We lost this election because we lost the middle -- BARTIROMO: Right. DERSHOWITZ: And the Democrats are (ph) responding by nominating people who moving the party even more and more to the left. BARTIROMO: Right. Most people want law and order. ROLLINS: And -- and Senator Gillibrand here in New York and Mayor DeBlasio here in New York have basically come out in supporting this about abolish ICE. And I promise you if they do that, they'll give us the best issue to win (ph). BARTIROMO: Incredible. D'AMATO: Well, let me say this to you. BARTIROMO: Yes. D'AMATO: It can save -- the Democrats being for ICE, pushing it to where they are -- BARTIROMO: Yes. D'AMATO: -- can absolutely save the Republicans in the House this year and strengthen the Republicans in the Senate. They'll pick up seats. BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears. Alan, let me ask you your thoughts on what he said about these documents that Congress wants. We saw Rod Rosenstein testify last night -- last week. Lot of people are now wondering -- he was a witness. Is he conflicted? Should he be recusing himself on these issues? DERSHOWITZ: Look, I taught legal ethics at Harvard for over 25 years. This is the easiest question in the world. Of course he should be recused. He's the main witness on the firing of Comey. There's now a dispute. He says to the -- the New York Times reports that he's now saying he was used by the president. That will be a big issue. These disclosure of documents -- some of these documents may involve him as a witness. How can he be the one deciding which documents get revealed and which don't get revealed? BARTIROMO: Yes. DERSHOWITZ: He should have been out of this case before it ever started. He should have recused himself. BARTIROMO: Yes. DERSHOWITZ: And if I were the president's lawyers, I'd be moving in court and in front of ethics groups to have him removed for a conflict of interest. BARTIROMO: All right. DERSHOWITZ: He is conflicted. BARTIROMO: We -- we -- we will leave it there. Gentlemen, it's great to have you on the program this morning. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. Great interview with the president. BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. We appreciate it very much. We are going to analyze Iran and North Korea tomorrow morning on Fox Business Network. Mornings with Maria. Join me 6:00 to 9:00 am Eastern. Stay with Fox News right now. \"MediaBuzz\" coming up right after a short break. Have a great weekend, everybody. Thanks for being here.

            "article_content": "Republicans hoping for a 2016 repeat on the heels of the Kavanaugh confirmation. There are two big reasons Republicans need to vote on November 6. First, President Trump has just begun to reverse eight years of Obama\u2019s liberal folly. We need to keep the Trump Train rolling. Second, Democrats must not be rewarded for their bad behavior. The Trump White House has accomplished a great deal over the past 22 months. Tax reform has made American businesses more competitive with their rivals overseas and made the U.S. a more attractive place to invest. The GOP tax bill also lowered taxes for middle-class Americans, allowing them to keep a bigger share of their hard-earned dollars. The White House has also rolled back hundreds of costly regulations, freeing up funds for growth and innovation. Among the Obama-era rules that have been eliminated is the Clean Power Act, which threatened higher energy prices for all Americans and a vast reordering of our highly efficient power industries. Others, like those impacting federal lands, simply gave authority back to the people and their elected officials, and rightly so. AS MIDTERM ELECTIONS APPROACH, REPUBLICANS MUST DO THIS Most importantly, the White House has appointed two Supreme Court judges, 29 circuit court judges and 53 district court judges. These additions are a welcome down payment on rebalancing our liberal judiciary. None of these things could have happened without the support of Congress. Legislators have played a critical role in confirming conservative judges, reversing some Obama-era rules and rewriting our tax code. If Democrats take control of the House or, heaven forbid, both the House and the Senate, the Trump Train will go off the rails. The country cannot afford to let that happen; there is still too much to do. For instance, health care. The first year of the Trump presidency was clouded by the failure of Republicans in Congress to repeal and replace ObamaCare, but they did manage to abolish the individual mandate, arguably the least popular aspect of the bill.\u00a0 Much more remains to be done. Democrats have lied about the GOP tax cuts, lied about Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s record, lied about health care, lied about Trump\u2019s connections to Russia and so much more. Protecting ObamaCare is the Democrats\u2019 signature issue in this election cycle, as they combat voters giving Republicans credit for the booming economy. They have accused the GOP of wanting to eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions and gut Medicaid. Republicans have given them this opening. The GOP needs to respond by talking up the \u201cassociation health plans\u201d that became available starting September 1 and also the cheaper short-term plans now being offered. The first program allows small businesses and self-employed people the opportunity to band together to buy insurance, taking advantage of the cost savings available to larger groups. The plans can be sold across state lines, which will further reduce costs. The second program saves people money by sensibly shrinking the number of ObamaCare mandates; healthy males, for instance, do not need maternity or drug-treatment benefits. We need more innovation of this sort, and more inclusion of the private sector. \u00a0Even though ObamaCare rates will rise only an estimated 3.3 percent next year, for many Americans the coverage is still too expensive. Next up is further deregulation. President Obama enacted 3,853 (or a record 97,000 pages) of rules in his 8 years at bat. When he left office, there were an additional 2,391 regulations pending. Because Obama did not have a compliant Congress, he ruled by fiat; in 2016 alone there were 18 rules issued for every law that was passed. Anyone who has tried to start a new business or build a building knows the toll that red tape can take; many think the virus-like regulatory creep is one reason why entrepreneurship in the U.S. has dropped off. We cannot afford to let that happen. And, there are more judgeships to fill. Senate Majority Leader McConnell has rightly made these appointments a priority, as legislating from the bench has ballooned. While tax reform, regulatory relief and sending more conservatives to serve on federal courts topped Trump\u2019s to-do list, they are not the only challenges facing this country.\u00a0 As hundreds of Hondurans march towards the U.S. southern border, we are reminded that our immigrations laws are a mess. That U.S. officials cannot prevent people from streaming into our country is appalling. \u00a0It is equally appalling that most will disappear from view, failing to show up for court hearings, relegated to the shadows and encouraged by liberal \u201csanctuary\u201d policies that make a mockery of the rule of law. The battle over immigration policy has nothing to do with tolerance or generosity. The United States will always be, as it has been, a beacon of hope for peoples oppressed around the world, who apply for and enter the country legally. But our porous borders must be protected and our laws obeyed. We also need to change our admission policies, giving priority to those highly qualified individuals who can make a meaningful contribution to our country. We need Congress, led by Republicans, to finally confront this issue.\u00a0 In their push for Hispanic votes, Democrats have adopted absurd positions on this topic, effectively conflating legal and illegal immigration. They no longer deserve a seat at the table. Immigration and health care are two big domestic challenges facing the country that demand real fixes, not political pandering. There are others, like mending our failing public education system, that Republicans alone can address. There are also numerous international challenges, including China\u2019s egregious theft of intellectual property, North Korea\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons and Iran\u2019s regional misbehavior. The White House is standing up to these adversaries, with the backing of Congress. Nothing could be more damaging to our standing in the world than to have Trump\u2019s more muscular approach undermined by a Democratic Congress. Republicans need to vote in the midterms to signal their support for all these initiatives. They also need to signal their disgust with the obstruction and deceit of Democrats who have lied about the GOP tax cuts, lied about Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s record, lied about health care, lied about Trump\u2019s connections to Russia and so much more. While Democrats continue to march and scream and threaten, all because they cannot and will not accept the outcome of the 2016 election, Republicans must show they are the adults in the room, ready to move the nation forward. Ready to advance the Trump Train, which is just gaining steam. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK",

            "article_content": "A silhouette of a happy family of four people, mother, father, baby, and child, and their dog in front of a sunsetting sky, with room for copy space or text (christingasner) Americans and Europeans are abandoning parenthood at an alarming rate, profoundly changing the nature of our societies, our politics and our cultures. Last year, women in the U.S. had children at the lowest rate ever recorded. There were just 60.2 births for every 1,000 girls and women ages 15 to 44 in our country. As a result, there were fewer births in America last year \u2013 3.85 million babies \u2013 than at any time since 1987. This was a 2 percent drop from 2016. In addition, those having the most children are least able to pay for their upbringing. American women became mothers last year at rates that were inversely proportional to family income. The birth rate was almost 50 percent higher for those with less than $10,000 in family income than for those with family incomes of $200,000 or more. There are many wonderful mothers in impoverished families. And a good income is no guarantee of good parenting. But in general, children being raised in very low-income families will struggle, while children being raised in middle- and upper-income families will do better without relying on taxpayers to finance their upbringing. The lack of commitment of middle-class and wealthy Americans to having and parenting their own children goes hand in hand with our elite\u2019s casual approach to other issues \u2013 in particular, mass immigration. The notion that we can simply import foreigners to make up for the child-rearing job we have refused to do ourselves completely ignores the cultural, civic and economic impacts of immigration \u2013 as well as the impacts to ourselves when we bring in foreign adults as a substitute for raising our own children. While I would be the last person to insist that large families like ours be the American model, an America where only the poorest have large families and most people choose to have small families \u2013 or no children at all \u2013 is not economically or culturally sustainable. While selective immigration in conjunction with a naturally growing population and economy can be a healthy phenomenon, using immigration as a substitute for having enough of our own children leads us down an \u00a0easy and comfortable but ultimately perilous route without precedent in American history. People having fewer or no children at all may seem at first blush to be simply making a personal choice, of consequence only to themselves. However, this decision is actually one with profound political implications. No matter where on Earth a person lives, parenthood is a lifelong investment. The willingness to make that investment is a critical indicator and determinant of a person\u2019s political viewpoint. In the U.S., parents with more children are embracing a more traditional lifestyle and also are more likely to vote Republican. In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump won all 10 of the states with the highest fertility rates \u2013 as well as 16 of 17 states with the highest fertility rates. And the bottom 10 states in fertility were all carried by Hillary Clinton. The most family-friendly element of the tax cuts Congress approved and President Trump signed into law was increasing the child tax credit from $2,000 from $1,000 (where it had been stuck since 2003) and substantially raising the phase-out threshold from $110,000 in family income to $400,000. It\u2019s a change that puts real money in the pockets of taxpaying American families. Still, even under the new tax regime, the fertility of women of childbearing age in households paying no federal income taxes is almost 25 percent higher than the fertility of those paying income taxes. To say this demographic trend is incompatible with the long-term viability of a welfare state is understating matters considerably. But for all the challenges we face in the U.S., the problem is far worse in Europe, where the current attitude was summarized in a recent report by Population Europe titled \u00a0\u201cNo Kids, No Problem!\u201d European women of child-bearing age had an average of 1.56 children each over their lifetimes \u2013 far fewer than the 2.1 necessary to even keep their population stable. The comparable figure in the U.S. is 1.76 children per woman. And both the numbers in the U.S. and in Europe would be far worse were it not for higher immigrant fertility. In Europe, it\u2019s not just that they are having fewer children \u2013 more and more people aren\u2019t having any children at all. The Europeans who are declining to become parents are only following the example of their leaders. Of the six founding members of the European Union (Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) today only one of them (Belgium) is led by someone who has had children. Britain and the European Commission are also headed by childless leaders. Amazingly, these eight core leaders of modern Europe have a total of only two children among them. Contrast this demographic collapse to the situation of the leaders of this same group of countries in 1951, when they founded what became the European Union. At that time, the eight leaders of these countries had 32 children. If you wanted to summarize the forthcoming demographic and cultural collapse of Europe in one statistic, the decline in children among Europe\u2019s core leaders from 32 to 2 in a little more than a generation would be an ideal place to start. At an individual level, each of today\u2019s European leaders may have had compelling or even tragic reasons for not becoming a parent \u2013 perhaps at great personal sorrow. Yet while we cannot judge any one particular situation, we can almost certainly say that such a dramatic pattern is not coincidental. Nor is it harmless. In both Europe and the U.S., the decline in motherhood \u2013 and the increased decline in the number of men accepting the responsibilities of fatherhood (40 percent of births in the U.S and Europe \u00a0occur out of wedlock) are indicative of a materialistic, pleasure-seeking, live-for-today ethos. This attitude minimizes or denies the obligations we have toward future generations. It is a sign of our crisis of parenthood that to even raise such issues publicly is uncomfortable. Certainly, maximum childbearing is not an outcome we seek \u2013 countries with the world\u2019s highest fertility rates are mired in poverty and face many challenges. But with so many of the West\u2019s citizens and leaders abandoning parenthood and responsibility, some response is needed. I say all this not as an academic observer but as the father of five young children, with a wife who works part-time at night. We have taken no paid maternity or paternity leaves and utilized only very limited outside child care. So I know from my personal experience every day the sort of social, emotional and financial sacrifices that parenting requires. While I would be the last person to insist that large families like ours be the American model, an America where only the poorest have large families and most people choose to have small families \u2013 or no children at all \u2013 is not economically or culturally sustainable. In his book, \u201cThe Disappearance of Childhood,\u201d the late cultural critic Neil Postman wrote: \"Children are the living messages we send to a time we will not see.\u201d We need to keep sending those messages, not just because it is our responsibility or because of the profound love and joy children bring into our lives, but because we realize that a society that abandons parenthood is a society that forfeits its future.",

            "article_content": "New reports project Montana Senator Jon Tester to win his reelection bid against Republican challenger Matt Rosendale. Montana Sen. Jon Tester is projected to win his reelection bid in a tight race against Republican challenger Matt Rosendale, the Associated Press reported. With 94\u00a0percent of precincts reporting, Tester leads Rosendale 49 percent to 48\u00a0percent. Tester, a Democrat who has\u00a0represented Montana in the Senate since 2007, faced a tough reelection in a state where President Trump enjoys broad support. During the campaign season Trump made an unprecedented four trips to Montana to stump for Rosendale. FULL MIDTERM RESULTS \"I would love to tell you this country is on the cusp of coming together, but it isn't,\" Tester said Wednesday in a speech to supporters. \"But I can tell you that we need to work together in this country. We need to hold people accountable for their actions, and that will be done. And we need to move forward in a way that we have the strongest middle class ever.\" During the campaign, Tester steered clear of inviting prominent Democrats to stump for him \u2013 instead bringing in actor Jeff Bridges and the rock band Pearl Jam as supporters \u2013 and attempted to keep the focus on Montana politics. TRUMP SLAMS CNN'S ACOSTA FOR PRESS CONFERENCE PERFORMANCE: 'YOU ARE A RUDE, TERRIBLE PERSON' He labeled Rosendale, a Maryland transplant who moved to the state in 2003, as an \u201cEast Coast developer\u201d funded by groups outside the state and as somebody who did not understand issues important to Montanans. \u201cThis is a race between myself and Matt Rosendale, make no mistake about it. Matt Rosendale doesn\u2019t know what the hell is going on in Montana. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t talk about the issues he believes in, because he doesn\u2019t know them,\u201d\u00a0Tester\u00a0told The Hill in an interview last week. Tester became a particular target for Trump after the senator in April\u00a0derailed the president's first-choice for Veterans Affairs secretary, Ronny Jackson, with allegations of drunken behavior, overprescribing prescription drugs and fostering a hostile work environment. Jackson denied the allegations, which have been referred to the Pentagon's Inspector General for investigation. Tester is the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee. Tester insisted that Montana voters across the political spectrum would support him after examining his record.",

            "article_content": "President Trump discusses Senator Ted Cruz as he departs the White House for a MAGA rally in Houston, Texas. President Trump, who is set to hold a rally for his onetime bitter rival, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, in Houston Monday evening,\u00a0also made clear that the two have ended their feud \u2015 and the president has a few new nicknames for the senator. Asked about recent comments by Cruz\u2019s rival, Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, that Trump had been accurate when he called Cruz \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d the president shot back immediately. \u201cI think Beto O\u2019Rourke is highly overrated,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u201cWhen I heard about him, I thought he must be something special. He\u2019s not.\u201d He continued: \u201cHe\u2019s not Lyin\u2019 Ted anymore. He\u2019s \u2018Beautiful Ted.\u2019\u201d Then, as reporters quizzically repeated that moniker, Trump added quickly:\u00a0\u201dI call him 'Texas Ted.' ... He\u2019s a very smart guy. He loves the people of Texas.\u201d Asked whether he regretted suggesting that Cruz\u2019s father had helped assassinate\u00a0President John F. Kennedy, Trump replied: \u201cI don\u2019t regret anything, honestly. It all worked out, very nicely.\u201d Trump promised he would come to Texas after the Senate race grew closer than expected, with O\u2019Rourke out-fundraising Cruz and drawing large and enthusiastic crowds around the state. No Democrat has won a statewide race in Texas since 1994, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign raised $38.1 million in the third quarter \u2015 tripling the amount Cruz collected. Closing in on Election Day, Trump tweeted Monday morning: \u201cBig Night In Texas!!!!\u201d In recent weeks, Trump has attacked O\u2019Rourke on Twitter as a \u201ctotal lightweight\u201d and a \u201cflake,\u201d while stressing that Cruz \u201chas long had my Strong Endorsement.\u201d Cruz, who is leading O\u2019Rourke in the polls, said over the summer that he would welcome Trump\u2019s support, though he has brushed off any suggestion he\u2019d need Trump to win. While Trump will promote Cruz and other Texas Republicans, Texas also will provide a backdrop for the president\u2019s invigorated immigration rhetoric. The \u201camoral bully\u201d is ready to campaign for the \u201cdishonest politician\u201d as President Donald Trump holds a Houston rally for Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday. (AP, File) Although political relationships tend to be fluid, Trump\u2019s appearance for Cruz is notable, given that the two were bitter enemies during the 2016 primaries. After Trump insulted Cruz\u2019s wife and father, and Cruz refused to endorse Trump at the Republican convention, it was far from clear that the two would ever put it all behind them. EX-CLINTON ADVISER SAYS IT'S OK TO CONFRONT REPUBLICANS IN PUBLIC But, they started rebuilding in the closing days of the campaign and have worked together since Trump took the White House. \u201cI think they\u2019re neutral,\u201d said former Cruz campaign aide Rick Tyler. \u201cI think, like a lot of political relationships, they\u2019re often transactional.\u201d During the 2016 Republican primary, Trump assailed Cruz as a liar and \u201cdishonest politician,\u201d insulted his wife\u2019s appearance and promoted unsubstantiated claims that Cruz\u2019s father had links to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. TRUMP COMMITS TO PLAN FOR MIDDLE-INCOME TAX CUT AFTER ELECTION DAY Cruz gave back as good as he got. He savaged Trump as a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d an \u201camoral bully\u201d and a \u201csniveling coward.\u201d After Cruz lost the primary, he gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in which he did not endorse Trump and instead called on Republicans to \u201cvote your conscience,\u201d drawing boos from the crowd. But he announced his support about a month before Election Day \u2014 and won points in Trump\u2019s camp for not withdrawing after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was released in which Trump bragged about groping women. Since Trump took office, Cruz and his wife have dined at the White House, and Cruz has said his office is in regular touch with the White House on policy. Still, in an interview aired over the weekend on ABC News, he dodged a question on whether the two were friends or foes. \u201cHe\u2019s the president,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI work with the president in delivering on our promises.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(Reuters) Phoenix Mayor\u00a0Greg Stanton, an anti-Trump Democrat who has held the post in Arizona's capital city for more than six years, stepped down Tuesday to focus on a run for Congress. Stanton first announced in October that he intended to run for the U.S. House seat currently occupied by departing Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who is seeking the U.S. Senate seat of retiring Republican Jeff Flake. Under Arizona's \"resign to run\" law, Stanton had to resign from the mayorship by the end of May in order to maintain his federal candidacy. Wednesday is the filing deadline for the race in Arizona's 9th Congressional District, which is centered in Tempe and includes parts of nearby communities, including Phoenix. The primaries are scheduled for Aug. 28, and the general election will be Nov. 6. Stanton is expected to face at least two other Democrats, while as many as five Republicans are expected to run. Independent candidates and those representing smaller parties also will run. Democrat Stanton has long criticized President Donald Trump, and has cited his opposition to Republican leadership in Washington as one of the key reasons for his run. PHOENIX MAYOR NOT HAPPY ABOUT TRUMP RALLY \"Arizonans deserve better than what we're getting from Washington, and there has never been a more consequential time in the fight to protect the middle class,\" Stanton said in October. \"In Congress, I'll continue to do what we've done in Phoenix --deliver real results that improve people's lives.\" In August, Stanton criticized Trump for announcing a rally in Phoenix just a day after the president blamed \"both sides\" for weekend violence in Charlottesville, Va., between white supremacists and counter-demonstrators. \"I am disappointed that President Trump has chosen to hold a campaign rally as our nation is still healing from the tragic events in Charlottesville,\" Stanton said in a statement at the time. \"It is my hope that more sound judgment prevails and that he delays his visit.\" Thelda Williams, who was the vice mayor, is now serving as Phoenix's mayor. She is expected to retain the post after a City Council vote in June, and would be up for election in November.",

(Reuters) Hillary Clinton agreed Wednesday that being a capitalist likely damaged her 2016 campaign because nearly half of Democrats say they are socialists. \"Probably,\" Clinton said at the Shared Values Leadership Summit in New York City, after being asked whether support for capitalism hurt her at the polls. \"It's hard to know, but if you're in the Iowa caucuses and 41 percent of Democrats are socialists, or self-described socialists, and I'm asked, \u2018Are you a capitalist?' And I say, \u2018Yes, but with appropriate regulation and appropriate accountability,' you know, that probably gets lost in the \u2018Oh my gosh, she's a capitalist.'\" Clinton won the Iowa caucus by a mere half-point. The former U.S. secretary of state was challenged from the left during the Democratic primaries by self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont who repeatedly criticized her for being bankrolled by Wall Street and not going after capitalism and with the same hostility as the Democratic grassroots hoped for. During the first Democratic debate in 2015, Sanders refused to identify himself as a capitalist. \u201cDo I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little?\u201d he asked. \u201cBy which Wall Street greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No I don\u2019t.\u201d Clinton, meanwhile, offered a defense of capitalism, saying: \u201cWhen I think about capitalism, I think about all the businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families \u2026 We would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history.\u201d Following a short hiatus from promoting her election post-mortem book \"What Happened,\" Clinton returned to political activities Monday, just six months before the midterm elections. The former candidate attended a gathering of nearly a dozen progressive groups supported by Onward Together, the post-election political organization she founded that's aimed at \u201cadvancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to see us go backwards,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut organized interests fueled by ideology and huge amounts of money are trying to take us backwards.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining me. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The Putin-Trump summit coming days after the Justice Department indicts 12 Russians for meddling in the 2016 election. I will be getting reaction this morning from the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Devin Nunes is here. Plus, the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee calling for the president to meet face to face with the president of China over an escalating trade dispute. Congressman Kevin Brady will join me. And good signs for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. One Red state Democrat reportedly telling Minority Leader Schumer to -- quote -- \"Kiss my\" you-know-what. One of the moments that you have to see. One of the most important senators in ensuring Kavanaugh's confirmation is with me today. Senator Orrin Hatch is here, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now. All of that coming up. But, first, one of the most contentious hearings on Capitol Hill that we have seen in quite some time. FBI agent Peter Strzok faced off against House Republicans last week. Then, the other person at the center of the controversy, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, appearing behind closed doors Friday and then again. Day two of her testimony happens tomorrow, on Monday. My next guest was one of the select group of lawmakers to question them both. And he had the heated exchange with Strzok, who claims his personal opinions about the president had no impact on his professional conduct. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, R-TEXAS: Of the approximately 50 000 text messages that I have seen with your personal beliefs, like F. Trump, stop Trump, impeach Trump, go ahead and confirm on the record that none of that occurred on an official FBI device or on official FBI time. Go ahead and do that. PETER STRZOK, FBI AGENT: Sir, no, they did. Many of them did occur. RATCLIFFE: Oh, they did. OK, so. (CROSSTALK) RATCLIFFE: So, really -- no, I will give you a chance at the end. So, what you really meant to say was that, when you said you never crossed that bright, inviolable line, what you meant to say was, except for 50 000 times. I'm sure there are 13,000 FBI agents out there that are beaming with pride at how clearly you have drawn that line. Do you see why that might call into question everything you have touched on all of those investigations? (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: And that, of course, was Congressman John Ratcliffe. He is a member of the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees. He's also a former federal prosecutor himself. Congressman, it is good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. RATCLIFFE: You bet. Thanks, Maria. BARTIROMO: And nice work there getting to the heart of the issue in terms of him using his personal devices to trash the president. So, at this point, you have interviewed Peter Strzok in that very contentious and public hearing. You have spoken with Lisa Page on Friday. And you will do that again tomorrow for day two of her testimony. What have we learned? RATCLIFFE: Well, it was a bit of a circus atmosphere, as you saw Maria, on Wednesday. And it's easy to lose the forest for the trees. But the -- but the most important takeaway, I think, is for people to remember that, if the special counsel ever decides to bring any Russia collusion-related charges against anyone associated with the Trump campaign, to include Donald Trump, then Peter Strzok has to be a star witness. He has to be a star witness because he was in charge of the Russian medication. He started it. He ran it for the first year. He collected all of the evidence. So, his credibility is of primary importance. And that's why, if you were listening at the hearing, it may have seemed like there were two different Peter Strzoks in the room. The Democrats talked about a Peter Strzok who they characterized as a patriot and a hero and someone deserving of a Purple Heart. The Peter Strzok that I questioned is a disgraced FBI agent who has been demoted by the FBI, is being investigated by the FBI for misconduct for those types of text messages that really call into question how much he hated Donald Trump at the same time that he was investigating Donald Trump. So, look, as a former federal prosecutor, the government can't walk into a courtroom with Peter Strzok as a star witness. Within 10 minutes of seeing these texts, the jurors would have reasonable doubt in their minds. So that's -- the credibility of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page will be of primary importance to ultimately what people think of the special counsel's findings. BARTIROMO: So, you think this hearing and just his performance -- there was arrogance, there was pushback, obstructing, not -- not answering some questions -- you think that poke holes in his credibility as a star witness for the special prosecutor? RATCLIFFE: Well, I certainly didn't find him credible. And I think most American people would say, if I'm the subject of an investigation, would I want this guy investigating me at the same time he is sending 50 000 text messages, many of which talk about how much he hates me? BARTIROMO: Yes. RATCLIFFE: Remember, one of -- one of the text messages, Maria, less than a week after he was put in charge of the Russia investigation, he said he was going to protect the country from the menace of Donald Trump, that he was going to stop Trump from being president. He talked about an insurance policy. That alone really raises reasonable doubt and real questions about the validity of any evidence that he collected in this investigation, which became the special counsel probe. BARTIROMO: Has there been a difference in the answers that he gave vs. what Lisa Page told you yesterday and what she might tell you tomorrow? RATCLIFFE: So, I can't get into the content of the testimony from Lisa Page yet. What I can tell you is that Congressman Gowdy and I had two hours to question her on Friday. I can tell you that there are significant differences in her testimony. BARTIROMO: Yes. RATCLIFFE: From agent Strzok as it relates to these text messages, what she thought some of them meant. And she gave us new information that he either wouldn't or couldn't that confirmed some of the concerns that we have about these investigations and the people involved in running them. BARTIROMO: Let me ask you specifically. RATCLIFFE: We will continue. BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead. RATCLIFFE: And we will continue her deposition on Monday. And then, after that, we will have additional witnesses that come in. So, we're going to keep the pressure on, Maria. BARTIROMO: Give me your reaction to the 12 additional indictments that we saw this weekend by Rod Rosenstein. Obviously, they're indicting these 12 Russians for meddling in the 2016 election. RATCLIFFE: Well, so, if you're keeping track of the numbers, I think that makes 25 or 26 Russians indicted for meddling in our election, but it's zero Russians indicted for colluding with Americans. And it's zero Americans indicted for colluding with Russians. So, all of this goes to prove what many of us that have seen every classified document have been saying, which is that there is no evidence of collusion. But as a former U.S. attorney and as a former terrorism prosecutor and national security lawyer, I got to tell you, Maria, it's a really curious way about going about an investigation if you're serious. Typically, when you have got defendants in foreign jurisdictions, you don't hold a public press conference and announce it if you ever have any intention of prosecuting them. The indictments should have remained sealed until you could lure those defendants to a jurisdiction from which they could be extradited, arrested, and then unseal the indictments. So it really seems like, from my perspective, this is more about the special counsel trying to justify the work that they're doing and their existence, rather than really trying to seriously prosecute folks that were trying to meddle in our elections. BARTIROMO: Because, at the end of the day, we don't have jurisdiction over them, and they -- they're not going to be prosecuted. We can't. RATCLIFFE: Well, that's exactly right, Maria. And the other problem with this is, these types of cases, U.S. attorneys can handle them. Lawyers from the Criminal Division, National Security Division at main Justice can handle these cases. We don't need a special counsel. Remember, the special counsel's mandate is links and coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. BARTIROMO: Right. RATCLIFFE: And there's not a word of that in any of these indictments. BARTIROMO: Interesting. Really, really fascinating. I want to take a short break. But I have got to ask you about the Democrats and how they are trying to stop President Trump from meeting with Putin on Monday. So, we will take a short break. When we come back, we will talk Helsinki with Congressman John Ratcliffe. Stay with us, Congressman. Be sure to catch my program on FOX Business Network tomorrow morning. And we begin it an hour earlier, 5:00 a.m. Eastern. We will be navigating President Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. We're starting at 5:00 a.m., 5:00 to 9:00 a.m. Join us for a four-hour marathon program live here. Join me tomorrow on the Fox Business Network. Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures. Let us know what you would like to hear from Congressman Ratcliffe. We will be back with him in two minutes' time. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. And I'm back now with Congressman John Ratcliffe. We're talking about these new indictments from the Justice Department targeting 12 Russian intelligence officials. And now, Congressman, many on the left are demanding that President Trump not meet with Vladimir Putin tomorrow in Helsinki, Chuck Schumer putting out a tweet basically saying, \"Cancel the Putin meeting now.\" Your reaction? RATCLIFFE: Well, first thing, someone needs to remind Senator Schumer that the party in the minority doesn't get to set and make foreign policy decisions. As the former President Obama used to say often, elections have consequences. But even setting that aside, the real reason that Senator Schumer and other Democrats don't want Donald Trump to sit down with Vladimir Putin tomorrow is the same reason they didn't want Donald Trump to sit down with Kim Jong- un last month. They're afraid he will succeed. With respect to North Korea, I think everyone has to concede that there is at least the real prospect of success there, of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula, that Republicans and Democrats had failed to achieve for the last two-and-a-half decades. So, now, I think the Democrats are deathly afraid of Donald Trump sitting down with Vladimir Putin and kicking holes in all of the things that they have been saying about him being a puppet of Putin and the Kremlin. And I certainly don't think they want a comparison between how Donald Trump is going to deal with Putin vs. how President Obama did. Remember, President Obama's feckless foreign policy as it related to Putin was a hiding under the covers while Russia took Crimea policy. It was a policy where he had his national security adviser, Susan Rice, tell our cyber-officials to stand down, rather than stand up, when we found out the Russians were meddling with our election. If you think that's how Donald Trump's going to approach Vladimir Putin, as we say here in East Texas, hide and watch. I think the president's going to have a very different message for Vladimir Putin tomorrow. BARTIROMO: So what will his message be? And do you think Crimea is part of the conversation? RATCLIFFE: I very much expect Crimea to be part of the conversation. But I also expect part of the conversation to be President Trump relating to Vladimir Putin in maybe not-so-subtle terms that we have the ability to cripple the Russian economy, to bring it to its knees, to sell natural gas to the Europeans a lot -- for a lot less than the Russians are. And if you think that President Trump's last stop at NATO and the discussions there about a German pipeline to bring that natural gas from Russia was some sort of a coincidence, I think you would be mistaken. BARTIROMO: Yes. Before we go, let me ask you. Based on what you saw on Friday in that hearing with Peter Strzok, do you think we will see accountability? Characterize what you saw in that room on Friday. How was he? RATCLIFFE: Well, again, I didn't find him to be a credible or believable witness. And he is the star witness in Bob Mueller's investigation if he ever brings Russian collusion charges. And, again, already, there are serious conflicts between his testimony and that of Lisa Page. So, from the accountability standpoint, I think the most important thing for many of us is, we don't see any evidence of Russian collusion, yet this investigation by the special counsel, what he's supposed to be doing, is proceeding. And there doesn't seem to be any evidence from that. And these recent indictments don't have anything to do with that. So, to quote my good friend Trey Gowdy, it does seem like special counsel needs to finish the hell up. BARTIROMO: Yes. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: Well, there are reports that he's considering that. We will be watching that. Congressman, it is good to see you, this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. RATCLIFFE: Thanks, Maria. BARTIROMO: We will see soon, Congressman John Ratcliffe. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is here next, right on set. Back in a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Special counsel Robert Mueller indicting 12 Russian intelligence officers, accusing them of hacking the DNC and the Clinton campaign in order to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, this as President Trump is gearing up to meet face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow in Helsinki. Joining me right now to talk about all of the above, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. Mr. Chairman, it's always a pleasure to see you. REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIFORNIA: It's great to be here live. I'm not coming from California. (LAUGHTER) BARTIROMO: I know. I'm happy. NUNES: It looks so different. BARTIROMO: It's great that you're on set. So thank you very much. These Russian indictments, we could have known about them earlier this year, when you actually came out with your report back in -- back in March, and then the findings released to the public at the end of April. I have got the report right in front of me. Your reaction to these indictments? NUNES: Well, we knew about this a year-and-a-half ago. Almost everything in the -- in the indictment, we knew about. In -- March 22, we released our findings that you have in front of you right there. Those findings were available March 22. If you remember, the media mocked us. BARTIROMO: Yes, I do remember. NUNES: They made fun of the Republicans. They said it was a whitewash. The Democrats said it was a whitewash. Nearly everything the Democrats said about our report was that it was a whitewash. Then we had to fight with the intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice, so that they wouldn't redact and they would declassify our report. That was finished in April. So, this entire report that you have in front of you, including -- all you had to do was get page four, and you only had to read chapter two, and you would have had nearly everything that's in the indictment. BARTIROMO: That is pretty incredible. Look at all these redactions that you can actually see on the screen. NUNES: And it's page after page of that. (LAUGHTER) NUNES: And, actually, there's more in this report. BARTIROMO: Yes. NUNES: Than what's in the indictment, OK? And this is what -- this is what's very frustrating. So -- so, it's great that they indicted Russians. Yes, they did bad things. I mean, they're always up to bad things. We know that. They have very sophisticated intelligence capabilities in Russia. And they are always -- they are constantly attacking the United States and our allies. However, in the indictment, they leave out some really important people that they also went after. So, the indictment plays like they're only going after the Democrats, when Bob Mueller and all his investigators and his lawyers know for a fact that they also targeted Republicans. Why is that not in the indictment? It makes the indictment look ridiculous. BARTIROMO: OK. So. (CROSSTALK) NUNES: Now, I'm not saying they shouldn't be indicted. I'm just saying that. BARTIROMO: That the Russians were targeting both Democrats and Republicans. NUNES: And Republicans. BARTIROMO: Yes. NUNES: And they know that. It's in our report. So why doesn't the -- why doesn't Department of Justice allow this to be declassified, so the American public can see this? BARTIROMO: The other thing is that these people are never going to see justice, right? I mean, we don't have jurisdiction over these -- these people. They're not going to come to the U.S. And so they really won't actually be held accountable. NUNES: Right. They're intelligence officers, so they're not going to be held accountable. It doesn't mean, though, that we shouldn't call out Russia for attacking our -- conducting cyber-attacks on our system. BARTIROMO: But the timing of this, I mean, they -- they released this right after the Peter Strzok hearing. And your point is, we knew all of this year ago. Why is now the time to make these arrests, and not a year ago, when you actually had the information? NUNES: Well, I have to call into question. You knew about this a year- and-a-half ago. You for sure knew it because you got our report. So you for sure knew it by March and April of this year. And then it looks like all you did, all the Mueller did was validate our report, indict some Russians, and leave out, I think, some very pertinent, relative of -- evidence that the American public should see, which is why we continue to have to fight. This report has been mocked by the media, has been mocked by the Democrats, and still is mostly redacted by the Department of Justice and the intelligence agencies. BARTIROMO: And all of these redactions really underline a common theme. And that has been obstruction on the left. You look at that Peter Strzok trial last -- Peter Strzok hearing, rather, last week. And there was so much obstruction on the Democrats. They were trying to change the subject. They -- they were trying to stop the questioning of what went on during the 2016 election. So, how are you going to get the information, when you see you're in a catch-22 situation? Because every time -- you want to know why the Trump collusion investigation launched in the first place. But when you ask that question of Peter Strzok or anybody else in the FBI, they're going to say, we can't talk about it because it's an active investigation. And it is, by the special counsel. NUNES: Yes. So there's -- so, there's a couple points, I think, that are important. So, we have add before July 31 of 2016, we have asked the Department of Justice for months and months and months -- I have said on your show -- did you run informants? How many informants did you have before the investigation was even open? How much did you pay these informants to run into Trump campaign or officials or associates? Because the Department of Justice is trying to say -- and the FBI -- that they didn't do anything until after July 31. So that's -- we're still waiting on that information. I think that is really important information the American people should know. The second biggest problem we have is that the president of the United States has got to declassify this. Why was -- if the president of the United States would have declassified this -- if you go through page after page after page of this, OK, the Mueller indictment would look ridiculous today, if this was redacted -- if this was unredacted and declassified. BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, you know what? Because there is a big portion of the country that will say, oh, he's trying to get in the middle of an investigation, which is why I asked the president two weeks ago, when I sat down with him in that exclusive interview with President Trump, whether or not he's going to declassify these documents. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Why don't you just direct your subordinates to get those documents over to Congress? Are you going to do it? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The one thing I want to stay uninvolved in, at least for now -- I may get involved. BARTIROMO: OK. TRUMP: But I've been told by so many people, don't get involved. You know, all those people got involved. BARTIROMO: Congress wants those documents. TRUMP: It's not good. And they'll get the documents, and it's getting, and they're getting them. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, there an op-ed in this weekend's Wall Street Journal. And the title is, \"After the Strzok Stone Wall,\" basically saying, we're obviously not going to get to the truth through the legal process. The president has got to declassify. Do you think he will do it? NUNES: Well, I think he has to. And I think this is a great example of it. It's not just about Strzok. It's not just about the FISA. Now you have information in our report here that he should have already declassified. And I think then the American people would have known. I mean, we basically wrote the indictment for Mueller. The House Republicans, without the support of the Democrats, wrote the indictment for the Mueller special counsel, essentially, and information that we have had for over a year. So, now you have Strzok, who's -- who is stonewalling Congress, not answering questions, looks very foolish. You add on to the fact that you still have the FISA that is sitting out there that should be declassified, so the American public can see it, because what is consistent in all of this investigation for a year-and-a-half? House Republicans come out and say something, and then we get attacked by the mainstream media, mocked by the mainstream media and the Democrats. But every time, when the truth eventually comes out, we're proven right. And we will be proven right again if the FISA -- majority of the FISA is declassified, so the American public can make up their mind, were the counterintelligence agencies abused by the Obama administration or were they not? BARTIROMO: Yes. And, at this point, we have got, what, 25 or 26 Russians that have been indicted, the number of Russians colluding with -- with Donald Trump, zero, five Americans indicted, four of them for lying to the FBI, and Manafort for a 20-year-old bank fraud. So there are reports today that the special counsel is looking to wrap this up by the end of the summer. Do you believe that? NUNES: I don't believe it. I mean, they look -- I hope that's the case, but they look way too political to me, because every time it seems like something comes out, Strzok or -- or, before that, we had when the FISA stuff came out, the special counsel always seems to be reactive to try to, I think, create narratives. And maybe that's not the case, but it sure looks like the case. BARTIROMO: So, where does your investigation stand now into the State Department and into really how this launch took place of the Trump-Russia probe? NUNES: We are -- we are waiting on the Department of Justice to give us that information before July 31, which, for week after week after week, they continue not to do it. They did provide a lot of documents that are -- that are aiding us in our investigation. And then we have kicked over 42 names. Strzok and Page are two of those 42 names. BARTIROMO: But, also, Glenn Simpson is on that list. NUNES: Yes. So, there's -- and those, we kicked to the task force from the Oversight Committee. And Mr. Ratcliffe is on this task force. We need these people interviewed on camera as soon as possible. BARTIROMO: Real quick, before you go, let me -- let me ask you in terms of what happens now and whether or not you think we're going to see accountability here. NUNES: I think you only see accountability if there is either a second special counsel that investigates all of this or there is somebody that is outside of the leadership of the Department of Justice who can run a -- a real investigation abuse of power and other issues. BARTIROMO: What should the president ask or speak to Putin about? NUNES: Well, the president has to be tough. Well, number one, I would say, don't hand a reset button over, like Hillary Clinton did. BARTIROMO: Yes, the big. (CROSSTALK) NUNES: That's number one. (LAUGHTER) NUNES: Number two, what he's doing with Europe and NATO is what's needed to be done for a long time, which is, one, pay your fair share. And, two, we cannot allow Eastern Europe to rely on German -- on Russian gas. The Germans are building pipelines, getting Russian gas, feeding the Russian beast, right, while the Germans are only paying 1.3 percent. BARTIROMO: Yes. NUNES: So, I laugh about all these people who are saying that Trump shouldn't meet with Putin. Trump has done more on the highest issues at the most important level, pointing them out to the Europeans and us, and the American people, that you have got to stop buying gas from Russians and you have to beef up defense in Poland, Romania and the Baltics. That's what needs to happen. And only by force, brute force will Putin understand anything. BARTIROMO: And. NUNES: And we should give the president the room to do that. BARTIROMO: And you would imagine that this -- obviously, these indictments are brought up as well. NUNES: Yes, I would guess. But -- but that's -- it's -- it's just ridiculous. BARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman, it's really good to see you this morning. NUNES: Nice to see in person. BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. All right, coming up next: a powerful House Republican urging President Trump to sit down with the president of China over an escalating trade dispute there. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady is with me next. Back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A top House Republican is urging President Trump to sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping, amid fears of an escalating trade war between the two countries. This coming after the Trump administration announced it was looking to impose another round of tariffs on an additional $200 billion work of Chinese imports. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady is the lawmaker calling for that meeting and he joins me right now. Congressman, it's good to see you, Mr. Chairman, thanks very much for joining me. REP. KEVIN BRADY, R-TEXAS: Good morning, Maria, thanks for having me. BARTIROMO: Before I ask you about what you'd like to see between the president of China and -- and -- and President Trump, let me ask you your expectation of these tariffs. How much growth is that going to take out of what we've seen? You know, your tax plan we know had a great benefit to the U.S. economy, and now people are wondering if we are going to see four percent growth. Does the tariffs change that? BRADY: Yes, they could. The good news is our economy's so strong the investment and growth, all this because of the new tax cuts and -- and a new, fair way of regulating out of Washington, you know, it's really masked a lot of that. But there's no question it's going to show up in economy, mainly because you're seeing now whether it's local farmers, local manufacturing, local businesses spending their time not investing in new growth, but figuring out how do they handle these tariffs. And so at some point this year, I think it will show up in the economy, that's what we're trying to avoid. BARTIROMO: Are -- are you more concerned about the tariffs on aluminum on steel or the tariffs against China? BRADY: Yes, so I think all of the above in the sense that -- that both are generating retaliation and creating uncertainty where there wasn't one before. I think there is a way for the president to be able to have the time to allow his Chinese strategy to work. But right now because I think there's no certainty about the -- the direction time table with China, the exclusion process on steel and aluminum is just flat broken, the exemption process for countries isn't working for fairly traded price (ph) because of, I think, some unforced airs (ph) in the administration more pain's being felt by local farmers and businesses than need to be. And that's where we are continuing to work with the administration to take that pain off the U.S. economy and make sure it's targeted to the unfairly traded countries like China. BARTIROMO: Part of -- part of the background in terms of the president instituting these tariffs on -- on Chinese imports is the fact that this president and many of us in America understand that the Chinese have been stealing from us for decades, whether it be through intellectual property theft or the forced transfer of technology when the Chinese acquire companies in Silicon Valley. They force them to show -- show their innovation and their technology, stealing our secrets, and then a couple of years later you see a competitor in the same business only it's a Chinese competitor. So what do you propose the president do to stop that? BRADY: Well I agree with you, President Trump is right to challenge China. They've been cheating, they've been cheating a long time. It's costing us U.S. jobs. So look, he's the guy who keeps pulling the curtain back, and so we're (ph) exposing the problems in a number of ways, whether it's in NATO or the trade agreements. And so he's right to do this. But here's what I think is occurring, it's becoming increasingly clear this trade dispute, which is escalating, will go one of two ways. We're going to -- either we're going to see a very long, attractive, maybe multi-year trade war with China, the two largest economies in the world. That's going to have economic casualties far beyond just our two countries. Or I think President Trump and President Xi can make a deliberate decision to meet, begin crafting a new set of fair and lasting trade rules that frankly work and level the playing field for American farmers, local businesses in our economy. I'm urging the president to take the second approach because I think I'm confident this president meeting face to face with President Xi can level that playing field, can create a new set of trade rules for both of our countries. BARTIROMO: Have you spoken with the president about this? Have you gotten an answer from him, will he do that? BRADY: He's been on the road, I'm planning to visit with him next week when he returns. We're also working on tax reform 2.0 as well, and so we've got a couple big issues to visit about. BARTIROMO: I know you are and I want to ask you about that, because when I sat down with the president two weeks ago, I asked him if in fact we're going to see another tax cut plan, and here's what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Does the economy need even more stimulus? Are you looking for a phase two tax plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES: We're doing a phase two, we'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that. And it'll be more of a middle class, we did a lot for the middle class but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we're thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and then for the most part, the rest of it would go right to the middle class. (END VIDEO CLIP) Congressman, are you considering that, bringing the corporate rate from 21 percent to 20 percent? BRADY: So we're working with the president on a number of those issues, and Maria, I think the key point here is President Trump's tax cuts and reforms was about changing the economic direction for the better, 2.0 is about changing the culture in Washington where we don't wait 30 years between fixing the tax code. We get better every year, we continue to lead the rest of the world here. And so you're going to see I think permanence of the middle tax cuts and those small business cuts will be the centerpiece of this, and people I think overlook the growth impact long term. That alone could help create a million and a half new jobs in America, continue to raise paychecks significantly in the long term. So that'll be the centerpiece of it. We're working with the president on the rest of the elements of 2.0. BARTIROMO: We -- we really look forward to that, Mr. Chairman. We want to hear more about it as it becomes available. Thanks very much for joining us this morning. BRADY: Great, thanks Maria. BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon, Chairman Kevin Brady joining us. Some Democrats digging in their heels vowing to fight Judge Bret Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination, my next guest knows a lot about the confirmation process. We'll hear from Senator Orrin Hatch next as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\". Back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Democrats ramping up their attacks on President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Here's Hillary Clinton on Friday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SENATOR, NEW YORK: I used to worry that they wanted to turn the clock back to the 1950s. Now I worry they want to turn it back to the 1850s. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: My next guest met with Judge Kavanaugh this week and will be instrumental in his confirmation process. Utah Senator Orrin Hatch is a member and former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has participated in more than a dozen confirmations of Supreme Court nominees. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: Senator, it is always an honor and a pleasure to see you. Thanks for joining me. SEN. ORRIN HATCH, R-UTAH: Well it's always nice to be with you, Maria. You -- you cover things pretty darn well. BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, sir. What are your -- what are your reactions to Judge Kavanaugh? How tough a battle do you think this will be? HATCH: Well I've known him for a long time, but it's -- isn't it unique that here's a -- here's a young fellow who's been around here for a long time, everybody knows him, they know he's honest, they know he's a very talented, very -- very intellectually profound and yet it's the same -- same routine. (Inaudible) start to try and destroy him right off the bat. But he can handle it. He's a very, very fine young man. Very smart and that's had a lot of experience. BARTIROMO: The Democrats are trying to make this about an abortion issue, Senator. They -- HATCH: They always do. BARTIROMO: They -- they keep mentioning Roe v. Wade and this is going to be overturned. What is this about, from your standpoint? HATCH: Well Kavanaugh said that -- that Roe v. Wade is a -- it's set of law (ph). And I suspect that that's probably the way it's going to come out under whoever of our (ph) nominated there. It'll settled law (ph).  But they're -- they're going to -- they don't have anything else to throw at him other than that maybe he'll -- he'll do something on Roe versus Wade. Well, be honest with you, the man is a straightforward guy, he's a -- I -- I've known him for a long time. I've watched him on the court. He's had 12 years of experience on the second highest court in this land, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is no small achievement. BARTIROMO: That's right. HATCH: And he's respected by everybody who's worked with him, including the Democrats. BARTIROMO: Do you think you're going to need Democratic support? HATCH: Well we want Democratic support. I think it's ridiculous that you can't get Democratic support for somebody as good as he is. And I think we'll get some, but -- you know, they've made every appointment to the Judiciary (ph) (inaudible) which is unfortunate. Because you know, they may get the presidency one of these times and they're going to want to have a -- a decent Republican side to work with them to get their nominations through. And -- and I think they ought to -- when you -- when you have people that are very high quality, that are A.B. (ph) lawyers -- in other words, the highest rated lawyers for legal ethics and ability and who clearly have a reputation for being honest and straightforward and knowledgeable about the law, then -- you -- to throw out the -- these kind of arguments against somebody like -- like him is just crazy. BARTIROMO: So -- so size up the Senate for us. I mean, you need 51 votes here to get him through. We saw a pretty positive statement from Susan Collins on -- on Kavanaugh as a pick. We haven't heard from Rand Paul, we haven't heard from Jeff Flake. Do you think you're going to get the votes? HATCH: I expect every Republican to vote for him and I also expect a number of Democrats as well. I think they've got to break through that we're against everything attitude. They hate Trump so badly that -- you know, it's all against Trump. It isn't -- well, I think it's against any Republican judgeship nomination. But -- but they really hate Trump and they really want to do everything they can to hurt Trump. You know, he won the election. All I can say is if Hillary'd won, I'd be doing everything I could to help her to be a great president, if -- if -- if I can . And they ought to be doing the same for him. And -- and if they will, this is a fellow who 10 years ago -- 8 or 9 years ago was a liberal from New York. I mean, they're so stupid they don't realize that they could win him over if they really tried. BARTIROMO: That's a funny -- that's very funny and a good point. HATCH: Well that's a great point. BARTIROMO: You know, they hate him so much despite the fact that the outcomes are pretty good. I mean, let's take a look at some of his outcomes, Senator, because you know, you -- you led, obviously, the tax reform that -- that we saw really -- moved the needle -- HATCH: That was no small thing. That was no small thing. BARTIROMO: No small thing. And now we're talking about -- HATCH: And -- and -- BARTIROMO: -- four percent economic growth when we get the GDP numbers in-- in about a week's time. HATCH: Yes, we haven't had that in a long time. And he's leading -- and look, by any measure, he's been a very successful president. He's -- he's a little bit bombastic from time to time, but I like that too. I -- I think it's just great that he gets out there and doesn't take any crap from anybody. But he -- yes (ph) but he -- but he's -- he's done really well for somebody who's never been in politics before. I'm starting to think maybe we ought to get more of those people who've never been in politics before. BARTIROMO: But you are not as confident about the trade issues. I want to get into those trade issues, because I think most people understand that China has been stealing from us -- for us -- from us, rather for decades. And they want somebody to get China to stop stealing intellectual property, stop the transfer of -- of technology to Chinese firms, and also open up the Chinese economy. So that I understand, the aluminum and steel tariffs, well that's a different story. What do you say? HATCH: Well I don't think they're going to help anybody, I think they're just going to hurt American businesses and, you know, my home state -- my home state's going to be hit very hard because of these tariffs. Now be that as it may, if they were good for the whole country, I'd be -- you know, I'd be nullified (ph). But the fact is, I think our country's not going to do well because of these tariffs. I'm not a big tariff fan, and I'm disappointed that the president has taken that -- that route, and I hope that he gets off of it pretty soon. Now he's had some, in my opinion, very bad advice, but he actually believes that too. BARTIROMO: Real quick before you, Senator, do you believe you can get Kavanaugh in place before the Supreme Court's new term starts October 1? HATCH: That's our intention, and we should be able to do that. It's going to be hard for the Democrats, but they lost the election and they can't just keep throwing up these scare tactics all the time. And -- and thinking they can get away with it. BARTIROMO: Yes, there certainly is a lot of that. Senator, it's good to see you this morning, thanks very much. HATCH: Well it's really great to sit with you, you're great. BARTIROMO: Thank you very much, Senator. Coming up next, Democratic leaders demanding that President Trump cancel tomorrow's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Does the president need to be careful, what should happen, our power panel is weighing in as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\". Next up, Mary Kissel, Charlie Hurt, stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A growing number of Democrats demanding that President Trump cancel his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, scheduled for tomorrow, even some Republicans are advising the president to proceed with caution after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officials for election meddling. What can we expect when the two leaders sit face-to-face tomorrow? We bring in our panel now. Mary Kissel is a member of the Wall Street Journal's editorial board, Charlie Hurt is an opinion editor and columnist with the Washington Times. Both are Fox News contributors. Good to see you both. Thank you so much for joining us. Mary, what's most important for the meeting tomorrow. MARY KISSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I think Vladimir Putin wants rehabilitation on the world stage after the 2014 invasion of Crimea, the downing of MH17, you remember that civilian airliner, Russia has been blamed for that, killed almost 300 people. The incursions into Syria, the war crimes he committed there. And that's what he's really craving in this meeting with Trump. BARTIROMO: Will President Trump give that to him? KISSEL: Well, look, the thing to know about Vladimir Putin is that he creates problems, and then he'll says, oh, I'll come to you and let's solve this problem together. So, you know, I would expect Vladimir Putin to come in and say, hey, I'll solve the problem that I created in Syria, and in exchange, can you please just recognize this other problem that I created by invading Crimea, a sovereign country. So, President Trump has to be very careful. He's a wiley operator. He snuckerred two prior presidents. And I just think President Trump has to go in with his eyes wide open. BARTIROMO: Charlie, obviously we are going to be hearing about the gas pipeline and the relationship between Russia and Europe. What's most important from your standpoint? CHARLIE HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, I do think that certainly the gas pipeline is going to come up. Donald Trump has made no secret that he thinks that that's a terrible, terrible deal. And it is, quite frankly, in terms of putting Europe -- Western Europe at sort of a disadvantage in terms of -- if they're really genuinely concerned about Russia, as I think that they certainly should be. But I also think that the president has made clear, you know, he doesn't have very high expectations. He wants to -- at least he said that, and I tend to believe him when he says that. But I do think that -- you know, this guy, and I'm not trying to make a direct comparison here, or anything like this, but I do think it's sort of important when you look back at Ronald Reagan, Reagan loved to meet with people like this to size them up, to size up his adversaries, and sort of get a personal feel for them. Well, we are seeing the same thing out of Donald Trump. And I know that a lot of -- especially the people that hate Donald Trump, this gives them the willies. But there is some precedent for this. And I do think that there's some wisdom in a desire to sort of personally get -- size up an adversary. BARTIROMO: Both John Radcliffe and Devin Nunes joined me earlier this morning, and they both said, look, we knew all about these Russian indictments, and these individuals that were meddling in the election a year and half ago. Why announce this now, and by the way, why are we generating so much energy on a situation where we don't have jurisdiction over them anyway, Mary. These Russian individuals are never going to be held to justice. KISSEL: No, of course they're not. But actually, you know, I'm not focusing so much on that, Maria, as I am in the broken deal in Syria. I mean, Putin is humiliating the United States. We made a deal between the U.S., Jordan, and Russia to deescalte in southwest Syria. Russia is providing air cover for Syrian and Iranian forces blatantly. So, you know, they are humiliating us there. Why are we rewarding Putin with a summit and handshake in front of the world's cameras? That, to me is a much bigger deal. BARTIROMO: Should he not do the meeting, then? KISSEL: I don't know what the point is of the summit. He's already met Vladimir Putin. You know, where is the concession on Russia's part? You know, having the United States president go and meet with a world leader gives him legitimacy. BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Charlie Hurt, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much. Mary Kissel, always a pleasure. Thank you. That will do it for us right now on Sunday Morning Futures. Thanks so much for joining me today. I'm Maria Bartiromo, stay with me tomorrow morning bright and early on Fox Business Network. Special programing beginning at 5:00 a.m. on the summit. \"MediaBuzz\" happens right after this break.

            "article_content": "Rapper Kanye West speaks to President Donald Trump and others in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 11, 2018, in Washington. (AP) In the beginning, it was safe to ignore Kanye West and his growing bromance with President Trump. After all, West is a performer, which makes it easy to discount his political talk, and he is married to a Kardashian, which, well, enough said. But recent events demand attention. First came West\u2019s Sept. 29 appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d where he rapped in his red Make America Great Again hat and\u00a0praised Trump in a speech, most of which NBC cut from its telecast. Then there was\u00a0Thursday\u2019s spectacle in the Oval Office. Once again, his stream-of-consciousness commentary veered from nonsense to common sense and included references to the 13th Amendment, which forbids slavery, and his feeling of being \u201cprogrammed\u201d as a black man to support only liberal politicians. There was no denying those events were intriguing and entertaining, but I still didn\u2019t regard any of it as politically significant \u2014 until the left-wing media went absolutely bonkers on him. Their extraordinarily venomous and personal attacks on West reminded me of the left\u2019s unhinged smears of Brett Kavanaugh and Trump. Some sank to citing West\u2019s documented mental health issues and many invoked his race in pejorative terms, making them especially outrageous. A black anchor on CNN accused West of putting on a \u201cminstrel show,\u201d a black pundit on the same panel called him an \u201cattention whore\u201d and \u201cthe token Negro of the Trump administration.\u201d Another chipped in with, \u201cKanye West is what happens when Negroes don\u2019t read.\u201d A black New York Times columnist said the White House scene was \u201cwhite supremacy by ventriloquism\u201d and a white MSNBC anchor called it \u201can assault on our White House.\u201d Whoa, Nellie. What nerve did he touch? The first thing to notice are the double standards. If conservatives criticized a black liberal in those words, the liberal media would let loose a chorus of \u201cracism\u201d and \u00addemand that every Republican \u00addenounce the commentators. But this time, it was the liberal \u00admedia itself making the offensive comments, so Democratic politicians were not required to take a stand. Naturally, none did. The willingness of individual voters to buck historic group trends is a hopeful sign. Fundamentally, America is a nation of free individuals, not of tribes or groups. Yet it was the sheer volume of the hatred, and the uniformity of it, that really got my attention. What\u2019s this really about? My conclusion is that the outpouring of wrath suggests the answer. To wit, if Kanye West is important enough to be targeted by so many in the media for character assassination, he must also be dangerous. And if he\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s in the same way that conservative speakers are dangerous to college snowflakes. Any dissent from the ruling coercive liberalism might be contagious, and therefore must be silenced. Diversity of thought cannot be permitted. So we can assume the left fears West could be a leading indicator that Trump\u2019s appeal to the working and middle classes is cutting across racial barriers. And precisely because Democrats are making a fetish of race, gender and identity politics, a prominent racial and cultural force like Kanye West leaving the fold could be the start of a movement toward conservative values. Which is why he must be silenced by any means necessary. It may be too late, for there are clear reasons why he and others would dissent from the coercive orthodoxy. Consider that black unemployment has reached historic lows because of the Trump economic boom, and one report says about 800,000 more African-Americans have jobs now than had them at the end of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. These changes are giving rise to new, confident voices such as Candace Owens, a black commentator and activist, who supported West and blasted his critics. \u201cThe paradigm has shifted,\u201d Owens said on Fox News. \u201cBlack conservatives will no longer be fearful. Black conservatives are willing to speak out. We are excited. It \u00adfinally feels like it\u2019s our time.\u201d It\u2019s also possible, of course, that West is a one-off, a disrupter of no real political consequence. That would not be surprising given the hard facts of racial politics for the last 40 years. Democrats, regardless of their race, generally count on getting \u00adupwards of 90 percent of the black vote. And the election of Obama seemed to seal party allegiance for years to come. Black antipathy toward Trump was especially strong, stemming from his \u201cbirther\u201d campaign against Obama. Many viewed the attempt to delegitimize the first black president as inherently racist, a view Obama did not discourage as he campaigned for Hillary Clinton. Trump\u2019s feuds with black athletes, especially LeBron James, also feed the negative narrative. Not surprisingly, exit polls from the 2016 presidential contest showed Clinton getting about 89 percent of the black vote and Trump just 8 percent. That dramatic tilt confirmed that black voters remain the most reliable group in the Dems\u2019 coalition, outpacing Latinos and Jews, with those groups generally giving the party about 75 percent of their votes. Still, recent polls show Trump gaining support among black voters, with his approval rating as high as 36 percent in an August Rasmussen survey. Others, including Gallup, show he has gained, but have him topping out in the low to mid-teens. We will know more after the midterms, but I generally believe the willingness of individual voters to buck historic group trends is a hopeful sign. Fundamentally, America is a nation of free individuals, not of tribes or groups, and our republic is healthier when both parties are forced to compete for every vote. Any vote taken for granted is a vote not earned and leaves politicians free to break their promises without suffering any consequences. Surely we\u2019ve all had enough of that.

            "article_content": "Schiff plan: Torment Republicans if Democrats take the House. Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy weighs in on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Democrats are expected to re-open the investigation into alleged collusion between Russian officials and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign if they regain the House of Representatives majority in next month's midterm elections. The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence was the only House panel to investigate Russian meddling. This past April, the committee's Republicans\u00a0said they found \u201cno evidence\u201d of collusion between the Russian government and Trump campaign.\u00a0Democrats said Republicans ignored key facts and important witnesses. However, while some on the left wing have said they wanted to restart parts of the investigation if they win the House, others said there could be a political cost if they overreach. Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other lawmakers have said they're closely watching special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and the Senate's Russia probe to look for gaps that they could fill. If Mueller issues any findings, their investigative plans could change. Schiff has said his party would have to\u00a0\"ruthlessly prioritize the most important matters first.\" Among them: whether Russians used laundered money for transactions with the Trump Organization and what then-candidate Trump knew about\u00a0a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan. Democrats also may look into direct messages on Twitter between Donald Trump Jr. -- the president's eldest son -- and WikiLeaks, the website that released emails from top Democratic officials during the 2016 campaign. Trump Jr. has released those direct messages, in which the website urged him to publicize its leaks. House Republicans limited their Russia investigation to the intelligence panel, which traditionally conducts most of its business in secret. Democrats could spread the investigation over several other committees, opening it up and allowing for public hearings with top Trump officials. OBAMA, AT NEVADA RALLY, TELLS VOTERS TO REMEMBER 'WHO STARTED' ECONOMIC RECOVERY Democrats on the intelligence committee previously released a list of\u00a0several dozen people whom the committee hadn't yet interviewed when the investigation ended. The list included former Trump campaign advisers Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos --\u00a0all of whom have pleaded guilty to various charges in the Mueller probe and have cooperated with prosecutors. Lawmakers might also call back key witnesses, such as\u00a0Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who\u00a0pleaded guilty in federal court\u00a0to campaign-finance violations and other charges this past August. Another callback could go out to\u00a0prominent Trump supporter Erik Prince, who met with Russians during the campaign and was defiant in an interview with the intelligence panel in December. TRUMP COMMITS TO PLAN FOR MIDDLE-INCOME TAX CUT AFTER ELECTION DAY A Democratic House could try to move legislation to protect\u00a0Mueller. Trump repeatedly has criticized Mueller and his investigation, calling it a witch hunt. Prompted by concerns that Trump may try to fire Mueller, the GOP-led Senate Judiciary Committee approved legislation in April that would give any special counsel a 10-day window to seek expedited judicial review of a firing. The bill would put into law existing Justice Department regulations that a special counsel can only be fired for good cause. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to take up the bill in the Senate. However,\u00a0House Democrats would be expected to pass their own special counsel protection bill if they take the majority. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "What do the moves signal about the White House's approach to both countries? President of The Foundation for Defense of Democracies Cliff May responds. This is a rush transcript from \"Journal: Editorial Report,\" August 11, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST: Welcome to the \"Journal: Editorial Report.\" I'm Paul Gigot. Voters in five states headed to the polls this week and some razor-thin results has spurred a debate within the Republican Party over just what role President Trump should play in the midterm campaign. Although the president declared victory on Twitter this week, posting that he was five for five with candidates he endorsed in Tuesday's races. Narrow margins in a special election in Ohio and in the gubernatorial primary in Kansas are causing some to raise questions about his claim that a giant red wave is coming this November. Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, Columnist Kim Strassel, and editorial board member, Allysia Finley. Dan, after you look at Tuesday's results, how much trouble is the Republican Party in in November? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: I would say the Republican Party is, indeed, in trouble, Paul. Look, the baseline is that Ohio 12 race where Troy Balderson seems to have won by less than 1 percent with a Democrat. Look, on the scale of one to 10 in competitive House races, Ohio 12 should have been about a nine for the Republicans. Balderson should have won that by more than less than 1 percent. The remaining competitive seats, and there are about 34 of them, are all maybe a five or a six. They are going to be much tighter than Ohio 12. The math suggests that whatever happened there, perhaps women in the upper-middle class suburbs staying home, whatever happened there, is going to lean heavily on the remaining competitive Republican districts. There's no way to sugar coat it, Paul. That is the conclusion from what happened there. GIGOT: Charlie Cook, who analyzes House races, said there's 68 more House seats that Republicans now hold that are less Republican than Ohio 12 seat. So that puts -- a lot of these are going to be in play, Kim, particularly the suburban seats, the rural areas Trump and the Republican Party still holding very strong, but it's these suburban swing districts which are most at play. KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Yes, you are seeing that in these election results. You are seeing that in polling. The Republicans have problem in suburbia, particularly among college-educated voters, women college-eduated voters, who are very down on Donald Trump. And so if you look at that Ohio race, for instance, where Balderson really fell apart was in the suburban part of that district. The farther you got away from Columbus, the more rural the area, he tallied and racked up the votes. But and it is still barely enough to win. But this is something that's a dangerous proposition for Republicans having to rely on simply large turnout from rural voters everywhere. GIGOT: Allysia, let's broaden the field a little bit to the governors' races, which we know we tend not to give much attention to as the Congress, but are very important. And Republicans have, I think, 31 Republican seats now, including most of the upper Midwest. But what did we learn from Michigan's primaries? ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: Well, there was a much higher, like 130,000 more Democrats voted in the primaries than Republicans. And I think you're going to really have a hard time in the upper Midwest. You said Scott Walker is up for election -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: Wisconsin. FINLEY Browner in Illinois. Again, Michigan is a vacancy where Bill Schuette won the Republican primary. He wrapped himself around Donald Trump. But Donald Trump only has a 35 percent approval rating in Michigan. And I think also if you look at Kansas, if Kris Kobach wins, he's run on a very anti-immigrant line, I think that's going to really alienate voters, moderate voters even there. GIGOT: Jeff Colyer is the competitor. We don't know who will get the nomination. That's very, very close. Kansas should be a Republican way up and you're saying -- FINLEY: Kathleen Sebelius, the former HHS secretary in the Obama administration, was the governor there, so they have had Democratic governors. GIGOT: Kim, I know that you have been talking to sources in GOP. What are they telling you about, I guess, the optimistic line? What's the case that they are going to upset convention here and do better than anyone thinks, even if it's not quite a red wave? STRASSEL: Yes, so here is what they'll say in the White House. Some people have been critical of the president going out and doing these rallies, talking about very controversial subjects, like immigration and trade, saying this is what is alienating these voters. Now the White House and others will make the opposite claim. They say, look, the only reason Balderson won was because Trump went out there and he excited the rural voters and he got them to turn out there. We believe that we would not have gotten a lot of these suburban voters any way. They baked it in against Trump. So the only thing we can do to combat that is get out our base, really turn them out and -- and so that's what you see happening. It's working in Ohio. So we will be able to replicate that come fall. That's their argument. GIGOT: So their argument is, I guess, Dan, let's polarize the election on cultural issues like immigration, for example, immigration enforcement, and soft sell the economy, which is doing great, and tax cuts, let's not focus on those, let's make this a cultural battle. Smart strategy? HENNINGER: It works for Donald Trump, there's no question about it. The question is, does it work for the other individual Republican candidates in individual races, such as Barbara Comstock running in northern Virginia, where she is in a very tight race. And cultural issues do not play. Doesn't play in the seat that's being vacated in New Jersey by Rodney Frelinghuysen. Clearly, a very centrist seat in which the Republican is competing with a highly-financed former Marine, woman and prosecutor. In those situations, Paul, I don't think the cultural issues are going to play. They are going to have to run on what they have achieved, which is an extraordinarily strong economy. And some of these candidates are asking, let me do it myself, I can carry it if the president doesn't come in here and ruffle the waters with immigration and trade wars. GIGOT: I guess the politics of this are different in the Senate, Allysia, briefly. You have Trump in the cultural division. May work better in some of the states, like North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana where Trump won. FINLEY: Maybe, but you have to consider that there are three Senate seats, Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee, that Republicans currently hold that could be in play for Democrats for just the opposite reason, in so far that immigration backlash against the president's immigration policies may hurt Republicans there. GIGOT: Particularly in Nevada. FINLEY: Nevada and Arizona. GIGOT: Less so in Tennessee. FINLEY: In Tennessee, but they have a strong Democratic candidate there. GIGOT: In Phil Bredesen, the former governor. All right, thank you all. Still ahead, President Trump goes on the attack, blaming bad environmental laws for exacerbating the devastating wild fires in California. We will take a look at the president's claims and what is contributing to the blazes when we come back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JERRY BROWN, D-CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR: This is part of the trend, the new normal that we have to deal with. And we are dealing with it humanly, financially and governmentally. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: Firefighters in California battling several major blazes across the state, including the largest wild fire in its history. The Mendocino Complex Fire is now bigger than the city of Los Angeles and officials say it may not be contained until September. President Trump seized on the issue earlier this week, suggesting that California's environmental policies have exacerbated at least a dozen large fires in the state right now. The president tweeting that, \"Bad environmental laws are magnifying the fires by not allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized.\" He added, \"Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading.\" We are back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and Allysia Finley. So California, Allysia, why are the fires as severe as they are? FINLEY: Well, they were pretty severe last year and they've started earlier this year. One reason is the really high temperatures, especially up in the north. You have a heat wave, high heavy winds -- GIGOT: Right. FINLEY: -- and a lot of dry vegetation after seven or eight years of drought. We had -- plus, you had actually one wet year, which -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: The last, the previous year. FINLEY: That was the previous year, which actually provided more vegetation overgrowth, and so the fires have more fuel to burn. GIGOT: OK, let's take a couple of the president's issues. The water. Is there a shortage of water to fight the fires? FINLEY: Not to fight the fires. But there's a shortage of water in California, a huge shortage. GIGOT: What's the problem? FINLEY: The problem is that there are environmental restrictions to protect fish, mainly the smelt and salmon in the delta where all the rivers in the north run in to. GIGOT: And that's where the water is in the mountains of Sierra -- (CROSSTALK) FINLEY: Right. And Lake Shasta. And they are using some of that water to fight the fires. But because of these pumping restrictions, very little of the water actually moves down -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: Where does it go? FINLEY: Instead, it basically goes out to the ocean. GIGOT: So they literally take fresh water -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: -- that they could use down south and pump it out to sea? FINLEY: Pumping, right. (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: OK. So what that does, it does not hurt in the north where the fires are now, where they have plenty of water to fight it. But where it hurts is creating further dry conditions in the central valley and the south. FINLEY: And in the south land, and in southern California where you've had fires. One now raging in southern Orange County, south Orange County. GIGOT: All right, Kim, let me go to you. I know you follow closely when it comes to tree clearing and fires in the west. Is the president on stronger ground on that claim he made? STRASSEL: Oh, absolutely. This is the ground-zero problem for why you are having fires. And, by the way, not just in California, but throughout the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, other places where, going back 20 years, the federal forest -- the logging ban in federal forests kicked off a trend, and you see it, too, driven at the state level by very bad environmentalist policies. It's a leave-it-alone approach. The USDA did a report in December and said 129 million dead trees in California. And there's a reticence at the government level to go in and really do any lugging, cutting, thinning. And this is what's providing the fuel for these fires. When they get raging, you can't stop them. GIGOT: This is a puzzle for me, Kim. And I'm a midwestern and not a westerner. But why wouldn't environmentalists want healthy forests? So why wouldn't you want to clear some of this stuff out so that it is less vulnerable to these raging fires? STRASSEL: Well, it's the problem with most modern green environmental policy, is it actually doesn't do much to help nature. It is an involuntary reflexive belief that man should not interfere at all. You do not manage nature. You let nature take its course. But if you are going to do that, you going to end up -- for instance, right now, they estimated and Sierra Nevada has had four times as many trees in them as you would in a normal healthy forest. We used to be able to have these massive fires that can just burn and clear everything out, but we can't really allow that anymore given population and the devastation they cause. So your alternative is to go in and manage them mechanically with cutting. GIGOT: Dan, Jerry Brown, the governor out there, has -- he blames climate change. Of course, he blames just about everything bad that happens out there on climate change. But at some point, when do you take responsibility, as a political leader, and -- OK, let's say he's right and this is related to change in climate, the government has to do something. HENNINGER: They do have to do something, but Jerry Brown and the Democrats, the greens, have put themselves in a position where they're very simply incapable of moving. And I want to pick up the point that Kim was just making. One alternative to this is, in these vast areas of running controlled burns, where you burn down some of the forest to clear the area, I mean, they are forests. They are full of trees. Trees are wood and wood burns. But for the last 100 years or 200 years or so, this country has set aside vast areas of the west and they have not -- and they've been untouched, as Kim suggested. They are too big for the federal government to manage, even if they were going in and doing that sort of thing. And as she suggested, if you allow logging companies to go in, private owners, they would be responsible for keeping these forests in healthy shape. They are not healthy. GIGOT: Quick question, Allysia. How much does the state of California spend on tree cutting? FINLEY: Very little relative to how much they are spending on the electric car subsidies. GIGOT: Which is about -- FINLEY: They are spending about $300 million on electric cars subsidies and giving, maybe spending $30 million on tree cutting. GIGOT: So 10 times on electric car subsidies for rich people in the suburbs. All right, when we come back, the Trump administration stepping up sanctions this week on Iran and Russia. What the moves signal about the administration's approach to both countries, next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKK HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: We are going to continue to be loud with the international community that there have to be changes from Iran. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: The Trump administration stepping up sanctions this week on both Iran and Russia. The White House said Wednesday that it will impose fresh sanctions on Moscow after determining that it used a nerve agent on British soil in March in an attack that sickened the former Russian spy and his daughter and killed a mother of three. This, as re-imposed sanctions took effect on Tehran, the first since President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year. The president warned Tuesday that anyone doing business with Iran will not be doing business with the United States. Cliff May is the founder and president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. So, Cliff, welcome back. Good to see you again. Let's start, though, with Turkey. I want to talk briefly here at least about Turkey. The president using sanctions and serious sanctions to try to get the Turks to return Pastor Brunson to the United States. What do you think of the use of sanctions for that purpose? CLIFF MAY, FOUNDER & PRESIDENT, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES: Well, I think, in general, this administration recognizes a rule, and that is any nefarious behavior that you do not punish, you, in effect, license. So we have multiple countries now taking Americans hostage. That Turkey should take an innocent pastor -- he's been there 20 years. He ministers to a small flock of Protestants. He's being accused of things there's no evidence whatsoever that he is in any way involved in anything nefarious there. The idea that he can be held hostage and various demands made on this is pretty astounding, especially when you consider Turkey is a NATO ally, And I think Trump has been very frustrated by Erdogan on this and on other scores as well. GIGOT: But it's going back and forth. Erdogan says, I'm not going to give in. And Trump is ratcheting up, saying he will double metals' tariffs on Turkey. And you've seen what's happened to the Turkish Lira, just really falling out of bed and creating real nervousness across a lot of currency markets. So there may be some global implications here. How risky is this? MAY: It's risky, but it's mostly risky to Turkey. And you would think that Erdogan would do the rational thing, which is say, OK, America is my ally, we are NATO members, I can't be holding an innocent American in prison for years, and I have to -- I have to do something about that or I have to make up with them. Instead, of course, Erdogan is moving closer and closer to Russia. And NATO, after all, is meant to protect Europe from Russia predominantly. He is also undercutting American policy vis-a-vis Iran. So he is the best friend-emy, certainly an unreliable ally. And I think a crisis is coming with Turkey sooner than later. GIGOT: Interesting. You mentioned Russia. President -- the Trump administration imposed -- ratcheting up sanctions, this time for chemical weapons use, that nerve agent in the U.K. But here is the question, John, a lot of people are asking. The Trump administration did this. How does this mesh, fit in with the president's clear desire to have better relations with Vladimir Putin? MAY: Yes, you know, what's interesting here is that Trump's rhetoric has been conciliatory towards Putin. His policies have been very tough, I think arguably tougher than any administration we have seen. We've had five sets of sanctions this year alone. This is going to be very difficult for the Russian economy. We are already seeing the Ruble fall. We are seeing other problems with the economy and -- in Russia. And more sanctions are coming. So his policies are very tough. He's really insisting that Russia begin to change its behavior even while he, rhetorically, certainly, in Helsinki, is being very solicitous of President Putin. GIGOT: It's interesting to watch that contradiction and see how it evolves. Let's turn to Iran, the third country that has seen tougher sanctions. In this, the president is disagreeing with his European allies, who don't like the fact that the U.S. has imposed these sanctions and moved this week to try to protect its own businesses and say you can do business with Iran. But is the president winning this disagreement with the E.U. governments? MAY: Yes, the president is winning. I think -- I think it's distressing that our European allies are trying to undermine the president's policy here. I know they don't particularly like President Trump, but the policy is meant to create change in Iran. At the very least, we should not be funding the nefarious behaviors of Iran, whether it's supporting Hezbollah or Shiite militias in Syria or in Bashar al-Assad, supporting the Houthi rebels, continuing with missile programs. We know that Iran in various ways was violating the Iran nuclear agreement, the JCPOA. The Europeans have been trying to undermine our policies. They are not succeeding because Europe is still relatively free. The governments can -- can't tell the businesses what to do and the businesses are being told by their compliance officers and others, look, we can do business with Iran but we will cut out from the U.S. market, and the U.S. market is absolutely essential to us, the Iranian market is not. Increasingly, we are seeing European businesses saying we are going to abide by the U.S. sanctions, we don't want secondary sanctions on us and we don't want to be cut out of the market. That's very frustrating for the governments. But the governments of Europe deserve to be frustrated because they should be acting with us to curve the nefarious behaviors of Iran. GIGOT: Cliff, we don't have much time, but let me ask you one final question what about Iran. And that is John Bolton this week, the White House national security advisor, said the U.S. policy towards Iran is not regime change, it's design to change its behavior. Is that really true or do they secretly, privately really want regime change? MAY: Look, they cry no salty ears for regime change to happen. But if they can change the behavior of the regime, that is helpful. If the regime says we have to cut back on some of our overseas commitments to various terrorist groups, that's useful. If the regime says let's sit down and negotiate a better JCPOA, we have to do it, that's helpful. If nothing else, there are protests in the streets and the Iranians know who to blame. They blame their own government for the depravations they're suffering because they know that the oil wealth is being spent on Hezbollah and Hamas and Houthi rebels and others, not on them. And I expect they'll be infighting among the ruling mullahs as a result of this as well. GIGOT: All right, thank you, Cliff May. Appreciate it. Still ahead, Facebook and YouTube banning controversial radio host, Alex Jones, and setting off debate over social media and free speech. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST: Facebook and YouTube banned controversial radio personality and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, this week saying the InfoWars host violated their policy against hate speech. Jones' detractors say the move was a long-time coming, but others argue that it's just the latest and not the last example of social media companies silencing voices they don't agree with. And they are pointing to a tweet by Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, who wrote this week, quote, \"InfoWars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that use sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart. These companies must do more than take down one Web site. The survival of our democracy depends on it.\" We are back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel, and Wall Street Journal deputy editor features editor, Kyle Peterson. Kyle, welcome. Let's talk about the legality first, try to break this down. These companies, is it -- can they decide what runs on their platforms legally? DAN PETERSON, DEPUTY EDITORIALS FEATURES EDITOR: Yes, absolutely. It's private property. That content is living on their servers. And what Facebook wants to do is specifically is Facebook sees itself as a community. It wants to be a placed that teenagers feel comfortable spending some time. And so what -- the way I like to think about it, when you're on Facebook, you're not on a public forum. You're at Mark Zuckerberg's open mic night, and if you get up on stage start singing the Nazi national anthem, be prepared to be asked to leave. GIGOT: You decided to run an op-ed in our paper and it's libelist, though. We are responsible. They are shielded from even that -- from those kinds of liable suits, are they not? PETERSON: Yes. There was a law passed in the 1990s that gave them immunity from that, specifically for user-generated content. So the difference is, a lot of the stuff that goes on Facebook, most of it, virtually all of it is not reviewed by anyone before being posted. You, as the user, get to put it up. GIGOT: Do you agree with that? Should we not have that exception to these platforms? PETERSON: That's a tough question. If you remove that exception, it's hard to see how those companies can operate, because they would have to employ hundreds of thousands of people to review everything that possibly went up. They are trying to go after the problem with algorithms and, reportedly, they're having some success, specifically with getting the machines to recognize violent content and to recognize nudity and take that stuff down more or less automatically. GIGOT: As a policy matter, as a principle matter for the publishers, you agree -- you think they should -- they were right to take down Alex Jones? PETERSON: I think that, honestly, that's for users to decide. The Internet is a big place, and Twitter came out this week and specifically said it would not ban out Alex Jones. GIGOT: Because they hadn't violated Twitter's rules. PETERSON: Right. So people had a choice. If they want to live in a more walled garden, they can go to Facebook and they can feel comfortable having their teenagers on there. And if they want more free speech, if they want to see what Alex Jones is putting up, they can go to Twitter. GIGOT: Kim, what do you think about this as a matter of policy on the part of Facebook? As I recall, you did a Praeger video linked to your book on, of all things, free speech, and it was, in fact, banned for a while? KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Yes, they claim it was by algorithm but it was a very odd situation. Look, I agree with Kyle. They absolutely have the right to do this. They're not common carriers. They are not required to just offer their platform for anyone, no matter what their views. Should they have? No. I have two reasons why. One, it is going to fuel the views among conservatives that there's a disproportionate crack-down on conservative voices. And that's going to further polarize the debate over social media and may come back and hurt these companies, who even now, Republican congressional members are gunning for them. But look, also, I think it was a problem of how they did it. The issue with Alex Jones for a lot of people is supposedly that he publishes fake news. But that's not why they removed his stuff. They did it because they said that his content was hate speech. That is a very slippery slope. And it gives these groups the ability to essentially censor the way the Senator that you mentioned at beginning was talking about, any views that they don't like under the very broad category of hate speech. GIGOT: Alex Jones, Dan, is a pretty particular voice. I don't consider him a conservative in any normal sense of the word. He's a just a provocateur. He spreads false information. He spread falsehood about Chobani and immigrants. He was sued and he had to retract that and apologize to get a lawsuit against him dropped. He said falsehoods about the Sandy Hook massacre. I mean, if you're going to ban -- so I mean, that would be the argument they would make. But he's not a traditional conservative. And don't put us on the slippery-slope to say we are going to start banning other conservative voices. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, that is the voice -- I mean, that's the argument conservatives will make, and they should make it.  I mean, you know, InfoWars, there's probably part of the population out there that is susceptible to those kinds of conspiracy theories. They have always been out there. But this is a country of 325 million people. Let's say a million people have attached themselves to InfoWars and Alex Jones. Is that a threat to the country? Well, it wasn't just Facebook and YouTube that banned him. He's now been banned by virtually all the social media platforms, LinkedIn, Pinterest. Apple has taken him off their iPod listings. The only real platform that he's on now is, indeed, Twitter. So the question is, if you sort of -- where do you draw the line? I think Chris Murphy, the Democratic Senator, in the remark at the beginning, let the cat out of the bag. People like him will push beyond Alex Jones and start including, say Rush Limbaugh, as a purveyor of hate speech. And there will be pressure on these sites to draw the line much more broadly against conservative opinions. GIGOT: Kyle, what about that argument, that this is just the start of what would be an attempt to ban conservative voices generally? PETERSON: The question I would have for people making the argument is, in April, Facebook had banned the white nationalist, Richard Spencer. And did it make the news? Not really. So the question I have is, what's different now? And the only answer I can come up with now is Alex Jones is pretty good at making a raucous. GIGOT: You think they can make those distinctions? PETERSON: I think they have to. Who else can make those distinctions? It's Facebook's decision to make. And their users can decide how to react when they do. GIGOT: All right, an interesting debate. Still ahead, the Big Apple declares war on Uber, voting to cap the number of ride-hailing cars on its roads. So will other cities do the same? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: The Big Apple putting the squeeze on a rapidly growing industry this week, capping the number of for-hire vehicles it allows on its streets. The New York city council voting to address what it says are a number of issues that have cropped up as the use of Uber, Lyft, and other ride-hailing services has grown, including increased traffic, a dip in public transit use, and financial woes in the taxi industry. So how will this affect riders and drivers? And will other cities follow New York's example? We are back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and Allysia Finley. Kim, let me start with you. Bill de Blasio said this week, he took a victory lap, and said, we did this to show that we will not back down from any big company. Why did he really do it? STRASSEL: He really did it to protect the cab industry in New York, which they gave a lot of other reasons, oh, you know, congestions, people are not riding the subway anymore. That's not what this is. This is about protecting a very complex system of regulations and medallions that New York issues. And they have kept the number of cab medallions artificially low to drive up the price of them and to regulate how many cabs were there.  That all got blown apart when these app companies started coming in. And it has put a lot of distress on cab companies. And there has been some financial fallout. But that's called new technology. And the answer shouldn't be to now try to extend that licensing and regulation to the entire new field, but rather to start over and deregulate and let competition work. GIGOT: Dan, is this going to fix congestion in New York? I know, as a loyal New Yorker, somehow I'm not seeing that? HENNINGER: No, it is not going to fix congestion, unless the city does a better job of managing the construction projects that have closed down the lanes of every other street in Manhattan. GIGOT: And the subways. What about the subways? How many -- how many -- (CROSSTALK) HENNINGER: Let's talk about the subways, because it's a big element here. Ride-sharing in Uber, Lyft and cars like that is being used by people who are abandoning the subways. And it's not just the wealthy in Manhattan. It's mainly middle-class workers who live in the outer boroughs, the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn. They would rather ride-share than take the subway. It's a vote of no confidence in the subways, which have a huge responsibility to fix their infrastructure at enormous costs. And if people pull away from subways, they are going to erode further. And I think the city solution has been, rather than deal with the reality of the public transportation system failing, they're simply going to suppress Uber and Lyft. GIGOT: Let me put up here the \"New York Post\" headline on Friday this week, \"Transit Apocalypse,\" about the latest shutdowns in the subways and the delays, which are so extraordinary, Allysia. Bill de Blasio, good Socialist, good liberal, why would he care about the taxi cartel? ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: They're big donors in city council. GIGOT: Break the code. (LAUGHTER) So that's the reason he does it. But I guess they want to push everybody into subways as well? (CROSSTALK) FINLEY: I think that's exactly right. The last two years, you had decline in subway users, a decline in revenues as well. GIGOT: That's not because of the ride services as much as it is -- FINLEY: Because they are breaking -- subways are breaking down. GIGOT: Right. FINLEY: And 70,000 delays per month, and that has not improved, despite all of the billions that they are pumping into the system. And so this is-- the ride-shares are an escape route. They're charter schools for transportation. GIGOT: Competition, for charter schools for public school's competition. FINLEY: Right. Definitely. They want to keep people in the public system. GIGOT: Kim, what do you think the future is for ride-sharing services across the countries. Millions of Americans, tens of millions, use them. They've become a great alternative. If you're new to a city, you don't know how to work the subway. The cabs aren't available. You call an Uber, you call a Lyft, you get a ride. Are other cities going to start to restrict this for the same reasons? STRASSEL: Yes. This is one of the big new urban battles across the country, because you are going to have other cities -- the ones that are actively debating this right now, as far away as Texas to the west coast. And you're going to have politicians who are going to want to do the union bidding them and protect their cab monopolies. And you'll have residents of the cities who are going to revolt. And in the past, the fear of that revolt has reined in these politicians and they have lost some of these prior battles against Uber and Lyft. They now seem to be plunging ahead anyway. But this could reverberate badly on some politicians. It seems to elude them, but if they would have tried so hard to protect their horse- and-carriage industry, they wouldn't even have a cab industry right now. Change is coming and the consumers want it. GIGOT: Yes, I think sometimes Bill de Blasio would have been a great mayor in the horse-and-buggy era. When we come back, 10 years after the 2008 financial panic, our own James Freeman brings us the untold story of the Citigroup bailout and other alarming episodes from the 200-plus-year history of one of the nation's largest banks. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: It's been 10 years since the 2008 financial crisis and the bailout of too-big-to-fail financial institutions, like Citigroup. And in a new book, James Freeman and Vern McKinley tell the untold story not only of Citi's rescue, but of the 206-year history of what was once the nation's largest bank. James Freeman is assistant editorial page editor at the \"Wall Street Journal\" and coauthor of \"Borrowed Time, Two Centuries of Booms, Busts and Bailouts at Citi.\" So, James, welcome. JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR & AUTHOR: Thanks for the -- (CROSSTALK) Thank you for your patience as -- (LAUGHTER) FREEMAN: I enjoyed this process about as much as my family did. (LAUGHTER) FREEMAN: So, anyway, I appreciate it. GIGOT: That's right. You got a good product out there -- FREEMAN: Oh, thank you. GIGOT: -- a good story and good work. So 10 years after the financial panic, what's your biggest lesson? FREEMAN: Well, I think what we see when we look over this two-century history is that 2008 was not a one-off perfect storm, unexplainable, unexpected event, but it was the culmination of a century of the government standing behind Citi, and the bank going through crises, and it was such a contrast from the first century where, for 80 years roughly, it becomes the biggest bank in the country. It's an island of super ability. It's a rock that, in times of crisis, depositors come to. And there was no government standing by. GIGOT: So what happened? What changed? FREEMAN: Well, it really is the creation of the Federal Reserve. When you look at this bank that -- it was so strong before the government was standing behind it, it would actually rescue the federal government at times when it was in stress. It would rescue cities that were having trouble. GIGOT: Yes. FREEMAN: But then after -- it's almost amazing how quickly the bank deteriorated after the taxpayer safety net, the Federal Reserve, comes in. The bank starts making really disastrous loans overseas. They opened a branch in Russia in early 1917, and people can kind of imagine how -- (LAUGHTER) FREEMAN: It actually made money a few months before the Communists took it over. Pretty soon, they needed help from the government. GIGOT: That comes with that implicit - lender of last resort, for sure. FREEMAN: Right. GIGOT: Maybe implicit guarantee as well. The -- but going to 2008, do you think that Citibank could have been let fail, and would the financial system have survived? FREEMAN: I think it could have because I think that you certainly can do what the law said, which is you seize the ensured depository within this giant Citigroup financial holding company. You pay what it costs to make people whole, if there are any depositors that need money. And that certainly would have been far less than the amounts the government spent both in terms of direct investment and the exposures guaranteeing so many of Citigroup's customers. GIGOT: As some would say, hey, we pull back, so no harm no foul. FREEMAN: Yes. I should say, in the crisis of '08, it is difficult, and you can be the obviously run the experiment again. You had the government creating all of these problems across the financial landscape in terms of driving all banks into housing investment. So -- GIGOT: Making it easier to borrow, very easy to borrow. Easy guarantee, because of the government guaranty -- FREEMAN: Yes. GIGOT: -- of Freddie Mae and so on? FREEMAN: Yes. So part of what we try to do with the book is to say not just look at 2008. And what is amazing about 2008 is how little explanation, how little math, how little real analysis went into the too- big-to-fail measure. But also, how do you avoid getting to that point. How do you avoid getting to this moment where all of the regulators are -- I should say not all. Sheila Bair was a dissenting voice at the FDIC. But almost all the regulators simply take it as an article of faith that America can't live without this big bank, that it has to be saved regardless of any real analysis. GIGOT: On that point, how do you prevent us from getting there again? FREEMAN: I think this is a great time, with the economy going well, banks healthy again, making a lot of money, to start reducing that taxpayer safety net. You don't want to jar the markets. It wouldn't happen in 24 hours. It would happen over time, where you start eliminating the implicit and explicit benefits. And part of that is they created, in the Dodd-Frank law of 2010, essentially codification of the bailout scheme, where it's now clear in the law. And like before the crisis, that instead of protecting the bank and depositors and putting the holding company into bankruptcy where all failing firms ought to go, there's now a special place where too- big-to-fail banks go to get better treatment. GIGOT: Every single politician, at least Democrat politician, says too big to fail is over. Is it? FREEMAN: It's not over. It's not over. And I think -- GIGOT: They next time we get there, they'll be another big bailout of Citigroup? FREEMAN: Well, I think it's -- you look at the history, and once the federal safety net comes in -- they ran into trouble in 1920. They got federal assistance in the 1930's. They ran into trouble in late 70's with lending to Latin-American countries, a real estate crisis. You know, 2008 was not their first real estate crisis. So I think unless something changes, we are going to have to grit our teeth and watch these awful bailouts again. GIGOT: We need you writing editorials on the financial system again -- FREEMAN: Yes, sir. GIGOT: -- to block that. All right, here we go. We have to take one more back. When we come back, \"Hits & Misses\" of the week. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: Time now for \"Hits & Misses\" of the week. Kim, start us off. STRASSEL: Paul, we found this week that about five years ago, the FBI discovered a longtime staffer for Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was actually spying on her and reporting back to Chinese intelligence. It quietly and discreetly went to the Senator and she immediately dismissed to this person. So my miss here is for the FBI on the question of, yet again, why the same courtesy of a preliminary briefing was not given to Donald Trump when they had suspicions about his own campaign aides. Yet again, another reason to wonder what all was going on in this FBI investigation. GIGOT: Excellent, Kim. Thank you. Kyle? PETERSON: I'll give a miss to Hollywood, specifically west Hollywood, which, this week, the city council there passed a resolution unanimously calling for Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame to be removed. They reason for the miss is because, whatever you make of Donald Trump's politics, he is definitely a television star, having hosted \"The Apprentice\" for more than a decade. But it's probably not going to happen because the Chamber of Commerce, which actually controls the stars, says, once you are a star, always a star. Which is why even Bill Cosby is still there. GIGOT: All right, Kyle. Allysia? FINLEY: This is a miss to the Oscars. The rates have been tanking in recent years. Probably because they are way too long and most people have not seen the most-nominated movies, like \"The Shape of Water.\" Now they are condescending to the people with more taste by adding a new category for best popular film. This feels a little bit like a consolation prize for viewers. GIGOT: All right. Dan? HENNINGER: Paul, I am giving a hit to Socialism for its entertainment value. We all know about Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But then, this past weekend, Markos Moulitsas, the editor of the \"Daily Kos\" Web site, said all Democrats have to embrace Socialism or be declared irrelevant to the Democratic Party. Days later, a reporter asked Ben Jealous, the Democratic candidate for governor, whether was he would self- define as a Socialist, and he said, \"Are you kidding me?\" Welcome back, Karl Marx. GIGOT: All right. That's it for this week's show. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.

            "article_content": "Trump takes on illegal immigration at Houston rally and vows to send troops to the southern border. John Roberts reports from the White House. President Trump on Tuesday accused Democrats of possibly funding the caravan of migrants from Central America that is currently making its way through Mexico. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president offered no proof that the Democrats were funding the migrant caravan, but was reacting to an announcement by Vice President Mike Pence that the caravan was being backed by \u201cleftist organizations\u201d and \u201cVenezuela.\u201d \u201cMaybe they made a bad mistake,\u201d Trump said of the Democrats. Trump\u2019s comments came on the heels of a series of tweets that he would cut aid to three Central American countries he accused of failing to stop thousands of migrants heading for the U.S. border even as there was no indication of any other action within the administration. Trump tweeted on Monday, \"Sadly, it looks like Mexico's Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States.\" He added without evidence that \"criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in.\" Trump continued, \"Must change laws!\" Pence said on Tuesday that \u201cit is inconceivable\u201d that people from the Middle East are not in the caravan. Associated Press journalists traveling with the caravan for more than a week have spoken with Hondurans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans but said they have not met any of the \"Middle Easterners\" that Trump claimed had \"mixed in\" with the Central American migrants. It was clear, though, that more migrants were continuing to join the caravan. Trump's tweets marked the latest escalation of his efforts to thrust immigration politics into the national conversation in the closing weeks of the congressional elections. He and his senior aides have long believed the issue \u2014 which was a centerpiece of his winning presidential campaign \u2014 is key to revving up his base and motivating GOP voters to turn out in November. \"Blame the Democrats,\" he wrote. \"Remember the midterms.\" LAURA INGRAHAM: MOBILE MOB HIGHLIGHTS DEMOCRATS' TONE DEAFNESS The three countries received about $500 million from the U.S. in fiscal year 2017. That money funds programs that promote economic development and education, as well as supporting democracy and human rights, among other issues. It was not immediately clear how much money Trump now hopes to cut, though the administration already had been pushing to reduce the government's global aid and foreign operations budget by about 30 percent for fiscal 2019 that began Oct 1. Paul O'Brien, the vice president for policy and advocacy at Oxfam America, said that any attempts to decrease aid to the Central American countries would be \"devastating\" since the U.S. is a key investor in the region, funding programs on issues ranging from workforce development to reducing violence and improving human rights. In addition, other investors look to the U.S. as a guide. \"If you take that money away or you make it unpredictable, you're actually going to foster the very conditions that are driving people toward migration,\" said O'Brien, who accused Trump of \"essentially seeking to use migrants as a political chip.\" Trump on Tuesday acknowledged that there was \u201cheartache on both sides,\u201d but said that work to improve the human rights conditions in Central America \u201chasn\u2019t worked for a long time.\u201d The president added that the U.S. needed to implement a merit-based immigration system. VIDEO: MIGRANT CARAVAN BATTLING BLISTERING TEMPERATURES \u201cWe cannot allow our country to be violated like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to focus on our country for a change.\u201d Trump addressed several other topics in the Oval Office. He criticized Saudi Arabia's response after the apparent death of writer and activist Jamal Khashoggi, calling it one of the \"worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\"\nHe also said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, would unveil a middle-income tax cut plan in the coming days.

            "article_content": "The president is reaching a high-water mark in his presidency, with his support growing and expanding. Happy Fourth of July! After 15 years of lethargic growth, the American economy is finally putting up respectable numbers again. Remember hard left New York Times columnist Paul Krugman predicting the apocalypse in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election? Well, the data are piling in. Corporate taxes have been cut to internationally competitive levels. Middle class folks are paying less, and deregulation well underway. The result? Businesses are more confident and investing again, consumers are confident and spending again, and the U.S economy is poised for its first 3 percent growth year since 2005. Over in Europe, where statism and policies more to Mr. Krugman\u2019s liking prevail, the recovery is once again flagging. Still, skeptics abound among economists whose analysis is more influenced by political biases rather than allegiance to what economic research has taught us about taxes and investment. Many see another recession looming and they argue the economy is only getting a temporary jolt from tax cuts. After that, they pontificate, aggregate demand will tail off. Well, nonpartisan econometric studies predating the Trump candidacy indicate the contrary \u2013 showing that the 15 percent cut in taxes on business profits enabled by corporate reforms should increase investment between 7.5 percent and 15 percent every year going forward. And in the current environment of deregulation, that higher figure should be the one to more closely apply. Look for all of this to continue to boost growth in 2019, given that something bad does not happen. There is a resiliency about Americans when the government gets out of the way. Bank on that. In the near term, little danger of overheating is apparent. Unemployment is down to 3.8 percent and wages are rising in line with productivity growth and the Fed\u2019s 2 percent inflation target. Add to that a healthy number of job recruits are available (many of whom became discouraged during the Obama years), a stronger dollar keeping competitive imports inexpensive, and robotics and artificial intelligence kicking in. Consumers generally take a breather during the winter months, because the financial crisis taught them caution. Households have a good time shopping for the holidays and then pay down their bills in the first quarter\u2014hence the tax cut only recently boosted consumer spending. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, unlike most professional economists, does not let what personal feelings he has towards politicians cloud his thinking. If the numbers continue to show core inflation in-line with his target, he will recognize the Fed can do little but wreak havoc by boosting interest rates too quickly or too much. And investors are betting on the U.S. economy over more statist regimes in Europe and China. U.S. stocks and bonds now account for nearly 60 percent of global investment portfolios, even though the U.S. economy\u2014though the largest\u2014accounts for less than one-fifth of global GDP. The dollar has become even more dominant globally, compelling businesses and governments to borrow greenbacks rather than local currency. Overly aggressive Fed tightening could create crises for many of those debtors\u2014look at Argentina\u2019s recent begging at the door of the International Monetary Fund. That\u2019s another reason to believe Fed Chairman Powell will move cautiously with raising interest rates and slowing the U.S. recovery. As for a trade war, economists can\u2019t seem to get over the fact that free trade did not work out for a vast swath of interior America. The Chinese hardly play by free-trade rules. And yes, a poorly conceived American response to China\u2019s aggressive mercantilism could be damaging \u2013 but doing nothing could be even worse. Look at the corrosive consequences of trade-driven unemployment, social decay and opioid addiction in America\u2019s rural communities and small cities. The trick is to penalize China in ways that make retaliation difficult\u2014and that can be done. Unfortunately, there are too few outsiders who Trump\u2019s trade team is willing to seriously consider constructive criticism from, due in large part to the fact they are too busy quarreling among themselves. And Treasury seems to show no alarm about the long-term debt consequences of huge trade deficits. But, administrations that don\u2019t listen are nothing new. Barack Obama was in constant broadcast mode, and his economists could never be accused of having open minds. There is a resiliency about Americans when the government gets out of the way. Bank on that. And for now, sound domestic policies\u2014tax cuts, deregulation and prudent Fed policies \u2013 will clear a path for the creativity of the American people. This Fourth of July let\u2019s celebrate. America is back thanks to President Trump.",

            "article_content": "The Ohio governor's race between Democrat Richard Cordray, left, and Republican Mike DeWine, right, is tight with just weeks until the midterms. (Cordray/DeWine campaigns) Ohio\u2019s economy is strong after eight years of Republican rule in a state that went decisively for the GOP two years ago, while the Democratic candidate for governor faces a new dust-up over unusual ties to a politically connected ad firm. Still, the governor\u2019s race in Ohio between Republican Mike DeWine and Democrat Richard Cordray is tight in what has historically been one of the hottest presidential battlegrounds in the country \u2013 going twice for George W. Bush, twice for Barack Obama and decisively for Donald Trump. Though polling hasn\u2019t happened since June, the Real Clear Politics average gives Cordray, the former director of the controversial Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a 1.6 percent advantage over DeWine, the state attorney general and former U.S. senator. Fox News Power Rankings and Inside Elections give DeWine a slight edge, while the Cook Political Report and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball call the contest a toss-up. The race is a rematch from the 2010 attorney general\u2019s race, in which DeWine defeated the incumbent Cordray. Obama even\u00a0stumped last Thursday in Cleveland for the man he appointed to run the CFPB. \u201cRich was one of the first people to ever endorse my candidacy for president,\u201d Obama said of Cordray. \u201cHe had my back when some of you probably couldn't even pronounce my name, and if you elect him, you'll have a governor who will have your back every single day.\u201d On the same night, Donald Trump Jr. was the featured speaker at a private fundraiser for DeWine in Salem, Ohio. Cordray tapped former U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton to be his lieutenant governor if victorious, while the Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted is running for the number two spot under DeWine. Husted said he\u2019s not surprised the race is close, but believes voters realize how Ohio has changed since the days of Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, who served when Cordray was the state\u2019s attorney general and treasurer. \u201cOpen seats in Ohio are always competitive, but a majority of Ohioans feel we are headed in the right direction,\u201d Husted told Fox News. \u201cUnemployment is almost at record lows \u2026 Under Cordray-Strickland, employers were laying people off. Now employers have so many jobs, they can\u2019t find enough people to fill them.\u201d However, the state\u2019s GOP faces a rift between Trump and two-term Gov. John Kasich that never quite healed after the 2016 Republican presidential primary. \u201cWe try to earn the support of everyone and welcome the support of both the president and the governor,\u201d Husted added. \u201cElecting Mike DeWine as governor is one of the few things the president and the governor agree on.\u201d The Trump-Kasich divide doesn\u2019t help the GOP, which needs a unified party in a competitive race, said Nathaniel Swigger, a political science professor at Ohio State University. \u201cKasich is still relatively popular with independents but they can\u2019t talk about him,\u201d Swigger told Fox News. \u201cIf they try to mobilize the Trump voters, they risk demobilizing Kasich voters. If they try to mobilize the Kasich voters, they risk demobilizing the Trump voters.\u201d DeWine looks to cap off his resume after serving in the state legislature, representing the state in the U.S. House, serving as lieutenant governor and then two terms in the U.S. Senate. He lost to Democrat Sherrod Brown during the 2006 Democratic wave. Cordray was elected as state treasurer in 2006, then won a special election in 2008 to become the state attorney general. He lost to DeWine in 2010. Obama named him to head the CFPB in 2012, where he served until late 2017. Although Republicans are suspicious of the consumer bureau because of its expansive power, Cordray has sought to use the issue to his advantage. \"This week 10 years ago, a financial crisis crushed Ohioans who lost jobs and homes,\" Cordray tweeted Tuesday. \"My opponent\u2019s votes let Wall Street run wild and take advantage of people on Main Street. Now he blames me! I went to work and cleaned up the mess he and his allies made.\" Hours before the Obama rally Thursday, the Associated Press reported Cordray\u2019s gubernatorial campaign hired the Washington-based GMMB advertising company\u2014the same firm the CFPB contracted with under Cordray. The consumer bureau\u2019s inspector general found in June the contract from August 2013 to February 2018 was estimated to cost taxpayers $11 million and ballooned to $43.8 million because of poor management. Ohio Republicans alleged cronyism for a company that was also the lead ad agency for both of Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns. The Cordray campaign responded there was nothing improper about the firm\u2019s work for either the CFPB or the campaign. \"Rich Cordray is proud of the work he did at the CFPB to take on predatory lenders and put $12 billion back into the pockets of 30 million Americans who had been cheated or mistreated,\" Cordray spokesman Mike Gwin told the Associated Press. \"It's unsurprising that those same powerful interests are now using bogus and debunked smears to try to misrepresent Rich's record of standing up for middle class families.\" Still, Swigger of Ohio State University doubts the average voter is too concerned with the CFPB. \u201cThere is no data on how voters feel about the CFPB. It\u2019s a little inside baseball,\u201d Swigger said. \u201cI would be surprised if a majority of Ohio voters even know what Richard Cordray\u2019s last job was.\u201d Fred Lucas is the White House correspondent for the Daily Signal.",

            "article_content": "DOJ releases over 400 pages of FISA documents concerning former Trump campaign aide Carter Page; Rep. Bob Goodlatte shares insight on 'Sunday Morning Futures.' This is a rush transcript from \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" July 22, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning. Good Sunday morning. We are getting a first look at top-secret surveillance records this morning showing how the FBI spied on a former member of the Trump campaign. And now the president is weighing in this morning. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin makes clear one of his obsessions during that joint press conference with President Trump. And what is the strategy for House Republicans to keep control of the House, as we witness a rising interest in Democratic socialism ahead of the midterm elections? Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining me. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" President Trump responds this morning to the Justice Department releasing more than 400 pages of documents related to the 2016 FISA application for former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. It shows the intimate Steele dossier was, in fact, a major component for the surveillance warrant. Fresh reaction from House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Alan Dershowitz coming up this morning. Vladimir Putin called him out by the name during the Helsinki news conference by President Trump. Today, Bill Browder responds to the Russian leader. He will join me live. And the midterm race is heating up. I'll speak exclusively with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise about the Republican leadership's strategy to keep control of the House. All that and a lot more right now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And top of the news right now, the Justice Department is making its first public disclosure of a highly sensitive FISA request by releasing the heavily redacted version of the documents relating to that FISA warrant against former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. The 400-plus pages were released as a result of lawsuits filed by several media organizations, including Judicial Watch. The documents reveal major components in the FBI surveillance request leading up to the 2016 presidential election. They were memos written by Christopher Steele. That is what they used to get the warrant, the former British intelligence officer hired by a research firm working for Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton. The president reacting on Twitter earlier this morning, saying: \"Congratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents. As usual, they are ridiculously heavily redacted, but confirm with little doubt that the Department of Justice and the FBI misled the courts. Witch-hunt. Rigged. A scam.\" The president later tweeted this: \"Looking more and more like the Trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon, surveillance for the political gain of crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out? She did better with crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal scam.\" Joining me right now with his first reaction to all of this is House Judiciary Committee Chairman and Virginia Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte. Mr. Chairman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VIRGINIA: Good morning, Maria. It's good to be with you. BARTIROMO: Well, what strikes me about all of these documents that I have been looking at all morning is all of the redactions on every page, major black, black lines redacted. So, tell us, what did we learn from this FISA warrant? GOODLATTE: Well, we certainly learned that there is a serious problem with the FBI presenting to the FISA court an application for a search warrant against a United States citizen and then followed by three renewals when they were basing it on a very flawed document, the so-called Steele dossier, that has never been verified. Even after all of this came out, they attempted to verify it and failed. So that's number one. Number two, I have had the opportunity, as have a few other members of the House of Representatives, the opportunity to read these FISA warrant applications without all of those redactions. There are only a few redactions in the document that I reviewed. And I think it is critically important that the American people have the opportunity to see most of the rest of those documents. We want to make sure that we're protecting sources. We want to make sure that we're protecting methods that are used in investigations. But most of the information that is redacted in that report should easily be seen by the American people. They can judge for themselves, but I will tell you, it doesn't support the issuance of a warrant against Mr. Page. BARTIROMO: So, what will be done about it? GOODLATTE: Well, certainly, this is a big development for the investigation that I, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Trey Gowdy, as chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, have been pursuing now for the last nine months, because, as you know, at each step in that process, the FBI has objected to our looking into this matter, because they claim it's part of an ongoing investigation. And we have said all along we're not interested in looking at the substance of anything that Mr. Mueller does find in his investigation. We don't want to interfere with that. But we do want to see how this investigation was launched and how it contrasts with the shocking way that they handled the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. So that is an absolutely critical aspect of this. And now we have a federal judge who agrees that information regarding that investigation can and should be made public and has ordered it be made public. Much more needs to be done in that regard. But the Congress, which has subpoena power and has issued subpoenas with regard to both documents and witnesses, is entitled to have answers to our questions. And I think that this is a major boost to that effort. BARTIROMO: There was one redaction here about an agent, an agent launching this investigation. Are we assuming that that is Peter Strzok, who is also-- his name redacted in this warrant? GOODLATTE: I can't comment on the redacted items in that until a court has ordered them to be made public. But I can say that, based upon our other aspects of this investigation, that Peter Strzok was at the heart of both the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation, where the FBI bent over backwards to find every way possible to not proceed with that case. And, in fact, as you know, they did decide in a very public and controversial way not to proceed in that investigation. And he was also at the heart of the beginning of this investigation into so-called Trump campaign-Russia collusion. BARTIROMO: I want to know what this tells us about the Robert Mueller probe, because you go back to Carter Page, and here is the guy who was actually wiretapped and surveilled. If Carter Page was an agent of a foreign power working for the Russians, why is he still running around free? Why are there no charges against Carter Page? And, by the way, what does that say about Comey, McCabe, Yates, Rosenstein, and the others who repeatedly certified to the court that he was, that he was an agent of foreign power? Why has he not been charged then? GOODLATTE: Well, excellent question. He was surveilled for a solid year, three-month increments for -- with three renewals. And I don't believe they found anything with regard to him. I cannot speak for him, and I can't speak for special counsel Mueller. And, as I have said before, he has been charged with a responsibility to carry out. And if he finds evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, he should bring it forward. This investigation is now more than 2 years old. And it is, I think, very -- he's only been on the job for a little over a year. But this was going on for almost a year before he came on the scene, and still is a cloud, a shadow over this administration. It is something that, if they have the goods, as Chairman Gowdy has said, bring them to a grand jury. If you don't, let's let the world know that they don't have that evidence. BARTIROMO: I want to run for you what Senator Rand Paul said on Fox News this past week, because I'm wondering if this information and all that we're gleaning from all of this, whether it's the FISA warrant or your interactions with Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, which I'm going to get to, if that is going to dictate where the Robert Mueller investigation goes. You would think that it would, since his mandate is collusion with the Russians. Here is what Senator Rand Paul said about all of this, this week on Fox News. Listen to this, Mr. Chairman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: The president sees the Mueller investigation, he sees all these accusations from partisan Democrats, Hillary Clinton, saying, oh, he colluded with the Russians, but then he also sees that the only people who actually we know colluded with the Russians were Hillary Clinton, who paid a British agent, who then paid Russians for information with this dossier. So he is -- feels like the intelligence community cooked up a political or partisan investigation. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: Would Robert Mueller interview Hillary Clinton? GOODLATTE: Well, again, I can't speak for Robert Mueller. But I can very heartily agree with Senator Paul when he says that Democratic operatives related to the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the creation of the so-called Steele dossier, and then turned it over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But what's so unprecedented about this is that the FBI then took it, weaponized it, without ever verifying its credibility, and brought it to the FISA court without disclosing the source of that information. That is deeply troubling. And it is a part of the reason why the new FBI director has been hard at work trying to reform this organization, whose credibility has been damaged by a few key people. And, by the way, those few key people are the same people in both of these investigations, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, the FBI counsel, the chief of staff to the director, the same people in both these investigations. BARTIROMO: Yes. GOODLATTE: In one instance doing everything possible to avoid indicting Hillary Clinton, including allowing her chief aides to be in the room with her when she was interviewed by the FBI, creating a memo exonerating her before most of the witnesses, including Secretary Clinton, had been interviewed, not putting this before a grand jury, even though they had impaneled a grand jury in that investigation. They didn't let the grand jury determine whether she should be indicted, and then changing the language in the memo from gross negligence to extreme carelessness. Gross negligence very closely tracks the statute. Extreme carelessness is not a meaningful phrase. All to avoid indicting her. BARTIROMO: Yes. GOODLATTE: That is shocking. BARTIROMO: And many of the people that you mentioned, they have signed -- on the signage page of this FISA warrant, they all signed it, OKing it, and that includes John Brennan -- Sally Yates, John Brennan, Jim Comey, Peter Strzok. So, John Brennan, he's the man who deserves a belated bit of scrutiny, according to The Wall Street Journal, Kim Strassel's op-ed just this past week. We know that John Brennan has been all over town trashing President Trump and trashing the hearing that your committee actually did with Peter Strzok. What are your thoughts on John Brennan's involvement? GOODLATTE: Well, we have lots of questions for John Brennan, and he will definitely be sought by the committees for an interview. This is an extremely disturbing thing to see both he and James Comey, supposedly impartial government officials carrying out their jobs in very important areas in intelligence-gathering and law enforcement, express the kind of extreme bias that they have shown now, which I think reflects quite accurately on what they were doing back in 2016. BARTIROMO: So, he's on your list of witnesses to have in to interview them? GOODLATTE: Absolutely. Definitely. BARTIROMO: Who else is on that list? GOODLATTE: Well, we're going to go through -- we have received a list from the Intelligence Committee of literally dozens of people. We're going through that list now and determining which ones are our priority. I think I would rather leave it at that, but certainly we will also be talking to Director Comey and former Attorney General Lynch. BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about Lisa Page. I know that you had behind-closed-door meetings with her, but, apparently, during that hearing, you have discovered more information that you want. Can you tell us anything about the Lisa Page testimony and what you learned? GOODLATTE: Well, it was a private confidential interview. But I will say this, that Ms. Page, in contrast to Mr. Strzok, was far more forthcoming and gave us far more information regarding what was going on in 2016 and into 2017, to help our investigation. But I will also say that she reminded us of some documents that hadn't been talked about for a while, including the fact that there are not only memos by James Comey that we're all aware of, but also memos by Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI, that are of interest to us as well, and we're seeking those now. BARTIROMO: So now you're seeking those documents. I know that you have been focused and certainly your colleague Devin Nunes has been focused on any information before the actual investigation was launched, which was July 31, 2016. Mr. Chairman, I want to take a short break, and then I want to come back to that. We also have much to discuss with you, including that showdown with Democrats over a House resolution to support ICE. We will be right back with Chairman Goodlatte. Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures. Let us know what you would like to hear from Chairman Goodlatte. And a quick programming note: Former Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Joe Lieberman will join me this Wednesday on \"Mornings With Maria\" on the Fox Business Network. So join me weekdays at 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern on Fox Business. We will be right back with Chairman Goodlatte. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: We're back with House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte. And, Mr. Chairman, we know, based on the copies of the FISA warrant that we were able to look at today, that Rod Rosenstein, the deputy A.G., signed off on the FISA warrant. And they signed off three additional times, so a total of four times, with the same evidence. Are you among those calling for Rod Rosenstein to recuse himself? GOODLATTE: I am not at this point. Rod Rosenstein did sign the third renewal application or, in other words, the last FISA warrant application. He was asked at the hearing that he testified at a couple weeks ago whether or not he read the document. He declined to answer that because he claimed it was part of an ongoing investigation. I think that's an important question that he needs to answer, but I also think it's even more important that he continue to work with the Congress to move this forward, so that we can get answers to all of our questions and get all of the documents that we have subpoenaed. There has been definitely more cooperation since we issued the subpoena and since U.S. attorney John Lausch from the Northern District of Illinois was appointed to help us get those documents. We have much greater access to unredacted documents than we have had before. But we still have a long way to go. This is an ongoing investigation, and there are many more documents and many more questions that witnesses have been instructed by the FBI not to answer that need to be answered. And I think the fact that a judge has now ordered the release of this FISA warrant application shows that it is entirely appropriate for us to look into how this investigation was launched. BARTIROMO: Yes. And, of course, that investigation morphed into the Robert Mueller investigation. And there was one text from Peter Strzok to Lisa Page that basically says there's no there there when the Robert Mueller investigation launched, correct? GOODLATTE: That's correct. BARTIROMO: Yes. OK, we will keep following that. Let me move on to immigration. You have been working, obviously, with two bills. Are you going to be able to get one of them across the finish line before the midterm elections? What are your expectations there, Mr. Chairman? GOODLATTE: Well, you know, Maria, 224 House Republicans, all but 12 of the Republicans in the House, have voted for one of the two measures that we offered. Unfortunately, neither one got to 218. One got to 193, just 21 votes short of what is a current -- what -- the majority that day. BARTIROMO: Right. GOODLATTE: And there are many members hard at work trying to make sure that we bring some of the measures from the second one into the first one and get over 218 votes. That would be huge. BARTIROMO: OK. Well, we will wait for that. And real quick, I know you had some technology executives in a hearing as well. You're looking at the editing of information, conservative ideas. Tell us what you're looking at in terms of technology CEOs and where you are in that regard. Real quick, sir. GOODLATTE: Well, we held a hearing last week with representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter, in the case of Google, particularly YouTube, regarding their censorship policies, which they do on all three of those social media platforms. BARTIROMO: Right. GOODLATTE: And we have had the opportunity to ask some very probing questions about how it is that they have liability protections that newspaper or television... BARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman, we're going to be looking at this. GOODLATTE: OK. BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Good to see you, sir, Chairman Goodlatte. GOODLATTE: Thank you, Maria. BARTIROMO: We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Senate voting unanimously on a nonbinding resolution to oppose giving Russia access to U.S. officials. Vladimir Putin making the proposal in exchange for allowing special counsel Robert Mueller access to the 12 Russians indicted by the Justice Department. Putin made the suggestion during that Helsinki news conference with President Trump, calling out my next guest by name. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr. Mueller, we can let them into the country and they will be present for this questioning. Then we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate, and so we can bring up Mr. Browder in this particular case. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO: \"Bring up Mr. Browder in this particular case.\" Joining us right now is the man, Bill Browder. He is the CEO of Hermitage Capital Management and a thorn in Putin's side now for several years. Bill, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. BILL BROWDER, CEO, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Great to be here. BARTIROMO: Look, I know you a lot of years, Bill. And we have talked about your story for a lot of years. But, even then, for me, after knowing the story as well as I do, I got chills down my back when I heard Vladimir Putin mention your name. What did you think? BROWDER: Well, I should point out that he's been mentioning my name on a regular basis for the last six years. In fact, I would go so far as to say that Vladimir Putin is obsessed with me. He's obsessed because I was the one responsible for getting the Magnitsky Act passed in 2012, which sanctions Putin and his corrupt cronies for human rights violations. And he hates that. BARTIROMO: So, tell us about that, because just to briefly go through your story, at one point, you were the leading -- one of the leading investors in Russia. You owned a lot of Russian companies, Russian stocks in your Hermitage Capital fund. You were living between Moscow and London. You were traveling back and forth all the time, when you were -- became aware of corruption going on, oligarchs stealing money from Russian companies. You wanted it stopped. You started to become more of an active investor, calling out this. And then what happened, Bill? BROWDER: Well, so after exposing corruption in these big companies like Gazprom, Putin expelled me from the country, declared me as a threat to national security. The police then raided my offices in Moscow, seized all my documents. I had a young lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky start to investigate. And he figured out that they seized those documents to steal $230 million of taxes that we paid to the Russian government. He exposed it. He was then arrested by some of the people he exposed, put in pretrial detention, tortured for 358 days, and then killed at the age of 37 in a Russian prison on November 16, 2009. BARTIROMO: Wow. BROWDER: And, since then, I have put aside everything else I'm doing on a mission to get justice for Sergei Magnitsky, which has resulted in the Magnitsky Act, which Putin hates me so much for. BARTIROMO: And the Magnitsky Act basically protects companies and punishes those who try to have fraud and stealing of the wealth by the oligarchs. And Putin is upset by that. Let's show you -- the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote a piece about you this weekend, saying, Donald Trump, meet Bill Browder. It begins like this: \"Vladimir Putin knows what he wants from Donald Trump. And one priority is help in silencing businessman and human rights advocate Bill Browder. Someone should tell Mr. Trump that he and Mr. Browder were both targeted by Fusion GPS, the political gun for hire that midwifed the Steele dossier in 2016.\" Tell us what happened with you and Fusion GPS, Bill. BROWDER: So, just a little bit of background on the story. So, the Department of Justice discovered that there was some of the money from the Magnitsky case in New York. They opened up a criminal case against a Russian oligarch. And Fusion GPS came in to work for the Russian oligarch for Natalia Veselnitskaya, who is the Russian oligarch's lawyer. So, Fusion GPS, the firm that did the Trump dossier, started to do a smear campaign on me. And they put together all of Natalia Veselnitskaya's talking points about me for the Trump Tower meeting where she went into speak with Donald Trump Jr. And I would deduce that Fusion GPS and Glenn Simpson, therefore, put together the same talking points for Vladimir Putin, because they were the same talking points in Trump Tower. So, in that Helsinki meeting last week, Vladimir Putin said a whole bunch of stuff about me. And, as far as I can tell, I think that those talking points came from Glenn Simpson. BARTIROMO: Well the Senate voted down any idea that the Russians would be able to question you. And Donald Trump obviously agreed with that, so that's not happening. But I have seen some of your quotes in the press. You're afraid that, if in fact that were to happen, you're a dead man. BROWDER: Well, basically, even if there's only a 1 percent chance of it happening, if I get handed over to the Russians and to Vladimir Putin, I will be killed. There's no question about it. They have made death threats on a number of occasions. A number of other people connected to this case have either been killed or attempted to be killed. Vladimir Putin wants me dead. This is not -- this is not -- this is a very serious matter. BARTIROMO: Now, the charges that he levels against you, which were all debunked, we should say, but he says you avoided taxes in Russia and in the U.S. and that you gave hundreds of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton. Your reaction? BROWDER: Well, all -- he's been throwing out charges against me like candy. These particular charges have been analyzed by the U.S. Department of Justice, by the British government, by Interpol, by the German government, and have all been rejected outright. It's just complete nonsense. In terms of the Hillary Clinton campaign contributions, I have given zero, zero contributions to Hillary Clinton in any campaign. I do not make U.S. campaign contributions. And, in fact, this $400 million number that he threw out, they then walked back to $400,000 the next day. And the real number is zero. BARTIROMO: It's an interesting situation, because when you look at the past in terms of Vladimir Putin, there's your story. There's Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Garry Kasparov, the chess champion, was thrown in jail, not to mention the endless number of murders of journalists in Russia and enemies of Putin. Then again, Russia and the U.S. control 90 percent of the world's nuclear capability. What does President Trump do? He has to work with the other partner of the nuclear capability, no? But it's important to put a picture together of who Vladimir Putin is. BROWDER: Well, I think that President Trump should do what Ronald Reagan did. I mean, Russia and the Soviet Union have had these nuclear warheads for a long time. Ronald Reagan knew what to do, which was to contain the Soviet Union. And Donald Trump should contain Russia. This is not -- you don't make friends and buddy-buddy up to a hostile, malign power. And that's what that 98-0 vote was about and every other vote in Congress about Russia. This is not a partisan thing. This is a -- it's un-American to do anything other than contain Vladimir Putin. And I think... BARTIROMO: It feels, at this point, we are seeing a new era. And it seems that the president understands who this person is. But we will keep watching that. Bill Browder, it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks very much. And we're not saying where you're coming to us from. We understand the danger you're in. Next up, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Republicans are working on their strategy to retain control of Congress come November amid talk of a blue wave in the upcoming midterms. My next guest has some insight on the plan for the GOP lawmakers in the House. With me now in an exclusive interview is House Majority Whip and Republican Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise. Congressman, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA, HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: Morning. Always great to be with you, Maria. BARTIROMO: So, what is the plan to retain control of the House, from your standpoint? SCALISE: The plan is to continue focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth, and then locking it in. We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes. We're going to make the tax cuts permanent. That bill, Chairman Brady and his committee are already working on. We just did a jobs 3.0 bill, a bill to provide more regulatory relief, and do some more things that will help create more jobs and rebuild the middle class. And, look, it's a stark contrast with the radical left's agenda right now in Washington. Pelosi is talking about raising taxes. She's talking about abolishing ICE, single-payer health care. That's not the direction we need to go. So let's keep the economy moving. We're going to continue focusing on it. This week, we're going to bring a bill to repeal the medical device tax, push back the health insurance taxes, the HIT tax, some of these things that are hurting health care in this country, and let's focus on getting the economy moving. BARTIROMO: And, by the way, the economy is going to show movement this week. We get the GDP number out on Thursday, and all expectations call for a second-quarter GDP number of 4 percent, largely as a result of some of the rollback in regulations and the tax cut plan. I want to talk about what the Democrats, though, are going to do in response to that. Joe Lieberman, a former senator, wrote an op-ed. And Lieberman writes this in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal this week, \"Vote Joe Crowley for working families.\" It begins with this quote: \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's surprise victory over Representative Joe Crowley seems likely to hurt Congress, America, and the Democratic Party. It doesn't have to.\" What Lieberman writes is that he's hoping that Crowley's name is on the ballot, because the idea to abolish ICE came from her, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez. And Tom Perez, the head of the DNC, says she's the future of the party. SCALISE: Well, I hope she is, because it shows such a dramatic shift to the radical left. That's not where America is. America is still a center-right country. And you saw she was out there with Bernie Sanders going through the Midwest, going to Missouri. She was in Kansas City. They're trying to push this idea of abolishing ICE, of all things. Think about this, Maria. The very people who keep our country safe -- ICE has been directly responsible for stopping human trafficking, stopping -- saving some of these kids that are being exploited from human trafficking. And they want to get rid of them. They want open borders. That's not what this country is all about. I hope they keep going around and letting people know that's what they would do if they were in the majority. BARTIROMO: I don't understand the idea of open borders. It's really questionable in terms of that being a platform to run on. In terms of immigration and your efforts, we just heard from Bob Goodlatte. Are you going to be able to come up with a plan that protects the DACA recipients, but also protects this country with the proper security in terms of securing the borders? SCALISE: Well, Maria, we have had two different bills we have brought to the floor that would do just that. And, as you heard Chairman Goodlatte say, we have had large numbers of Republicans vote for it, but not one Democrat. So when you have between the two bills 224 Republicans voting yes to build a wall, secure the border, solve the DACA problem and the visa lottery system, and not one Democrat could find a way to vote for any of those bills, it shows you they don't want to solve this problem and we do. We will keep working on it, but let's -- let's look at those votes, Maria, to show there are serious Republican plans to secure this country's border. And every single Democrat voted no because Nancy Pelosi bullied them and threatened them and said she didn't want to provide Donald Trump with a win. That's not -- again, that's not what this country is all about. Some of the great things President Trump has done, working with us to cut taxes, to get the economy moving, to bring regulations under control, it's actually working. They should want to join with us to keep that going. To be opposed to the things that are helping rebuild our middle class is a losing strategy for Democrats. BARTIROMO: And in a -- also foreign policy, you look at some of the outcomes that have come, Jim Mattis apparently saying that the NATO meeting was among the most successful meetings that he's ever seen. Your thoughts on the president's relationship with Vladimir Putin and what the U.S. needs to do with Russia, given these horrible stories we just heard about Putin from Bill Browder. SCALISE: Yes, Putin is a bad guy. He's not our friend. I think what you have got to look at are the actions that President Trump has taken to stand up against Putin and to stand up against Russia. And they're significant, Maria. If you start with the Ukraine, they're our friend in Eastern Europe. You saw Putin rolling through Crimea, moving into Eastern Europe. And Barack Obama sat on the sidelines. Those countries -- by the way, the Ukrainians, they didn't say, give us boots on the ground. They said, can you just sell us arms, so we can push back against the Russians' aggression and bomb their tanks? And Obama said no. President Trump said yes and actually sold them those missiles, so that they can defend their country and push Russia out of Eastern Europe. BARTIROMO: Yes. SCALISE: And that's happening right now. He kicked out diplomats. He increased sanctions against Russia. That's standing up to Russia. We need to keep reminding Russia they're not our friend. They need to get out of Syria. They need stop allying with some of these rogue countries. BARTIROMO: Kevin Brady was on this program last week, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. He said he was going to get -- try to get a vote on tax cuts 2.0 to the floor in September. Do you think he will need Democratic support here? Is anybody going to vote for tax cuts 2.0, when they're complaining about deficits, and they didn't vote for tax cuts 1? SCALISE: Every single Democrat should vote for tax cuts 2.0. BARTIROMO: But they won't. SCALISE: Because it's worked for our economy. But they probably won't, Maria. And, look, we're going to go forward anyway. What Chairman Brady is doing, I think, is important work. He was down at the White House just a few days ago working with President Trump to make sure that the cuts include all the things we want to do to keep this economy growing. BARTIROMO: All right. SCALISE: We're seeing historic growth. Let's keep it going. We are going to have a bill on the floor to do just that in September. And it'll pass the House. The real question is, will every Democrat vote no, like they did last time, now knowing how well it's working for middle-class families? BARTIROMO: It's a win for President Trump, for sure. Congressman, it's good to see you. Thanks so much. SCALISE: Great being back with you, Maria. BARTIROMO: We appreciate you joining us, Congressman Steve Scalise there. The Department of Justice released heavily redacted documents last night relating to the surveillance warrant against a former Trump campaign aid. So what, if anything, do these documents tell us? Alan Dershowitz weighs in next, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Back to our top story today. The Justice Department released top-secret documents on the FISA warrant sought for the Trump campaign aide Carter Page. The release of the heavily redacted 412-page report comes in response to several freedom of information lawsuits. It shows the FBI relied on the discredited Steele dossier as a major component to apply for surveillance warrants on Carter Page. For his part, Page is maintaining his innocence. My next guest is the author of the new book \"The Case against Impeaching Trump.\" Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz joins me right now. And, Alan, it's good to see you this morning. Your reaction to what we have received in terms of this FISA warrant, which is heavily redacted, every page, massive black spots? What do you think? ALAN DERSHOWITZ, ATTORNEY: Well, I'm used to seeing redacted information. I would say 90 percent of redactions are generally designed to cover people's incompetence, and they're not national security. And I think you should have an objective, neutral person go through the redactions and always err in favor of publicly releasing and transparency, rather than secrecy. But what it also shows us is that there is potentially a violation of the United States Supreme Court decision called Franks vs. Maryland and its progeny. That case says, when you make an application for a warrant, you have to be truthful. And if you omit important information or fail to disclose information that might discredit the source, there's a real legal problem. And here, of course, we know that the Steele dossier, we know how it was obtained, we know the circumstances. And the FISA court didn't know those pieces of information, should have known it. And the question really is, was there other information sufficient beyond the Steele dossier to justify intruding on the privacy rights of an American citizen? BARTIROMO: That's right. DERSHOWITZ: And we don't know enough yet to answer that question. BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, we know that one other piece of information used was a Yahoo article about the Steele dossier. So it was all based on the Steele dossier. DERSHOWITZ: Yes. BARTIROMO: And then they re-upped it and got -- they had to get additional sign-offs on it three times with the same information. Normally, you -- when you go to re-up a warrant, you have new informational. It's based on the dossier. Look, is it high time we all admit that the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign because it was a political enemy and there was an election? DERSHOWITZ: Well, I would like to know more about that. That's why right from day one I called for an independent, nonpartisan, expert investigating commission that would look at the entire 2016 election, ranging from Comey's statements to Strzok to whether the Obama administration put a spy in the campaign. All of these things are relevant to all Americans. And they're nonpartisan. We want to see fair elections. We don't want to see the thumb of any FBI agents, Justice Department officials, Russia, Comey, we don't want to see the come, even a pinkie on the scale of our election. And we're not learning this from the Mueller report. BARTIROMO: So, what happens now, Alan? DERSHOWITZ: Yes. BARTIROMO: It certainly doesn't feel good. It feels like it's rigged, this whole thing. What happens now when you're -- in your estimation, based on what we know from Peter Strzok, what we know about the hearings in terms of Lisa Page, and, of course, all of these texts? DERSHOWITZ: Well, we will see, first of all, whether any of this appears in Mueller's report, because there's going to be a report. But there are also indictments and there will be some contested cases. And in the contested cases, lawyers have a gold mine to work with, defense lawyers, challenging this FISA application, challenging Strzok's objectivity. All of this will become a basis for legal proceedings and legal challenges. We have already seen Judge Ellis in Virginia question the special counsel, wonder whether, not only are they trying to make people sing, but also make them compose. The process is a very flawed one. And the more the American people know about it, the more distressed they are at how special counsels operate, particularly in the context of political elections. We need to know more, not less. We need less redaction, more transparency. And we have the right to judge for ourselves whether our system of justice is operating fairly, within the Constitution, and consistent with civil liberties. Right now, there are questions, more questions than answers. BARTIROMO: There sure are. All right, we are going to keep watching that and wonder when the Robert Mueller report will be out. We're waiting on that, of course. Good to see you, Alan. Thanks very much for weighing in this morning. DERSHOWITZ: Oh, thank you so much. BARTIROMO: Alan Dershowitz joining us. We will be right back with our all-star panel on all of that. Back in a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Justice Department releasing the Carter Page FISA documents. Let's bring in our panel on that. Ed Rollins is a former Reagan-Bush campaign manager. James Freeman is an assistant editor for The Wall Street Journal editorial page. Both are FOX News contributors. And it is a pleasure to see you both. ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here. Thanks. BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Your reaction to what we have heard this morning, Ed Rollins? ROLLINS: The truth of the matter is what was discovered with this document and the Strzok testimony, what have you. Hillary was never a target of any investigation. Strzok admitted that. She was never under investigation. They clearly -- Strzok, I think, was one of the instruments of really going after the Trump campaign. And he's trying to woo -- he's trying to woo his girlfriend. And, basically, she was very anti-Trump. Brennan was an anti-Trump person. And my sense is that they used this idiotic document that was an opposition research document to go violate the FISA rules and all of the rest of it. And this whole thing got started -- Carter Page is not an operative for the Soviet Union. The problem was the Trump campaign didn't have the big significant foreign policy people. These were all kinds of fringe players. And I think to a certain extent they got Paul Manafort on past sins. BARTIROMO: Right. ROLLINS: That'll all be the -- next week's trial will start. But I think the reality is, there was nothing. There was no there there. And I think the American public... (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: Right. That was one of the texts. There's no there there. Peter Strzok said it. But you mentioned Carter Page. If Carter Page was an agent of foreign power, why is he still running around with no charges, James? There are no charges. FREEMAN: Right. It's been two years now. And, as you mentioned, a lot of black marker, a lot of redactions in these documents. BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. Look at this. FREEMAN: But one thing that does come through is, it appears the dossier was central to it. And when they weren't relying on the dossier, they were appealing to the authority of Yahoo News, without pointing out that that was a Steele story as well in terms of the source. BARTIROMO: It's all connected. FREEMAN: No, why do they continue to say that Steele is credible after they even acknowledge in their re-applications that he didn't do as he was told and he was sharing information with the media? That's a question. So, I think this is another argument for the president to declassify everything, get it out there. Enough of the redactions. Let's see the whole FISA applications. Let's see what are known as the Woods notes, where the FBI goes through and figures out what they can put in the FISA document. BARTIROMO: Yes. FREEMAN: We need to see where this came from. BARTIROMO: And the editorial board did an op-ed on that, asking the president to actually make sure that you declassify these documents. Is this going to hurt the Dems in the midterm? ROLLINS: I think it will, because they're just -- they're arguing things that aren't valid to the American public. And, equally as important, their party is getting so far to the left, that if Republicans, who have a lot of open seats and a lot of challenged seats, if they go out and talk about the president's programs of getting the economy moving, what have you, they will do fine. But they can't make it a national campaign. They got to make it a local campaign. BARTIROMO: Right. And we're going to get the GDP number out on Thursday, James. FREEMAN: Yes. BARTIROMO: And it may very well show 4 percent growth. The outcomes that this president has had are very positive. And they're insane over it. FREEMAN: Yes. Well, this -- I mean, going back now, two years later, there's nothing on Carter Page. Two years later, we're asked to believe that this was some secret Russian plot to revive the American economy and rebuild the U.S. military and strengthen Ukraine to resist Russian expansionism. So it gets harder and harder to believe. And I think the president and his Republican allies in Congress have a pretty strong case on the economy. ROLLINS: The one thing is, the Russians were trying to play here. And they have tried to play here for a long time. And they got more publicity this time, because there were all these investigations. BARTIROMO: Yes, and because they tried to implicate Trump. ROLLINS: But not... BARTIROMO: And we know Russia has been trying to undermine the West for a long time. ROLLINS: And not effective. BARTIROMO: Trump had nothing to do with it. Great to see you both. Thank you so much. Have a great day, everybody. I will see you next week.

JESSE WATTERS, HOST, WATTERS' WORLD: Welcome to \"Watters' World,\" I'm Jesse Watters. Three days into Election Day and President Trump still on the campaign trail rallying the crowd right now in Pensacola, Florida.\u00a0\nLet's listen in. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: \u00a0... he'd be 50 pounds lighter and the one thing they knew, it was going to be a painful, painful evening. Evander, the real deal, one of the greatest in history in my opinion. Thank you. Great Evander. Thank you very much Evander Holyfield. And we are also thrilled to be joined by a Florida football legend who truly knows how to win. He won them all and he had a great place kicker. He could have even won a couple more, right? Bobby will be the first to tell you. Bobby Bowden is an incredible man and an incredible coach and a great leader. Bobby. (Cheering and Applause) TRUMP: He looks good. He looks good. A lot of teams would like to have him right now, right? (Cheering and Applause) TRUMP: Come on, say something. Come here Bobby. BOBBY BOWDEN, RETIRED AMERICAN FOOTBALL COACH: Thank you, Don. Thank you all. Thank you all. God, so we have a great crowd. You know what I was thinking a while ago. The most of powerful man in the world. The most of powerful position in the world is the President of the United States. (Cheering and Applause) BOWDEN: Also like some of the other folks tonight. I want you to keep your eye on Ron DeSantis as you vote this year. I think he'll do you a great job, and then also, our former governor Rick Scott. Look at them good because I know he wants them, okay? I came to Florida State in 1963 as an assistant coach. You know where my recruiting area was? Right here, baby. Right here. And we've got some great ball players from Pensacola, Florida. WATTERS: All right, that was President Trump and legendary Florida State college football coach, Bobby Bowden saying some things down there at the rally in the Sunshine State. The Commander in Chief in the middle of a huge campaign blitz making a major push for Republicans before voters head to the polls on Tuesday. Here with reaction, senior advisor to the Trump 2020 campaign, Katrina Pierson; and former White House Communications Director and the author of \"Trump the Blue Collar President,\" Anthony Scaramucci who is wearing a white collar. I think that was a wardrobe malfunction. SCARAMUCCI: No, it's the closest that the president ever got to a blue collar was a shirt like this, but it has a great tie to look. WATTERS: Anyway, looking very sharp, so the president down there in Florida and I have to say, he has really left it all out on the field if we are going with the sports analogies and Bobby Bowden, rally after rally after rally and they have history against him, they have a special counsel.\u00a0\nThey have a media against him, if they do not win the House, it's not for a lack of trying and effort on the President's part, Anthony. SCARAMUCCI: I agree with that and there is a former hedge fund manager named Robert Radano who had the polling right in 2016, is calling for the Republicans to keep the House. So we'll have to see what happens, but he thinks that the way these polls are done today, there is a little bit of the Bradley effect where people are not going to tell you that they are voting for the Republicans but in fact, they are; and then they are not administered right in terms of the anonymity of the polling. So let's see what happens. But there are people out there that think that they are going to keep the House, and so that would be big. WATTERS: So your hedge fund buddy, the guy who nailed it in 2016 is saying the same analytics hold true right now, is that there is a silent majority out there who don't necessarily talk to pollsters and they don't express their love for Donald Trump that vociferously, but when they get behind the ballot box - the secret ballot, they're going to crank that lever.\u00a0\nKatrina, do you agree with that? KATRINA PIERSON, SENIOR ADVISER TO THE TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Oh, I absolutely agree. WATTERS: So you're saying they are keeping the House. PIERSON: Anthony is right. I think there is a very good chance that they could keep the House. As you mentioned, the historical context, we have record number of retirements. Everything is against the party this time, but aside from the people who aren't possibly telling the pollsters exactly what they think, there are so many people all across this country. I've been out there, Jesse. They're telling me, \"You know, I wasn't on board for President Trump at first, but man, he's doing a good job.\" There's going to be new supporters for Donald Trump out there and it's good. WATTERS: So you are saying he's adding new voters from the last time around. PIERSON: Absolutely. He's absolutely adding voters. WATTERS: Is that because if you think of the economy? Is that because they've warmed personally to his style? What do you attribute that to? Because you have been out there. I'm holed up in the studio all day. I don't go out in the fields anymore - out on the streets. PIERSON: I think it's a little bit of both to be honest with you. I think this whole Russia hoax, people see that there has been a huge injustice to this family, not just the president himself. They see innocent bystanders - people that just took a job that are publicly assassinated, their characters, their livelihoods and people at home are seeing this and they don't like it and they see the President is doing a great job with the economy. His platform - keeping his promises, people aren't used to politicians keeping their promises and fighting back even against their own party when necessary, to accomplish those goals. WATTERS: Well, I mean, he's been the victim of a huge injustice when you think about Spygate and all of the things like the media that they throw at him, and the Kavanaugh situation reinvigorated that injustice that was served upon that man. Let's listen again to the President who is back behind the lectern and hear what he has to say. TRUMP: And by the way, you have a very good Attorney General right now, you know that, right? Pam. Is Pam - great. You like Pam, right? Okay, then I like you, Ashley. Good luck. I hear you are doing well. Good luck. Very important position. Your next Agriculture Commissioner Matt Caldwell, Matt? Matt, thank you. Great matt. Thank you. Florida CFO, Jimmy Petronas. Good luck, Jimmy. Good job. Good job, fellas. And Congressmen that helped me so much. They are always with us. They are always fighting for us and they win, they know how to win, like Bobby. They know how to win. Neil Dunn and Matt Gaetz. (Cheering and Applause) TRUMP: Thank you, thanks, Neil, thanks, Matt. Great people. So if you don't want to be saying Speaker Pelosi ... (Booing) TRUMP: \u00a0... for the next two years, vote for Neil and Matt. I hear they are doing pretty well, but never assume please go out and vote. They've heard that in this business, right? They are doing well. We don't have to go out and vote, you have that, and then you have suppression. Where they suppress the polls, you don't bother to go out and vote. But that didn't happen with us two years ago, did it. That didn't happen. One of the most of exciting days in political history, but honestly, one of the highest rated nights in the history of television. A lot of good things happened, but most importantly, what we did is we won, and we won for incredible people in this country. Incredible people. They got what they wanted, and we are producing and we did it together. I didn't do it. We all did it together. This Tuesday the people of Florida are going to head to the polls to elect an incredible new senator. As your governor, Rick Scott, cut your taxes massively by billions of dollars. Think of it. WATTERS: Okay, there is President Trump touting Rick Scott, the governor right now who is running against - I think what's this guy? The Democrat Nelson that comes up every six years. He wants to be senator again and then you don't hear from him for another six years. And that's a tight race. That's steady, but Anthony, I wanted to ask you, the President's closing message seems to be beating the immigration drum. But he has the Kavanaugh bounce. He has - ISIS has been annihilated, but the economy - this economy is white hot right now. Wage growth is at record highs.\u00a0\nThere is great paying jobs out there, and we are going to see 3% GDP for the year. Is the economy what's kind of keeping the blue wave at bay in your opinion? SCARAMUCCI: Well, I think the economy does do that, but I think what the President is worried about is that there is a complacency with all of that good news and prosperity. One of the reasons why Presidents lose midterm elections is that complacent voters don't go out and vote, Jesse. It's angry voters that are not empowered that rush to vote and that's why he is pressing all of these hot buttons in the last five or six days because he wants to get that base back out there. And if you look at the early voting total ... WATTERS: Yes, it's big, right? SCARAMUCCI: It's off the charts. So he's obviously doing something that's very, very effective and I don't remember President Obama barnstorming like this or George W. Bush barnstorming like this. And so it's a new strategy. People 50 years from now are going to study what he's doing and politicians have to change their playbook because of Donald Trump. WATTERS: Yes, I remember Barack Obama staying away from certain campaigns and places. SCARAMUCCI: Kind of rose garden strategy more than this kind of a strategy. WATTERS: Yes. Yes. This President is definitely out there in the mud.\u00a0\nSpeaking of Florida, we have this governor's race DeSantis and Gillum and some explosive sting video was released by James O'Keefe at Project Veritas. One of Gillum - the Democrat candidate's staffers, I don't know how high level or not was caught on tape really saying some nasty things about the voters of Florida. Let's listen. (END VIDEO CLIP) OMAR SMITH, GILLUM CAMPAIGN STAFFER: You have the extreme right wingers, those are the Trump and the crazy, crazy, crazy, Republicans and the progressives are the crazy, crazy, crazy Democrats. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Isn't Gillum a progressive? SMITH: Gillum is a progressive. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So Gillum is part of the crazy crazies? SMITH: He is part of the crazy, crazy, crazy. This is a [bleep] ass state. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay. SMITH: It's a cracker state. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay. SMITH: Okay. Ask anybody outside of here, you go across St. Louis and Orlando, man, them crackers are ain't going to let us do that [bleep]. They're crazy. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right, so this Democratic campaign staffer, he got canned pretty fast because that's unacceptable to be disparaging your own citizens in your own state like that. There's a kind of a pattern, Katrina of Democrats pretending like they are moderate, pretending like they are open minded and then behind the scenes trashing people in a very vitriolic way.\u00a0\nAre they going to be able to get away with that? PIERSON: Well, I think we are going to find out, Jesse. But this is exactly the pattern and how socialists and progressives have taken over your parents and grandparents' Democratic Party. You had staffers from multiple campaigns empowered by this group who were talking about how they have to lie to the electorate to get their voters, and in the case of Florida, this wasn't just a paid campaign staffer. This is a man who went to college with Gillum and knew him prior to joining the campaign who calls the white people in this state crackers and admits that they have to lie to them, they have to cover up their support for gun control in order to get people on board, admitted to capitalizing on white guilt to get this support. So my question as a biracial American, half my family is white, my question to white Democrats is have you even thought what this looks like for you 10 to 20 years down the line? WATTERS: Right. It's also - you have Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill.\u00a0\nYou have Jon Tester in Montana and then Sinema in Arizona. It's these red state senate Democratic candidates that are trying to move to the middle but they are really not like that deep down because they get back to Washington and they vote for crying Chuck. SCARAMUCCI: But they are also responding to the President. They can't deal with him and so they are lurching back and forth between identity politics, race baiting. Calling other people racists. One of the points in my book is that he stole their blue collar base and he moved it over to the Republican Party. How did he do that? They would be way smarter, Jesse, if they said, \"Whoa, whoa. He did that, let's fix that.\" But they are not willing to admit the mistake that they made over the last 30 years of abandoning what was their core constituency and now that core constituency is showing up at those rallies and they all call them xenophobic, they'll call them nationalistic. They call them deplorable.\u00a0\nIt's not helping them. And so I don't know why they are doing it, but they are getting caught on tape more than once. WATTERS: So the blue collar base as you write about, and as you were just mentioning, are they going to come out again like they did in 2016 for this President? I know he's not necessarily on the ballot. But these are the people that were inspired by the trade commentary. These are the people that were inspired by immigration. Are those people in the rust belt? Or even in Florida, are they going to come out and vote Republican? PIERSON: I do think they are going to vote Republican, Jesse because as we mentioned earlier, the President is now talking about immigration out there in all of these rallies because he unlike previous candidates have had a bold agenda, a wide variety of things that he promised to the people. The economy is doing great. He's making progress on trade and now, we have to fix immigration in this country and that's why he's out there campaigning on it. That was the number one issue during the 2016 campaign, he needs to hold the Senate and keep the House to move forward. WATTERS: So you think he attracted these people in 2016 and he has now successfully held them? And they are now his base and he's not going to let them go? PIERSON: Absolutely. Absolutely. WATTERS: Do you agree with it? SCARAMUCCI: Not only agree with it, I had been at ... WATTERS: They're not up for grabs. SCARAMUCCI: I have been doing a lot of campaigning. I was out in Suffolk County with John Lavelle two nights ago. You have union leaders that are sitting there with Republican Party officials voting for Donald J. Trump. WATTERS: All right. All right, well, blue collar President, we've got blue collar millionaire over here. SCARAMUCCI: Is it a good inscription or what? WATTERS: Yes, I like the inscription. Let me - I'm going to read the inscription here. Let's see what it says. SCARAMUCCI: It's very important. WATTERS: And I'm not making this up. SCARAMUCCI: It's \"Watters' World\" and it's your world, I'm just living in it, so go ahead. WATTERS: It says, \"Jesse, my hero and the American dream. My love, Anthony Scaramucci.\" Anthony, come on, that's better ... PIERSON: I love it. SCARAMUCCI: Come on, that's better than the Christmas ... WATTERS: Thank you very much. I appreciate that. SCARAMUCCI: That's better than Christmas for you, Jesse. Come on. WATTERS: All right, how's that. Thank you, guys. Katrina, thank you. PIERSON: Thanks, Jesse. WATTERS: All right, coming up next, Eric Carter back from Guatemala and the migrant caravan - a \"Watters' World\" weekend exclusive with the truth from the ground down there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: And did you see where Homeland Security - you know, they're saying how do you know? How do you know? There's some bad hombres in that group.\u00a0\nSo they came out with a list of 300 really bad ones - really bad ones.\u00a0\nThey're in there and now, they have worse caravans actually, worse caravans being formed and started. The Democrats only believe in defending the borders of foreign countries. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Bad hombres, that's how President Trump described some members of the migrant caravan, but if you listen to the mainstream media they are all angels fleeing cartel violence, so what is the truth. Joining me now, Fox News contributor and fellow at the Independent Women's Forum, Sara Carter who was recently in Guatemala covering the caravan. All right, Sara, so you've heard the media describe these people as, you know, good people, women and children. Was that your understanding when you were seeing them face to face? SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS: Unfortunately, no. I mean, there were women and children at the front end. I was in Guatemala. I was there for the second wave that was coming across the Honduran border. So I was right there in a town called Chiquimula, right on the Honduran border as they were moving across and they put the women and children's lives actually in danger. What these organizers of the caravan would do would put maybe 100 to 200 women and children, and some disabled, some elderly at the front of the group. And then the rest of the group, and this is what I saw with my own eyes were men. I mean, there were roughly 1,400 to 1,500 men behind them.\u00a0\nThey would start pushing against the women and children. The Guatemalan government was telling them, \"Please turn around and go back. You will not be allowed into the United States,\" but as in Europe, Central America has a process by which if you have papers, you can cross through the border system. So they didn't want the women and children to be harmed, so they processed the women and children through. WATTERS: So it's literally women and children first, but not in a good way. CARTER: Not in a good way at all. WATTERS: And so the men are really taking advantage and using the women and children as kind of the tip of the spear. CARTER: That's absolutely right, Jesse. That's absolutely right. WATTERS: You talked about the organizers of the caravan, did you get any information on that? CARTER: Well, according to the intelligence officers that I spoke to on the ground now, I was with Guatemalan intelligence as well as other intelligence officials on the ground. They were informed that a lot of the leftist groups in Honduras, in El Salvador were organizing these caravans. And it appeared to me to be very highly organized because one, I speak Spanish, I know what's going on. There were people within the group that were kind of guiding the other men in the group. Now, imagine... WATTERS: Right, but what was the purpose of the left wing groups in Central America for organizing the caravan north? CARTER: Well, they have multiple reasons. One, they want to divide the governments -- conservative governments of Guatemala or Honduras from the United States. WATTERS: That makes sense. CARTER: They want to cause a ruckus. WATTERS: So it is about domestic politics and causing mass mayhem down there internally in order to maybe overturn some current government. CARTER: Exactly. Exactly. WATTERS: Is the President speaking about the caravan? Let's listen to the President of the United States who is down in Florida talking about this issue. TRUMP: You've got to come in legally, folks. You can't come in that way. And by the way, caravan after caravan; and we pay these countries where they are formed -- Honduras and all of them -- we pay them hundreds of millions of dollars and they do nothing for us. They do nothing. They do nothing for us. They had a new one just formed in El Salvador. We pay them a lot - we pay them all, hundreds of millions of dollars, they do nothing. And did you see Mexico is trying, they are trying and their military and their police stood guard, and the level of viciousness with the rocks being thrown in their face. Their military was hurt. Their police, their law enforcement, they were hurt. We don't put up with that. We don't put up with that. We don't want - we don't want that in our country. We are not going to have it in our country. They broke through - they give it - they broke through the Mexican military and the Mexican police. They broke through. WATTERS: Okay, so the President, Sara talking about, we have all seen the images of this, of these young men throwing rocks and bloodying up Mexican law enforcement officials. It seems like kind of a rowdy crew down there.\u00a0\nIt doesn't look like the kind of people that you want to say, \"Oh, yes, come on into the country,\" as they are throwing elbows and rocks at Mexican law enforcement. When you were talking to people down there, what was the criminal element like? Approximately. CARTER: Well, I did. I did see visibly MS-13 members within the group that I was with. A lot of them were very demanding. They said, \"We're going there. We're going to get jobs.\" They were also talking badly about President Trump. They were saying, \"If he doesn't give us jobs, we are coming into the country and demand our rights.\" And I said, \"Well, what would it take for you to return home?\" I mean, \"You're coming to the United States ...\" WATTERS: Where have I heard that before? It sounds like I've heard that here in the United States. CARTER: Well, it's our loopholes, Jesse. I mean, look, we have so many loopholes in our system and they know it and they play these loopholes whether it's family units, which we have seen a 40% increase this year in family units. They know how to play this game, and they are also being taught. So once they get into Mexico and once they start moving through Mexico. Believe me, the drug cartels are watching this as well as the smugglers. Yes, they know it's escape. WATTERS: Of course, they wouldn't get there without safe passage from the drug cartels. And then they get lawyers down there coaching them on what to say. What the left doesn't understand though is, once if you are a Central American and you come in with a family member, who knows if they are actually a family member, they are minors ... CARTER: That's right. WATTERS: You have to stay. They have to let them here in America until their asylum case is heard. And I'm thinking to myself, \"You guys want to take that risk?\" We don't know who these people are? You've got to vet them in a port of entry like every other person that comes, but for some reason they don't want to get vetted when they are in the Texas border.\u00a0\nI've got to go, Sara. CARTER: Well, that's right, that's under the 9th Circuit and this is the reason why. WATTERS: I know. Another loophole. CARTER: Yes, another loophole. WATTERS: We've got to close. We've got to close the border and the loophole, Sara. Great reporting down there, I really appreciate it. CARTER: Thank you. WATTERS: All right, next, Maxine Waters in charge of Wall Street? That and other nightmare scenarios if the Democrats take over the House, up next. EBONI WILLIAMS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Eboni K. Williams. Tallahassee police are saying that this man, 40-year-old Scott Paul Beierle, posed as a customer at a yoga studio and then started shooting people without warning. Two women were killed and at least, five others were injured. Beirle then he turned the gun on himself. Now police are still investigating a possible motive for the deadly attack. About 100 people gathering in what they are calling a healing service outside of the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 people were killed a week ago. The 45-minute event featured prayers, songs and poetry. Six other people were injured in the October 27th rampage. It is considered one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish people in US history. Suspect Robert Bowers pleaded not guilty on Thursday to Federal hate crime charges. WATTERS: With the midterm right around the corner, a blue wave may be creeping up and there is a possibility the Democrats might take control of the House. Here to react, Republican Congressman from Wisconsin, Sean Duffy. All right, Congressman, I heard some sound from your friend Maxine Waters, no relation to myself, and it terrified everybody, especially some people in the business community. Let's listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAXINE WATERS, US CONGRESSWOMAN, CALIFORNIA, DEMOCRAT: I will be the first African-American, the first woman to chair the powerful Financial Services Committee. That's all of Wall Street. That's all the insurance companies.\u00a0\nThat's all the banks. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: \u00a0Maxine Waters is going to be in charge of policing Wall Street and you say what? SEAN DUFFY, US CONGRESSMAN, WISCONSIN, REPUBLICAN: She is no Jesse Watters, Jesse. She is - I don't care about her race. I care that she is a socialist. I mean, with the financial services committee, we are the plummet of free enterprise. I mean, we are what makes the economy. Look, this is capital markets, banks and insurance and she is a radical leftist, so she'll be the first socialist to actually chair this committee and they want more rules, they want more regulations. Some even, Elizabeth Warren said we shouldn't have banks do banking, we should have the post office and the government do it. WATTERS: Oh boy. Yes because the post office does such a great job delivering mail. The Wall Street fat cats are going to have to grease her big time. They are going to have to send that socialist Maxine so much money to stay out of their business. I don't know. She's just going to be overflowing. Also, what they want to do, if they take the House, they're going to reinvestigate Kavanaugh and possibly impeach Kavanaugh? What would that look like? DUFFY: So Jesse, now, though they had - who would-be new chair of the Judiciary Committee, he says, I wants to impeach Judge Kavanaugh. They all want to impeach Donald Trump and the House Republicans, we fought to give more power to the American people, giving them power and control over their money and their lives and their jobs and their business. Democrats see this winning and because they are socialists, they go, \"No, no. We've got to stop the winning. We want to re-empower Washington, and so to do that, they have to distract Donald Trump, to try to destroy Donald Trump and if they do that, and can stop the winning for the American people, they hope that they can win in 2020. This is what this is all about. WATTERS: Yes, it's true, I mean, you just said the 4.2 GDP growth and you had 3.5 percent GDP grown and the Democrats are saying, \"Whoa, whoa. Let's slow this thing down here. This economy is getting too good. We have got to pump the brakes.\" All right, you mentioned - I think they want to go after the President's taxes. Now, as you know, the President has not released his taxes. I don't think he is going to release his taxes. If the Democrats do take the House back, can they subpoena President Donald Trump's taxes? DUFFY: They can try, and I think the IRS can try to stop them. But no doubt, they will go down on this road, but just for your viewers, the President doesn't have to release his taxes. Now, many Presidents in the past have released their taxes, but Donald Trump didn't and he's not required to. WATTERS: Right. DUFFY: So this is again an attack that could distract, but... WATTERS: And it's going to take so much attention. They are going to throw subpoenas everywhere. And they are not going to be able to get anything done and the media is going to cover it. Taxes, Trump taxes. He is fighting releasing his taxes. It's just gamesmanship. Do you think if they do retake the House that the American people are just going to get sick of all the games? Because if you look at the Democratic platform, it looks like all games. DUFFY: And they will stop us from giving additional tax cuts to middle class Americans. They will stop us from securing the border and by the way, we had a vote in the House, Jesse. You're talking about the caravan coming north in the last couple of segments, we had a vote in the House that said, you have to be an American citizen to vote in an American election. All Republicans voted for that, virtually all Democrats voted against, actually having only Americans vote in the American elections... WATTERS: Wait, slow down for a second. Democrats in the House voted against a bill that said only Americans can vote in an American election? DUFFY: An American election. WATTERS: There were no Democrats that voted with you guys. DUFFY: They voted - no, there was a handful of Democrats that voted yes. But a majority of them voted no or voted present... WATTERS: Why? DUFFY: Because they are fundamentally opposed to Americans voting in American elections because they've sold out to the open borders radical left, Jesse. WATTERS: I thought they don't like foreign interference in elections? DUFFY: Yes, so did I, but... WATTERS: I mean, isn't that what that's about? DUFFY: If you have foreign interference that helps them, Jesse, they love it. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I know, you mentioned immigration, wall funding. Is that just completely off the table if the Democrats take the House back? DUFFY: So what's happened is Republicans in the House, we passed border funding bills. It is going to the Senate because of the funky rules over there. You need Democrats to vote for it so we've been a few votes shy. But if we pick up seats in the Senate and we keep the House, we're going to get the border wall built. But if Democrats take control, that's absolutely off the table and I think you'll have mass chaos at the border. WATTERS: Last question, I only have 30 seconds, Congressman, if the Democrats do take the House, can you in a lame duck session jam through wall funding while you have about a month and a half in between the new Congress? DUFFY: Well, we can try, but again, we have to get that through the Senate. There are still nine Senate Democrats that would stop us there, but if we pick up seats and keep the House, that's a real possibility. We can actually get this done. This is not a foregone conclusion, Jesse. We can still win this in the hands of the American people to say no to the radical left. WATTERS: No, I agree. I agree. Everyone is saying no wave. I agree, we are not going to know until Tuesday night. It's all still... DUFFY: Let's keep winning, Jesse. WATTERS: That's right. That's right. We're not sick of it yet. Thank you, Congressman. DUFFY: We're not sick. Thank you. WATTERS: All right, coming up, two political analysts on whether the blue wave is actually real. Right back with that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN COLBERT, TALK SHOW HOST: There has been a lot of talk lately about lowering the temperature of political discourse. Have you seen evidence of that? NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER, DEMOCRAT: I think when we win you will see evidence of that, because when we do win, we will have as we open a new Congress, we will honor the vows of our founders -- E Pluribus Unum -- from many one. It's okay to disagree in the marketplace of ideas, that's exciting, but it is also important to find solutions that unify and not divide. And that's what makes a big difference between Democrats ... (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right, Nancy Pelosi, a little cocky predicting - guaranteeing in fact a Democratic win in the House. This election cycle, the balance of power in Congress could swing either way though. Thirty five Senate seats are up for grabs. Democrats need to win two to retake the Senate and pick up 23 additional seats in the House to get control there. Here with the key two the races, the Editor at Large for Ballot PD, and pollster at ScottRasmussen.com, Scott Rasmussen and senior elections analyst of Real Clear Politics, Sean Trende, which is a great name for a political analyst. All right, Sean, we've seen wave elections in the past, 1994, 2006 - do you historically - are you getting those signals that you're seeing, a 40, a 50, a 60-seat Democratic wave in the House? SEAN TRENDE, ELECTIONS ANALYST, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Like they say, there is a reason we hold the elections. So we'll only have to wait about 48 more hours now, but look. You look at the generic ballot, it has Democrats up seven and a half points, and Republicans traditionally do not always over perform it. You look at enthusiasm. Republicans and Democrats are about equally even enthused right now. You look at party registration. There hasn't been a drop off in Republican Party registration like you usually see in wave years. You just look at the number of factors that you expect to see in a wave year and they don't really line up. Again, I don't know exactly what's going to happen, but something just seems off. WATTERS: Right, it does seem off because when you have everybody on the left, the media, the Democrats and even Colbert saying, it's a lock, and then that's what they did in 2016, so you're thinking if they were wrong in 2016, could they be wrong again, Scott? SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR AT LARGE FOR BALLOT PD: Well, first of all, the 2016 challenge was the analysis. It wasn't really the polling data, just everybody looked at it and said, \"This can't be right. There is no way Donald Trump will end up close.\" Right now, people have been expecting a blue wave for a very long time, and as Sean mentioned, there are some indications that maybe things are a little tighter. What is missing from this entire discussion is a one or two-point swing in the turnout and either direction could have a profound impact. If it swings one or two points towards the Republicans, they could keep the House. If it swings one or two points further into the Democrats favor, we could be looking at a 40-seat win. WATTERS: That's right. This thing is not guaranteed and as you said, there is a few days left. All right, let's look at these some of these Senate races, Scott. We have Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada - all of these seem very, very tight and a lot of people are predicting the Republicans to do very well in the Senate. How do you see it? RASMUSSEN: All five of the toss up races in the Senate, it wouldn't shock me if either candidate won any of the races. But when I look at it collectively, Republicans are more likely to pick up seats than to lose. I guess my best guess would be that net a couple, the Republican that I'm - I guess, I would say has the best chance of winning right now is Martha McSally in Arizona, followed by Hawley in Missouri and Braun in Indiana.\u00a0\nThose last two just because the states are so heavily Republican. Rick Scott in Florida in a very competitive race, but Florida is always close and it's not a great year to be a Republican campaigning there. Dean Heller in Nevada, he has the toughest fight he has all year. He's the only Republican running in a state - only Republican incumbent running in a state won by Hillary Clinton. WATTERS: Sean, what do you think? Real quick. TRENDE: Yes, I see it about the same as Scott. I think the interesting thing is that you have all of these races that are on a knife's edge. They tend to fall altogether in these elections, because of what Scott said. If the polls are just a little bit off, it's make a big difference. It's very possible we could wake up on Wednesday and Republicans haven't moved, but I think it's important to emphasize, we could wake up Wednesday morning and the Republicans have picked up four or five seats in the Senate. \u00a0It's that close. WATTERS: But they can't get to 60, is that right? There is no chance that Republicans are getting to 60 in the Senate because that would change a lot of things? Or am I dreaming? TRENDE: If they get to 60, I should hang up my spurs and go back to practicing law. WATTERS: All right, guys, thanks a lot. RASMUSSEN: Thank you. WATTERS: One of Judge Kavanaugh's accusers backtracking on her rape claim, said she made the whole thing up. Where is the media coverage on that?\u00a0\nNext. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN: This is a very big night for the President of the United States. He is all in on fear and loathing. ALISYN CAMEROTA, ANCHOR, CNN: President Trump is ratcheting up his anti- immigration rhetoric and using the White House podium to stoke fears and rally Republican voters. CHRIS MATTHEWS, ANCHOR, CNN: Stoking fear anger and anxiety, President is going to new extremes to rile up white voters in red state America. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Just a few days to go and the liberal media switching into high gear with its verbal attacks against President trump. Joining me now to debate, conservative commentator Rob Smith and liberal commentator, Cathy Areu. All right, guys, so this is just breaking. One of the women who accused Kavanaugh of rape, her name, Judy Munroe-Leighton. She was just investigated, and it turns out she made the whole thing up and admitted to making the whole thing up and wasted everybody's time. Grassley sent investigators to talk to her and she said, \"I did it because I just wanted to draw attention to the issue, and I lied.\" I don't see the media making any noise about it, Cathy, why do you think that is? CATHY AREU, LIBERAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I am glad the media is not making any noise because Kavanaugh doesn't need the media to make more noise about these things. So, no let's push it aside, it's over. WATTERS: Don't you think to be fair, they should go back and they should say, \"You know what, this is a woman that came forward with a false rape claim and put it in the context of the entire hearing.\" Because there were also a lot of other false rape claims, too, remember?\n\u00a0\nAREU: Some people don't want to hear that, so ... WATTERS: \u00a0... remember with Avenatti's people. AREU: But we don't need to hear that. ROB SMITH, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: But you do need to hear that. They spent so much time on all of these other claims that were out there. Just an onslaught ... AREU: Which was a waste of time as well. SMITH: \u00a0... of story after story. \u00a0It was a waste of everybody's time. AREU: It was. (CROSSTALK) SMITH: But they need to give this accuser backtracking the same amount of time that they gave to all the other accusers. AREU: Kavanaugh does not need that. No, no. I don't think so. Let it go. WATTERS: Let it go? AREU: Absolutely. WATTERS: Okay, now want to let it go afterwards. AREU: No, I said Dr. Ford should not have been given so much attention. I thought Kavanaugh should have been just - no, no ... SMITH: But I think that a lot of people that were unsure ... AREU: No investigation. SMITH: \u00a0... a lot of people that were unsure about that in the first place\u00a0\nthat were made to be feel because they weren't sure need this to be out there so that they can feel a little bit more confident and hey, maybe people need to be innocent until proven guilty. AREU: No, we don't need to divide the country more. WATTERS: Well, okay, Cathy, speaking of divide in the country ... AREU: The country doesn't need that. Right, right. WATTERS: A poll just came out. \u00a0Has the national news media done more to divide or unite the country since Trump took office? 64 percent said they are dividers and the same question with Donald Trump and it turns out, the media is viewed as more divisive than Donald Trump by the American people. SMITH: Absolutelyl. WATTERS: Isn't that amazing - can you believe that? SMITH: I can't ... WATTERS: That's not what the media has been saying. SMITH: Well, the thing about it is that, the media is drunk on the President. They are drunk on Donald Trump. Anything that they can possibly say to make this administration appear negative or racist or anything like that, they go for it and so often, a lot of the social media platforms, they are used to put together like put forth information that is just not true or that's misreported. AREU: Trump is drunk off the media and social media. He gets drunk off of them. He gets drunk off everything. Everyone is drunk ... WATTERS: The whole country is drunk. SMITH: Everybody is drunk apparently, Jesse. AREU: And Trump is the one at the very top. Yes, he is leading it. WATTERS: But what do you make of the fact that the American people after two years of this nonsense and after the media is saying that Trump is the divider-in-chief, they are the ones viewed as the divisive ones. AREU: Trump is controlling the media. WATTERS: This is a political poll. AREU: I know, it's political. WATTERS: Tis is no a fake news poll. AREU: I've read that, I know. I know, but Trump is like their puppet and he's pulling the strings. I think Trump is wonderful at controlling the media. He is the President. SMITH: He doesn't control - the media ... AREU: The President controls the media. SMITH: The media has Trump derangement syndrome and I think it is terminal. I think that they want to push out anything that's negative about this person because they know he gets clicks. AREU: No, he is amazing at driving the message. He is amazing at putting that fear up and then the confidence. SMITH: Absolutely right. AREU: He is a master at it. WATTERS: In just the last week, the media lectured everybody on divisive rhetoric and violence and racism, and then literally a week later, Jane Fonda called Trump Hitler. Alec Baldwin punched someone in the face and then CNN says white men are the biggest threat to America. I mean, do they look in the mirror? SMITH: Yes, from ... WATTERS: They don't look in the mirror ... SMITH: Yes, from an anchor that's partnered with the white men but that's neither here nor there. AREU: Again, Trump has never said anything that's divisive or negative about minorities. WATTERS: Well, you know what Cathy, we have got to go. Thank you very much.

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster: Roseanne Barr and the new political correctness - Garrett drops re-election bid due to alcoholism - Bipartisan lawmakers in talks to revive DACA bill - Trump accuses Mueller\u2019s Dems of meddling - Bro\u2026 ROSEANNE BARR AND THE NEW POLITICAL CORRECTNESS Who knew that making a professional vulgarian and an infamous kook a face of your political movement could be so risky? There will be many millions of pixels wasted in the name of debating whether ABC was right or wrong to terminate\u00a0Roseanne Barr\u2019s eponymous sitcom after the comedian likened a former White House official of black ancestry to an ape. If you feel obliged to have an opinion on that subject your view is likely shaped by your politics and is therefore something of a foregone conclusion. The same goes for your estimation of her show in the first place. So powerful is the draw of political tribalism that people are now increasingly able to turn their tastes on a dime in order to conform with what is politically correct. Barr\u2019s act in the show that it produced is all about being shocking. It was shocking when she spit and grabbed her way through the national anthem and it was shocking when she and her TV character so brutally assaulted conventional norms about middle class marriage and family. A generation ago she was admired on the left for skewering\u00a0June Cleaver\u00a0expectations for media moms. This time around her admirers have been mostly on the right since she has adopted her support for\u00a0President Trump\u00a0as her preferred outraged generation device. Like a lot of middle aged white dudes who suddenly started appreciating\u00a0Kanye West\u2019s rhymes, Trump supporters were excited to see someone who unabashedly rooted for the president, even if it was just an exercise in trolling liberals. After all it seems like that\u2019s the point of a lot of what Republicans do these days. It tends to matter less whether something is good or bad or even congruent with a philosophy as much as it matters that something will \u201cmake heads explode.\u201d Similarly, Democrats express strange new respect for ultra conservative Republicans, like Sen.\u00a0Ben Sasse,\u00a0R-Neb., or even Attorney General\u00a0Jeff Sessions\u00a0when they bedevil Trump. And political correctness in cultural choices has a much longer history on the left side of the aisle. Surely no living human could endure a set of\u00a0Kathy Griffin\u2019s comedy unless they believe they were doing it for a political cause. But now, Republicans are fully engaged in the act. This isn\u2019t just the wistful nostalgia of\u00a0Pat Boone\u00a0or\u00a0Wayne Newton\u00a0from the Reagan era. This is full blown art as cultural weapon. If you are fool enough to allow strangers to dictate your likes or dislikes in music, movies, books and television there\u2019s not much we can tell you. You drank the Kool-Aid and are mixing up another pitcher. We don\u2019t know whether or not the president will stay strong with Barr in light of her racist remark. Her comment came in support of the kind of batty conspiracy theories in which some in the president\u2019s orbit \u2013 and sometimes the president himself \u2013 have trafficked. Trump has in the past defended racists and kooks who were part of his broader political tribe. This is, after all, a guy who gave an interview to\u00a0Alex Jones. And it\u2019s potentially useful for Trump to embrace the idea of Barr as a victim. This would work well with his general narrative that middle class white voters are being persecuted. There are obvious down sides in aligning oneself with someone with a record like Barr\u2019s, but the president has already taken that leap with her. If whole controversy creates an enormous, divisive uproar, then it would fit very well with the president\u2019s overall political style. It is too late to try to get politics out of art and popular culture. When you are at a point where\u00a0Taylor Swift\u00a0is criticized for not taking political positions, you know that we are not going back to the old, more pleasant arrangement where people did not much know or care about the political views of their preferred entertainers. Politics and culture are kind of like government and religion: Both are harmed by their co-mingling. It's fine to debate whether or not Barr is too nasty to be on prime time television. It\u2019s even possible that some good might come from such a discussion. And it\u2019s understandable that people feel greater sympathy for those who feel sympathy for them. But what makes no sense is ever giving up your own taste in art to meet the expectations of your fellow partisans. THE RULEBOOK: IT\u2019S IN THE DETAILS \u201cSense, perception, judgment, desire, volition, memory, imagination, are found to be separated by such delicate shades and minute gradations that their boundaries have eluded the most subtle investigations, and remain a pregnant source of ingenious disquisition and controversy.\u201d \u2013 James Madison, Federalist No. 37 \u00a0TIME OUT: \u2018THEY CALL ME BABY DRIVER\u2026\u2019WSJ: \u201cOver time, many other antiquated auto features have been ruthlessly abandoned\u2014hand-crank starters and windows, carburetors and cassette decks. But stick-shifting has defiantly stuck around, joining ax throwing, rock climbing and ultramarathons as an activity people stubbornly enjoy despite its needless difficulty. \u2026\u00a0Thomas Plucinsky, a company representative for BMW, \u2018There is no longer a logical reason to shift manually.\u2019 Cars with automatic transmissions accelerate faster, drive more smoothly and get better fuel economy than stick shifts, he pointed out. One could argue that manually shifting a modern car makes about as much sense as milling your own flour, building a fire to heat your home or drawing water from a well. Even many pro drivers race automatics these days. \u2026 But many people still buy stick shift cars for \u2018emotional reasons,\u2019 Mr. Plucinsky said. \u2018They enjoy the mechanical feedback, which is part of the fun of driving even if they are just commuting to work.\u2019\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us atHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.

Thomas Garrett (R-Va.) announced Monday that he is struggling with alcoholism and will abandon his run for a second term in Congress so he can focus on recovery and his family. Garrett, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, is the 48th Republican to retire or announce they will not seek reelection to the House this year, according to a list maintained by the House Press Gallery. Many are leaving in anticipation of a strong Democratic performance in congressional races this fall and out of frustration with partisan politics in Washington. Garrett, 46, was facing a robust challenge from his Democratic opponent, journalist and author Leslie Cockburn, who had raised more money and had more cash on hand than he had. In recent days, unnamed former staffers had accused him and his wife of mistreating staff who worked in his congressional office. But in a videotaped statement, Garrett, a former Virginia state senator, said his departure from politics was spurred by his addiction.\u201d Distillery owner first to enter race to replace Garrett - WaPo: \u201cHours after Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) made the surprise announcement that he will not seek reelection in central Virginia, potential candidates began jockeying to replace him and one officially entered the race. Denver Riggleman, a former Air Force intelligence officer and distillery owner who ran a short-lived campaign for governor last year, said he is seeking the Republican nomination to help pass President Trump\u2019s agenda in Congress. \u2018As we have all seen over the past few years, it takes a real outsider with real world experience to drag the swamp monsters to dry land,\u2019 he said in a statement. \u2018As a veteran and small business owner, I am perfectly suited for that task.\u2019 Riggleman is the first candidate to publicly confirm he will run after Garrett announced his struggle with alcoholism, but there is a long list of other potential candidates, including four from the General Assembly.\u201d Trump to hold rally in Nashville tonight - AP: \u201cTrump is traveling to Nashville, Tennessee, on Tuesday to raise campaign cash for Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the party\u2019s leading U.S. Senate hopeful in Tennessee, and to headline a rally with his most loyal supporters. Blackburn is expected to face Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen to replace Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who is retiring. The Tennessee campaign is among several races crucial to Trump\u2019s plans to maintain control of the Senate, where Republicans are defending a narrow two-seat majority. Trump is planning a series of political rallies and events in the coming months to boost Republicans and brand Democrats as obstructionists to his agenda.\u201d Montana Senate race gets boost from outside cash - AP: \u201cOutside money is pouring into Montana\u2019s U.S. Senate race even before Republicans settle on a nominee to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, who has become a leading target of the GOP after drawing the fury of President Donald Trump. Four Republicans are jockeying for a last-minute advantage ahead of the June 5 primary. Their ambitions to topple the two-term incumbent were buoyed after Trump \u2014 who won in Montana by 20 percentage points \u2014 unloaded on Tester for releasing allegations that the president\u2019s pick for head of the Department of Veterans Affairs loosely handed out prescription drugs and got drunk on duty. Among Tester\u2019s would-be challengers, state auditor Matt Rosendale has emerged as the favorite of deep-pocketed conservative donors. Outside groups including two bankrolled by Illinois billionaire Richard Uihlein have spent $1.8 million pumping Rosendale\u2019s candidacy. That\u2019s almost twice as much as he\u2019s raised himself.\u201d Vulnerable Dems say banking law is proof of their \u2018independence from Washington\u2019 - The Hill: \u201cThree vulnerable Senate Democrats hailing from states President Trump won in the 2016 election are touting their work on a new bipartisan banking law, portraying it as proof of their independence in Washington. Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Jon Tester (Mont.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.) co-authored the bipartisan legislation, signed by Trump on Thursday, that eases the regulatory oversight imposed on banks and credit unions by the Dodd-Frank Act. The senators say their bill is a prime example of their ability to work across party lines and solve problems, a message they are eager to bring back to voters in their home states. \u2026 Yet whether the law will turn into electoral gold remains to be seen. The banking industry remains deeply unpopular, and liberal activists have assailed the new law as a giveaway to the financial industry.\u201d Gov. Hogan releases first ad in reelection campaign - WaPo: \u201cGov. Larry Hogan released the first television advertisement of his reelection campaign Monday, part of a $1.3\u00a0million advertising blitz ahead of the gubernatorial primary that is costing substantially more than some of his leading Democratic opponents have in the bank. With four weeks until the June 26 primary, Hogan and Lt. Gov. Boyd K. Rutherford have\u00a0$9 million\u00a0cash on hand and no Republican primary opponents. Their first television ad, which will air on broadcast and cable stations, highlights Hogan\u2019s record on the economy and environmental issues, including efforts to improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay.\u201d Millennial midterm candidates starting strong - Politico: \u201c[Colin Allred] \u2014 the newly minted Democratic nominee for a competitive House seat [in Dallas]\u2014 is part of a swell of young Democratic House candidates hoping to inspire higher turnout among fellow millennials in the midterm elections\u2026 At least 20 millennial Democratic candidates are running in battleground districts\u2026 Currently, the average age of a member of 115th Congress \u2014 nearly 58 years old in the House and nearly 62 years old in the Senate \u2014 is among the oldest of any Congress in recent history\u2026 [Elise Stefanik] was first elected at age 30. No woman has ever been elected to Congress in her 20s, but two 20-something Democrats \u2014 Sara Jacobs in Southern California and Abby Finkenauer in eastern Iowa \u2014 are serious contenders running in competitive districts. Illinois' Lauren Underwood, 31, and Ohio's Aftab Pureval, 35, have already won primaries to take on sitting GOP incumbents this fall. BIPARTISAN LAWMAKERS IN TALKS TO REVIVE DACA BILLPolitico: \u201cA group of senators in both parties is beginning to restart back-channel talks across the aisle and with the White House in hopes that the chamber will be ready to act if the House or the courts throw the issue back to the Senate this summer. But the Senate isn\u2019t ready to take up the issue after a thoroughly unproductive immigration debate in February, followed by months of radio silence. And lawmakers are growing more and more worried the upper chamber could be blindsided by a call to action later this year. The House, meanwhile, has become a hotbed of immigration debate \u2014 and it\u2019s preparing to take up one or several Republican bills in June. But even if the GOP is able to resolve its intense disagreements and pass something, the Senate is very unlikely to accept it, according to interviews with nearly a dozen senators of both parties.\u201d Report: DHS official says immigrant children aren\u2019t lost, they \u2018can\u2019t be reached\u2019 - \u00a0CNN: \u201cA top official at the US Department of Health and Human Services on Monday called reports that the agency has lost nearly 1,500 immigrant children false and misleading. The children are not lost, HHS Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan said in a statement. Their sponsors simply have not responded to follow-up calls from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), the HHS department that oversees the care of unaccompanied alien or minor children. The agency was under no obligation to make the 30-day follow-up calls to ensure that the children and their sponsors needed no additional services, he said. Now, this voluntary action is being used to confuse and spread misinformation, he said. \u2026 \u2018While there are many possible reasons for this, in many cases sponsors cannot be reached because they themselves are illegal aliens and do not want to be reached by federal authorities,\u2019 he continued.\u201d Nielsen goes against the boss on sanctuary cities - McClatchy: \u201c[Trump\u2019s] embattled homeland security secretary recently awarded nearly $1.7 billion in grants, some related to immigration, to states and localities across the nation, including so-called sanctuary cities, according to three people with knowledge of the grants. Kirstjen Nielsen authorized the grants despite objections of her top staff\u2026 Homeland Security officials said Tuesday that Nielson was bound by a nationwide court order that instructs the federal government not to withhold funding. Despite that, her top aides urged her in the day leading up to the awarding of the grants not to include the money for sanctuary cities, according to the three people, two of whom used to work at the department and remain in close contact with employees. \u2026 \u2018She is known for deliberately ignoring warnings that her decisions are not in keeping with the president\u2019s agenda, but that she proceeds forcefully and simply misrepresents what she is doing.\u2019\u201d TRUMP ACCUSES MUELLER'S DEMS OF MEDDLING Fox News: \u201cPresident Trump warned Tuesday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the \u201813 Angry Democrats\u2019 on his team \u2018will be MEDDLING\u2019 in the midterms by pursuing their Russia probe so close to the election. The special counsel reportedly is expected to lie low going into the midterms if the probe has not wrapped up by that point, so as not to be seen as swaying voters. But in a Tuesday morning tweetstorm, the president effectively argued that the probe is already threatening to interfere in the vote -- and questioned again why the team is not investigating \u2018totally Crooked Hillary Clinton\u2019 and Democrats. \u2026 The president was referring to the 13 investigators -- of the 17 total members on Mueller\u2019s team -- who have registered as Democrats. At least nine have donated to Democratic candidates and causes. Mueller, though, is said to be a lifelong Republican and served as FBI director under former Republican President George W. Bush.\u201d Michael Avenatti creating complications in Cohen probe - WSJ: \u201cA lawyer for former adult-film star Stephanie Clifford has frustrated efforts by federal prosecutors to obtain information about a hush-money deal involving President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, according to people familiar with the matter. In public, Michael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford\u2019s current attorney, has been among the most vocal critics of Michael Cohen, the lawyer who paid her $130,000 in October 2016 to sign a nondisclosure agreement about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. But behind the scenes, Mr. Avenatti has slowed prosecutors\u2019 efforts to discuss the nondisclosure agreement with Ms. Clifford\u2019s former lawyer, these people say. Mr. Avenatti also demanded to review documents investigators subpoenaed from Ms. Clifford\u2019s former manager, they said.\u201d PLAY-BY-PLAYSupreme Court allows Arkansas to enforce anti-abortion pill law - Fox NewsTrump mocks Dem Rep.

BRO\u2026 BBC: \u201cA man had to be rescued by police and the fire service after getting stuck in a child's swing in a play park. The 20-year-old had been firmly wedged in the child-sized seat for three hours before police were called to Landseer Park in Ipswich [England] at 07:50 BST. When a \u2018shove and pull\u2019 method of swing-release failed, the fire service arrived with a trusty screwdriver. The swing was taken apart and the \u2018grateful but embarrassed\u2019 grown-up was freed unharmed. A Suffolk police community support officer quickly realized the man - who complained he had been in there for three hours - was definitely stuck. There was no shifting him as the girth of his rear was clearly too wide for the child-sized swing.

            "article_content": " Every time members of the elite media mention the \u201cblue wave\u201d that is supposedly coming in the Nov. 6 congressional elections, they seem more and more delusional. In fact, as the elections draw closer, Republican victories are looking much more likely. In December, it seemed plausible that Democrats would make gains \u2013 the opposition party often grows in the first midterm elections of a new presidency. The polls at the end of 2017 also supported the idea. It made sense that the elite media would pick up the \u201cblue wave\u201d theory as a continuation of the reflexive anti-Trump narrative they had touted throughout Trump\u2019s candidacy and first year in office. However, the \u201cblue wave\u201d storyline was created before many of the benefits of the Trump-Republican agenda began to take hold, and it\u2019s going to be increasingly difficult to convince Americans their lives aren\u2019t getting better. The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, combined with President Trump\u2019s massive deregulation effort, has led to the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years (and the lowest black unemployment rate ever recorded). Wages are increasing, business and consumer confidence are soaring, and more and more Americans are starting to realize the huge disconnect between the America described by the mainstream media and the America in which they are living. The \u201cblue wave\u201d storyline was created before many of the benefits of the Trump-Republican agenda began to take hold, and it\u2019s going to be increasingly difficult to convince Americans their lives aren\u2019t getting better. Remember: When Republicans were debating the tax cuts, the elite media and the Democrats claimed working Americans would not benefit from the reduction of the corporate tax rate. They said the corporate tax cut was a giveaway to big business. However, as of Monday, 587 companies had announced \u201cpay raises, bonuses, 401(k) match increases, expansions, and utility rate reductions,\u201d as a result of the tax cuts, according to Americans for Tax Reform. Additionally, the media and the left claimed middle-class Americans would not benefit from the changes to the personal income tax brackets, yet most median-income families of four will save more than $2,000 in taxes starting this year. (This is what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called \u201ccrumbs.\u201d) As I write in my new book, \u201cTrump\u2019s America: The Truth About Our Nation\u2019s Great Comeback,\u201d the media are missing (or ignoring) a historic, positive period in our history. I say in my book: \u201cUnder President Trump, America is experiencing a great comeback. After nearly a decade of recession and tepid job creation, our economy is booming. In addition, ISIS has been effectively destroyed, illegal immigration is down, our military is being rebuilt, and our veterans are getting the health care and support they deserve. The administration is achieving success across a variety of sectors daily. \u201cPerhaps more important than these successes, however, is the reinvigoration of America\u2019s patriotic sense of self, which the rise of Donald Trump has awakened. Our country is being reconnected to our founding principles, the values that made America the greatest country in the world, and in doing so, is coming to understand just how destructive the last few decades of elite leadership have been to our freedom, prosperity, and safety.\u201d Much of the media\u2019s hostility to the Trump agenda stems from their contempt for President Trump himself. The elite media have always opposed him, and it has become a learned behavior. Reporters\u2019 shared inability to get over their own biases against the president further contrasts the media\u2019s portrayal of the nation and the public\u2019s perception. As I write in my book: \u201cTrump has had to fight the media on a daily basis because its members are overwhelmingly, bitterly, and actively opposed to him. In fact, the media has reached a point where attacking the president is the default action \u2013 no matter what the story is about. It has become muscle memory for reporters, anchors, editors, and producers to go on the offensive. \u201cYes, President Trump uses strong, sometimes harsh, language when dealing with his opponents (including the media). I am never surprised by the hostile back-and-forth over the president\u2019s words and the media\u2019s hurt feelings. Yes, the president, as a businessman in politics, doesn\u2019t speak or act like a typical politician. After more than two years of getting to know him, you would think the media would be used to this by now. Still, they fill airwaves and news pages with panicked outrage anytime President Trump describes a domestic or foreign issue in blunt, realistic, or indelicate terms. \u201cClearly, the media is having a hard time adjusting to President Trump\u2019s everyday behavior. To give them the benefit of the doubt, he is a unique commander in chief. However, it is astonishing to see the complete disconnect between the mainstream media and reality when it comes to the substance and outcomes of President Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d I have no doubt the elite media and the left will continue to prop up their \u201cblue wave\u201d message and keep attacking President Trump and Republicans at every opportunity. However, this will only widen the gap between them and the rest of the country. When Americans go to the polls Nov. 6, I suspect the \u201cblue wave\u201d will break against the great comeback.",

            "article_content": " The apparent pipe bombs sent to a variety of prominent Democrats have received huge media attention in the past few days and rightly so. The whole thing is horrifying. But they are not isolated acts. Political terrorism suddenly seems like part of the landscape of this country. Riots, vandalism threats, envelopes filled with white powder, physical attacks. Virtually every few days brings a new example of this in this latest case. In this latest case, the details remain sparse, but the reaction has been predictable and depressing. You've seen all the usual dumb people on television leveraging the moment to make scripted partisan points or boost their cable news ratings, as they invariably do. CNN blamed Trump for \"inciting a serial bomber.\" Jeff Zucker, head of that channel, tried to draw a connection between the president's dislike of the media and acts of terror. In other words, this is what happens when you criticize us. It went on like this all day with maximum self-righteousness. At a Trump rally on Wednesday night, the crowd shouted, \"Lock her up\" when he mentioned Hillary Clinton's name. All of it seemed normal. And in fact, it was. This is all normal now. Two parts of the same country that despise each other so much, that there's almost nothing one can't imagine the other doing, including encouraging acts of terrorism. This is ominous. We're not supposed to hate our fellow Americans this much. The question is how did we get here? And there are lots of reasons. Our leaders made a series of terrible decisions and never apologized for them. The middle-class died and nobody noticed. New technologies that were supposed to unite us, instead drove us farther apart. A rotten education system, disintegrating family, shocking rates of substance abuse, all of those played a role. There were other factors too. But more than anything, our thinking changed, that's what really happened. Over time, we stopped debating politics, issues and ideas and we started attacking each other for things we can't change for who we are. Take immigration, 20 years ago, we'd be arguing about how many migrants to admit into this country under what circumstances, whether or not it was all good for America, none of that is seriously under discussion today. Instead we get moments like these where people publicly say things like this: \u201cWhat is happening here is a sin against God.\u201d \u201cThe hypocrisy of all people of faith in our country, not to clamor for this -- for what the administration is doing to end.\u201d And Hillary Clinton speaks out and says, \u201cThose who selectively use the Bible to justify this cruelty are ignoring a central tenet of Christianity. Jesus said, suffer the little children unto me. He did not say let the children suffer.\u201d A sin against God. What you're hearing is not political debate, its theology. It's not based in reason, but in something deeper, something less predictable and more ferocious. It's a religious argument. Those are not resolvable, that's why you were told not to start them at the dinner table. Religious disputes push people into extremism. If I think your ideas are wrong, I'm happy to argue with you about them. But if I decide you're evil, I may be tempted to hurt you, if only in self-defense. Politics like this isn't really politics. It's sectarianism and ultimately it's an incitement to violence. Months ago we invited Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas onto this show to discuss whether the United States should provide free health care to illegal aliens. Now there are two sides to that question -- there always are two sides to political questions. But O'Rourke couldn't even see the other side. He saw only callousness and sin. Beto O'Rourke is not stupid, but like so many in our political class, he has adopted a habit of mind that leaves no room for legitimate disagreement with his own views. If you're opposed to paying for health care for illegal aliens, you're in favor of watching people die. You're morally\u00a0corrupt. Why would anyone waste time trying to reason with a monster like that? Would you debate human rights with Idi Amin, of course you wouldn't? You already know where he stands, because you know what sort of person Idi Amin is. Facts are irrelevant. His character and motives are all that matter. And increasingly that's what we argue about: character and motive. Here\u2019s anexcerpt from an\u00a0exchange I had with Congressman Adam Schiff of California. The question we raised was whether we know conclusively that the Russian government hacked John Podesta's e-mail account during the 2016 election. Schiff happens to be one of the few people who might know the answer to that. He's the Ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Here\u2019s how our conversation went: CARLSON: Can you look right into the camera and say I know for a fact the\u00a0government ofVladimir Putin was behind the hacks of John Podesta's\u00a0e-mail? REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA'S 28TH DISTRICT: Absolutely. The\u00a0government of Vladimir Putin was behind the hacks of our institution and dumping of information-- CARLSON: Of John Podesta's e-mail? SCHIFF: Not only in the United States-- CARLSON: Of John Podesta's e-mail? SCHIFF: --but also in Europe. CARLSON: OK. You're not. You know what, you're dodging the question. SCHIFF: Tucker-- CARLSON: Look and say, I know they did John Podesta's e-mails, they hacked\u00a0those. SCHIFF: And I think that Ronald Reagan will be rolling over in his grave-- CARLSON: You can't say -- now, Ronald Reagan finally-- SCHIFF: You are carrying water for the Kremlin. CARLSON: I'm not carrying water for -- I'm not-- SCHIFF: What you-- CARLSON: You're making -- look, you're sitting member of Congress on the Intel\u00a0Committee and you can't say they hacked-- SCHIFF: You're going to have to move your shoulder to RT, Russian televisions, because-- In other words, Schiff replied, I don't care what you're asking. The question is why you're asking it. And the answer, of course, is because you are a bad person. In this case a traitor to your country. Increasingly most political conversations look like this. When we want to defeat someone we disagree with, we no longer argue against what they believe. We wait until they make a mistake, until they say something stupid, even unintentionally, and then we pounce. We don't consider their explanation. We refuse to accept their apologies. There is no forgiveness. The point is not to make things right or to improve anything, the point is to vanquish an enemy. Now it should be said, it's not just Democrats who do this though, obviously, they do lead the category, \"Lock her up\", that's not something any politician can do or should do -- even to Hillary Clinton. Criminal guilt is for courts and judges to decide. It has to be. And what about this, the Reverend John Kasich -- he's also the Republican Governor\u00a0of Ohio. Here\u2019s how he explains that when you disagree with him, you are really disagreeing with God. \u201cWe've got to start putting ourselves in the shoes of other people. We've got to start thinking about the consequences that others suffer. And if we've been spared those by the grace of God, let us be appreciative, let us count our blessings and let us reach out to those who have less. \u2026 And let's stop putting up walls around ourselves and not understanding the plight, the trouble and the problems of others. It is not right and the Lord doesn't want it. And our people at their hearts, want to reach out to others. \u2026 Look at what they do in these storms. They go and they rescue people they don't know. They put them in their homes. They feed them, that's America.\u201d \u201cThe Lord doesn't want it,\u201d says Pastor Kasich. Well, maybe Father Kasich is right, it's really hard to know. What's easy to know and to foresee is what happens to a country where the people in power claim moral authority they don't have in order to compel you to obey. What happens is that resentment builds, factions form, craziness starts to seem normal. It is all bad. And if you want to fix it, stop talking like this.

            "article_content": "President Trump calls The New York Times 'gutless' for publishing an anonymous op-ed reportedly from a senior administration official who claims individuals inside the White House are working to thwart the president; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. If you\u2019ve been living your life rather than following the latest circus in Washington, you may have missed the fact that the Swamp\u2019s chief scribe has a new book coming out. Or maybe you're unaware that some anonymous, arrogant Trump administration staffer who no one voted for has written in The New York Times about how he or she feels entitled to overrule a president elected by the American people according to the Constitution. It turns out Bob Woodward doesn\u2019t have a flattering view of President Trump. It also turns out that there really is a deep state conspiracy to thwart President Trump's agenda, organized by his own administration's appointees. Stop the presses! I think we knew that already. What's more illuminating than Woodward\u2019s gossipy, exploitative book or the pompous, self-important preening of a presidential aide is the D.C. media and political establishment's obsession with covering its own pathetic palace intrigue. It certainly reminds us of the very worst of Washington \u2013 the focus on style over substance, the personal over policy. But it\u2019s even more serious than that. Political appointees (or civil service bureaucrats, for that matter) who actually take pride in subverting the democratic will of the people exemplify the frightening authoritarianism we face at the hands of an entrenched ruling class determined to cling to power regardless of who wins actual elections. It is a ruling class, moreover, entirely funded by taxpayers for whom it shows constant and complete contempt. What this week reveals is that the Washington elites have gone mad. They have not only lost touch with the real life struggles of the working men and women of America whom they despise. This insider club, comprised of people in both parties and the Beltway establishment, has become so isolated from reality that it ignores substantive results \u2013 whether that\u2019s economic progress or foreign policy successes like the cowing of ISIS \u2013 and instead celebrates the most self-regarding and insignificant people, touting them as headline newsmakers and brave truth-tellers who can enlighten the benighted masses. President Trump was elected to sweep all of this away, to enact big changes on behalf of the American middle class who perceived, correctly, that for years it did not matter who they voted for, the same people would be in power. And with the same results, namely: the rich and well-connected get richer, while working Americans see their communities collapse, their incomes go down and their jobs go away. But now the president also risks being consumed in the shallow Washington obsession with anonymous briefings, leaks and tweets. He risks losing sight of why he was sent to the White House in the first place. The outsiders who elevated Donald Trump to the highest office want him to turn the populist message of his 2016 campaign into a governing agenda that delivers beyond just the economic revival we have seen. It\u2019s obvious that the president can\u2019t count on the Republican Party in that mission: the GOP seems to have simply ignored the 2016 election and treated it, bizarrely, as a license to perpetuate the crony corporate conservatism that voters explicitly rejected in the primaries. Meanwhile, on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue there\u2019s another circus in town: the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee. With red-hooded handmaidens and shrieking outbursts, the spectacle has descended into farce with constant interruptions by juvenile activists who, with the blessings and coordination of Senate Democratic leadership, think it appropriate to turn the hallowed offices of the world's most important deliberative body into the University of California, Berkeley campus. Insanely, the media elites even tried to smear one of Kavanaugh\u2019s staffers as a white nationalist by falsely claiming she flashed the \"white power\" symbol with her hands. Weren't these the same people who just last weekend were lecturing us during Sen. John McCain's memorial service that we ought to be more civil to each other? President Trump, I say this as one of the earliest advocates of the populist revolution: your presidency is at an inflection point. You can continue to play the Swamp creatures at their own game, or you can go over their heads (tails?) and enact a genuinely revolutionary populist program that will reassure your voters, and perhaps even some of your skeptics, that you stand on the side of working Americans. Frankly, your re-election depends on it. Fortunately, Mr. President, if the Bob Woodward book tell us anything new, it is that your instincts are correct. Too many of your advisers have seen their job as preventing you from delivering on your promises. Former economic adviser Gary Cohn was clearly one of Woodward\u2019s sources and recounts with great pride his \u201cpurposeful\u201d effort to \u201cblock some of what (he) believed were the president\u2019s most dangerous impulses.\u201d Hilariously, the Goldman Sachs veteran is now being lionized by the left for his efforts to protect the profits of the super-rich by blocking President Trump\u2019s plans to protect American workers. Good riddance to Cohn and all the other elitists who put their interests first. When the president identifies the weasel who wrote with such gleeful disloyalty in the pages of The New York Times about being \"part of the resistance\" from within the White House, he should show him or her the door too. In fact, President Trump should make a public example of that disgrace of a public servant working for the duly elected president of the United States. It\u2019s little wonder that the bold agenda for change that propelled Donald Trump to the White House has barely been delivered. Thankfully, there\u2019s another book out there that offers genuinely transformative solutions to our long-standing problems. A book with answers about how we can restore economic security and opportunity for all American workers, how we can rebuild family and community, how we can finally and comprehensively Drain the Swamp. It could be a blueprint for the rest of the Trump presidency and a surefire way to win re-election in November 2020. It\u2019s my new book, \u201cPositive Populism,\u201d setting out 27 big ideas for delivering the positive promise of populism \u2013 and I can highly recommend it!",

            "article_content": "Karl Marx is being celebrated by Chinese President Xi Jinping as the \u201cgreatest thinker of modern times.\u201d Western academics are celebrating Marx as a historic critic of the modern world. Yet what all the pro-Marxist, pro-socialist speakers ignore is the human cost of Marxism. In the name of Marx, Vladimir Lenin established the Soviet Union as police state that killed millions. Josef Stalin succeeded Lenin as the Soviet leader and proved even more ruthless and committed to killing. Adolf Hitler led the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 (Nazi) Party and socialism was central to his taking over the German economy and the German state \u2013 a fact the left makes every effort to avoid. Mao Zedong was the deadliest Marxist of all and killed an uncounted number of millions to impose his will on China. Fidel Castro turned a prosperous Cuba into a tragic police state in the name of Marxism-Leninism. And Venezuela has been shattered by socialism. The academic left and its news media and Hollywood acolytes refuse to confront the horrifying record of Marxism\u2019s endless inhumanity. This would be a good year to begin educating all those who have been lied to as a result of the American academic infatuation with Marxism. We need a TV series on Marxism (and its evolution through Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, Castroism, etc.) so that Americans can come to grips with the horrors of centralized government and the cost of tyranny. The desire of those with power to get more and more power seems insatiable. Our Founding Fathers understood this and designed the Constitution to distribute power so no one person could establish a dictatorship. American exceptionalism is the opposite of Leninism. Lenin used Marx\u2019s analysis and rhetoric to justify establishing a secret police-controlled totalitarian system. Within a remarkably few years, he had centralized authority and begun to lock up, torture and kill his critics. When Lenin died, Stalin took his system of centralized power and refined it with even more brutality. Literally millions were starved to death as a matter of policy to break the middle-class farmers. As an example of the grip Marxism had on the American news media and intellectuals at the time, The New York Times reporter in Moscow conspired with other reporters to avoid covering the famine and the mass deaths. Diana West\u2019s book \u201cAmerican Betrayal\u201d cites the evidence of this deliberate coverup. Left-wing American academics have always had a soft spot for Marxist regimes. One of the most widely read economic textbook writers and the first American to win a Nobel Prize in economics, Paul Samuelson, told college students in the 1961 edition of his best-selling \u201cEconomics: An Introductory Analysis\u201d textbook, that the Soviet Union\u2019s economy was growing faster than the U.S. economy (never true). This incorrect information continued to appear in subsequent editions of the textbook for more than two decades. Today the left argues that Marxism didn\u2019t fail in the Soviet Union \u2013 only the way the Russians tried to implement it failed. In fact, I was told by someone who was at a dinner with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and a group of academics that when one of them made that argument Gorbachev responded: \u201cYou would have to be an American professor to believe that.\u201d Hitler studied the Lenin-Stalin police state and modeled much of his own totalitarianism on their design. There was a lot of the KGB in the design of the Gestapo. The central power of the state and its authority over people was central to Lenin, Stalin, Hitler and Mao. The individual human disappeared in the search for historic power and control. We are about to witness a fascinating experiment in whether combining Marxism with big data can work. Xi Jinping is implementing a system by which Chinese people are heavily surveilled and assigned citizenship ratings based on their social media activity, patriotism, productivity, fitness routines and other behaviors. Those with low scores can be barred from commercial flights, some trains, and from having their children enrolled in some schools. Deng Xiaoping saved the Chinese communists from popular rejection by advocating a system of free enterprise within the communist structure after Mao\u2019s death. He argued that unless the Chinese economy was dramatically improved, China would not prosper. Further, he understood that if the system didn\u2019t reward the Chinese people, there would be a widespread rejection of the Communist Party. In his famous Southern Tour of China in January and February of 1992, Deng made the case for free markets in which productivity \u2013 not politics \u2013 decided winners and losers. Now Xi Jinping is reversing the market-oriented decentralization of Deng. As he made clear in his recent speech on Marx (have your web browser translate it), he regards Marx \u2013 not 18th century Scottish economist Adam Smith \u2013 as the central guide for China\u2019s future. If indeed Marxism has defeated Deng Xiaoping in the corridors of Chinese power, we are in for a terrible experiment in tyranny. I wrote about President Xi Jinping\u2019s aggressive power gathering in China, in my new book, \u201cTrump\u2019s America: The Truth About Our Nation\u2019s Great Comeback.\u201d I will doubtless write more on this in future columns, but for the moment, simply note that no experiment in Marxism has come out well. Centralized control leads people to lie and cheat. Lying and cheating leads to the leadership demanding more secret police with more rules and more punishment. The system becomes a downward spiral in which humans are sacrificed to the power of the few. This is Marx\u2019s legacy. President Xi should study it carefully before taking China off the path of economic growth and onto the path of tyrannical growth.",

            "article_content": "Republican Peter Flores wins historic Texas Senate special election in a district Hillary Clinton won by 12 percent. In a stunning turn of events, Republicans reclaimed a Texas state Senate seat Tuesday not won since 1878. After 139 years of Democratic control, Republican Pete Flores made history when he carried Senate District 19 by 6 points \u2013 reversing the trend in a district that voted for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by a 12-point margin. The GOP\u2019s unexpected victory in a runoff election shows that when Republicans turn out, we can defy the blue wave that Democrats say is on the horizon \u2013 not just in Texas, but in close races across the country. Flores defeated Democrat Pete Gallego and will now replace Democratic Sen. Carols Uresti, who resigned. Uresti was convicted of helping an oilfield service company he co-owned run a Ponzi scheme. In addition to ensuring that Republicans have a supermajority in the Texas Senate, Flores\u2019 victory also has national implications. The state Senate district covers 80 percent of the 23rd Congressional District in Texas \u2013 one of the 66 competitive House seats that Cook Political Reports rates are in play. The GOP state Senate victory spells good news for Republican U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, who is defending his 23rd Congressional District seat against Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones. The state Senate victory comes just days after a recent poll showed Hurd leading his liberal opponent by 8 percent, thus jeopardizing what Democrats hoped would be a pick-up opportunity. The outcome of the race for the Texas Senate seat also highlights a national trend that should be worrisome for Democrats. Hispanic voters are increasingly shifting toward the Republican Party. Flores is now the first Hispanic Republican to be elected to the Texas Senate, prevailing in a district that is 66 percent Hispanic. This should come as no surprise. given that the Hispanic community is winning in the Trump economy. Hispanic unemployment has hit a historic low, and Hispanic household income grew 3.7 percent, adjusted for inflation \u2013 \u201cmore than double the increase seen by all households,\u201d Alfredo Ortiz noted in The Hill. Amid a flourishing economy, President Trump\u2019s approval rating among Hispanic voters grew 10 in just one month! The good news for Republicans is that the Texas Senate victory did not come in a vacuum. Recent polling shows Democratic U.S. senators in nail-biter races in Indiana, North Dakota, Missouri, Minnesota, and even deeply blue New Jersey. A Fox News poll published last week showed Republican Senate nominee Mike Braun leading Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in Indiana by 2 percent, after closing a once 12-point gap. That same poll shows Republican North Dakota Senate nominee Kevin Cramer leading Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp by 4 points, mirroring a similar poll taken in June. Meanwhile, in Missouri, Republican challenger Josh Hawley leads Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill by 3 percent in the recent Trafalgar Group poll, while tying her in several others. Perhaps most shocking of all, though, are the astonishing numbers emerging from the New Jersey U.S. Senate race, where Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez finds himself in close race after emerging from a tough trial on corruption charges. Shockingly, in the most recent three polls Menendez leads Republican challenger Bob Hugin by single-digit margins, besting him by just 2 percent in the July Gravis poll in a state that Hillary Clinton won by 14 points. This comes as a fourth prominent New Jersey Democrat, Branchville Mayor Tony Frato, threw his support behind Hugin. And in Minnesota, a state that Donald Trump narrowly lost in the 2016 presidential race, the Senate race for the remaining two years of former Sen. Al Franken\u2019s term is far closer than expected, with Republican nominee Karin Housley trailing Democratic Sen. Tina Smith by just 7 points. These encouraging numbers come in the face of a challenging landscape for Republicans, where the odds are set against us. Since the Civil War, the party controlling the White House has lost House seats in all but three midterm elections. \u00a0This is why, as Republicans, we have one huge task before us: defy history. In close races, the groundwork we have laid at the Republican National Committee can make the difference. Our quarter-billion dollar data operation that President Trump used to prevail in 2016 is widely regarded as the best in the business, as noted by even Hillary Clinton. And we\u2019ve quadrupled the number of top-tier volunteers and have recruited tens of thousands of traditional volunteers, creating a ground operation the likes of which the party has never seen. Defying history is certainly possible, especially considering that the number of Americans who think the country is heading in the right direction is the highest in modern history. Complacency, though, risks destroying all the meaningful gains we have made in the last two years \u2013 a soaring economy, more health-care options, and needed fixes to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Taken together, the fate of Republicans in November will be determined by one sole metric: turnout. In the Texas Senate race Tuesday, the district saw \u201cthe largest percent increase in turnout from special election to a runoff\u201d in the past four years. In other words, Republicans turning out enabled our party to defy history. Republicans must understand the stakes: not voting means an end to the Trump agenda; the rise of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., to become speaker of the House again; and a reversal of the policies that fueled a soaring economy and put more money in the pockets of middle-class Americans.",

            "article_content": "Several Democratic House candidates have said they would not vote for Pelosi as speaker. Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer says both parties will set themselves up for 2020 after the midterms. Democratic Party kingpin Nancy Pelosi \u2013\u00a0the once and future Speaker of the House if Democrats retake the chamber on Tuesday \u2013foreshadowed just how radical her party\u2019s agenda will be. She wants to do to America what progressives have done to San Francisco. Speaking to cheering liberals at a fundraiser on Sunday, Pelosi seemed baffled that anyone would criticize what has become of the once-beautiful city: \u201cBut when they say San Francisco liberal, as if to make it sound like it\u2019s something negative, them\u2019s fighting words.\u201d More ominously, Pelosi promised \u201cBut San Francisco values, that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\u201d What exactly might those values entail? Lots of bums and poop apparently. San Francisco values have put the town at the forefront of the urban decay that affects most major cities, especially those on the West Coast.\u00a0 The place is literally awash in human waste, with the new mayor observing, \u201cI will say there is more feces on the sidewalks than I\u2019ve ever seen growing up here.\u201d A U.C. Berkeley disease expert recently concluded that parts of the city were more unsanitary than foreign slums.\u00a0Local reporters surveyed some of the most popular parts of downtown with tourists and businesspeople and found 100 used drug needles and more than 300 piles of feces. The city is teaming with homeless, many of whom are drugged out of their minds, aggressive, or even violent.\u00a0Crime is on the rise, and even residents of the notoriously liberal city appear increasingly fed up. San Francisco also exhibits the failure of progressive economics.\u00a0By heavily taxing the middle class and creating so many regulatory impediments to building new homes, decent housing is increasingly beyond the reach for those Californians who aren\u2019t wealthy.\u00a0San Francisco has the greatest income inequality in America and it\u2019s getting worse. But Pelosi and her progressive friends are ever loyal to those San Francisco values, even amid their obvious and catastrophic failure.\u00a0Rather than arresting people who defecate or shoot up on the streets, San Francisco hired a five-person \u201cpoop patrol\u201d that somehow is costing the city $184,000 per employee per year. Rather that surmising that tough love might be better than throwing more benefits at the homeless, progressives want to tax more and spend more on services.\u00a0Oblivious to the fact that permissiveness and handouts attract more homeless, San Francisco has a ballot initiative to raise taxes on businesses \u2013\u00a0even ones that don\u2019t make a profit \u2013\u00a0and avail government of $300 million more to spend. San Francisco is also famously a sanctuary city.\u00a0It was there where Kate Steinle was shot by a pistol-wielding illegal alien who previously had been deported five times.\u00a0A jury in the city found the accused murderer not guilty, except on weapons charges.\u00a0 More recently, San Francisco decided to allow illegal aliens to vote in some local elections. This is the utopia that Pelosi and her wing of the Democratic Party, dominated by far-left progressives, have for the rest of America. In Pelosi\u2019s America, God help you if you\u2019re a middle-class family that wants to afford a home. God help you if you don\u2019t want your vote diluted by illegal immigrants who presumably can be counted on to vote for more progressive lawlessness. God help you if you don\u2019t want your kids to walk by piles of human waste, dirty needles, and aggressive bums. Pelosi has shown just how dedicated she and her party will be to hardcore progressivism.\u00a0There is not even a pretense that the Democrats will attempt to govern with moderation or reach across the aisle to try to work with Republicans.\u00a0Instead, a House of Representatives run by them will be a non-stop freak show of the same ideas and policies that ruined a once-beautiful city. As in San Francisco, Pelosi\u2019s America will be a great place for the super-rich and homeless.\u00a0For the rest of us, not so much.",

At least two people were killed and more than 40 were injured in New Jersey on Thursday after a school bus and dump truck collided on an interstate, leaving a mangled wreck in the middle of the highway, officials said. The crash occurred around 10:20 a.m. on Interstate 80 in Mount Olive, located about 50 miles west of New York City.\u00a0The front end of the bus, which had 38 students and 7 adults on board, appeared to be crushed or ripped off, and it was sheared off from its undercarriage.

A red dump truck with a mangled front end was parked along the highway nearby. The school bus had markings for the Paramus School District. A fifth grade class trip for East Brook Middle School was scheduled for Waterloo Village, a historic site about 5 miles away from the crash scene, according to the school's district's website.\u00a0Holly Tedesco, Paramus Council President, said at a brief news conference that fifth-graders on the two other buses heading to Waterloo Village have since returned to their respective schools.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Story,\" June 29, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: Hi there, Shannon. Thanks so much. So tonight, we take you live to Annapolis, Maryland where a vigil is about to get underway as a shaken community mourns the loss of these five people. And we learn chilling new details about the killer as police confirm that he barricaded the building's back door shooting at least one victim as they tried to get out. We have also learned tonight that the newspaper's former executive director, says this was not wholly unexpected. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS MARQUARDT, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR, CAPITAL GAZETTE: I took a photo of Mr. Ramos who I had never met. Brought to the front desk and said, be on -- be on a lookout for this guy. If he comes in, dial 911. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: The president's addressing the killings a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This attack shocked the conscience of our nation and filled our hearts with grief. Journalists like all Americans should be free from the fear of being violently attacked while doing their job. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Lea Gabrielle is live in Annapolis, Maryland where the vigil is getting underway tonight. Good evening, Lea. LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Martha. A judge in Annapolis ordered 38-year-old Jarrus -- Jarrod Ramos to be held in jail on five counts of first-degree murder, one for each of the five victims. Police say that he used a legally purchased pump-action shotgun to shoot out a glass entrance before going inside and killing four journalists and a sales assistant. Earlier today, the state's district attorney describing the scene inside that newsroom. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WES ADAMS, STATE'S ATTORNEY, ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY, MARYLAND: Mr. Ramos is alleged to have executed a brutal series of attacks on innocent victims. That evidence that suggested a coordinated attacks, the barricading of the back door, and the use of a tactical approach, and hunting down, and shooting the innocent victims in this case. GABRIELLE: Police say Ramos had not been cooperating today as they were trying to get answers for why. But we do know he had a long-standing dispute with the Capital Gazette that started back in 2011. That's when a columnist brought about a criminal harassment case against Ramos. He later sued the columnist, and the editor, and publisher for defamation, but his case was dismissed. The Capital says the former editor said, \"I remember telling our attorneys this is a guy who is going to come and shoot us.\" Three editors, a reporter, and a sales assistant were killed in the Thursday afternoon rampage. One of those was 65-year-old mother of four, Wendi Winters. Her daughter telling reporters today that she loved what she did. Listen. WINTERS GEIMER, DAUGHTER OF ANNAPOLIS VICTIM: Know that she really liked what she did and who she worked with. She loved her job, and she loved what she did, and she loved to tell stories. And this is far too soon to lose my mother. (END VIDEO CLIP) GABRIELLE: Well, the community has been coming together here in Annapolis today to show their solidary. The paper itself showing its resilience by putting out a paper reporting on its own tragedy. And Martha, there are a number of services, there are a number of vigils being held here in Annapolis tonight. One as you mentioned started right here by the Annapolis Mall just moments ago. MACCALLUM: Lea, thank you very much. We're going to keep all of them in our minds this evening. What a -- what a tough time for all of those families. The President as we mentioned, offered his support to the people of Annapolis earlier today. Shortly after that, this afternoon, he boarded Air Force One heading to their summer home in Bedminster, New Jersey this evening. Reports tonight, indicate that he is using this getaway to interview Supreme Court candidates. All as he celebrates the six-month anniversary of his historic tax cut plan. Also, rumors are swirling about his chief of staff potentially making an exit. Here to talk about, wow, what a week for the Trump White House in so many ways, Anthony Scaramucci, former White House communications director and founder of SkyBridge Capital. Where to begin? I mean that there is a lot that has happened this week. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: You know, my heart, your heart, and all of our hearts go out to the families been, it's just an unspeakable tragedy but same time, you have to admire the resilience of all of these people would actually put the paper out to. I mean, it's just an amazingly sad story but a lot of resilience there. MACCALLUM: Yes. Indeed it is. And then, you know, there's been so much discussion about journalism, and about fake news. It was a Reuters editor who had to issue an apology because he made a horrible remark initially after -- you know, citing some blame for the president which is just awful. I mean, before anybody even knew anything about the circumstances here, or so, I think that's kind of the world that we live in right now, unfortunately. SCARAMUCCI: Oh, I mean, it's the world we live in but I also think we have to try to figure out how we're going to reduce these shootings. And so, I mean, it's not even a left or right this decision anymore, it's just what are the right or wrong policies to put in place to see if we can get a reduction in these shootings. And so, you know for me it's obviously a mental health issue. If you look at the person and you look at what people were saying about the person, we just have to work on the signaling on this stuff and get it right. Because -- MACCALLUM: I mean -- I mean, when you have an editor who's given a picture to the security guy, there needs to be a way to draw a circle around that person and make sure that, that is -- that those red flags go up before something like this happens. SCARAMUCCI: And politicizing it, Martha, is not going to help the situation. I'll bring in the president into the orbit of the thing is not fair to the president, it's also not fair to the situation. And so, I'm glad that guy walked it back. MACCALLUM: Let's go to some of what happened this week. Obviously, news that a lot of people were not expecting. Judge -- Justice Anthony Kennedy stepping down from the bench. The president has now said that he's going to have his nominee ready by July 9, which is a week from Monday, it's a short time frame. He says he's got five people in mind, two of them are women. Do you know who he's going to pick? SCARAMUCCI: Yes, I don't 100 percent know who he's going to pick. I know, he -- the family seems to be close to a few of these guys. So, we'll have to see what happens. But the president picked a great jurist last time. Justice Gorsuch is a -- is a phenomenal jurist. He'll pick a phenomenal jurist this time. What I -- what I definitely think, people should just relax for a second and give him the opportunity to pick somebody before they start digging trenches again, you know. So, this sort of weird, you know. I was thinking about Justice Scalia, we're talking about him earlier today. He was 97-0, Justice Scalia was appointed to the Supreme Court. And so we're in a situation now where it goes right down the partisan lines, you had to go into the nuclear option for this situation. But in the meantime, if you think about the quality of the people that the president is going to pick from an interview, these are all exceptional Americans, exceptional people. And so, I just hope we can just dial it back a little on the -- on the polemics if you will. MACCALLUM: So, in terms of the White House, the chief of staff, yesterday he made comments. Basically, Kellyanne Conway came out. You know, we have no indication that John Kelly is considering leaving the White House. Tonight, it sounded like the president kind of opened that door a little bit to that possibility. SCARAMUCCI: Well, listen, I think it's ultimately the -- you know, the President's choice, and so, obviously, if Chief of Staff Kelly wants to leave, he can leave voluntarily but it's going to be up to the two of them. We can say they're speculate about that. But I mean, you know, what I -- MACCALLUM: Some are saying Hope Hicks, might come back? SCARAMUCCI: What I tell you, I'm not in love with, and I continue to say this, I'm not in love with the leaking. You know, the John Kelly deserves the opportunity to have that conversation with the president. MACCALLUM: Yes. SCARAMUCCI: And it deserves to stay inside of that circle. And so, I just find it ironic that every time something super-sensitive is happening, one way or the other, it ends up dispersing from the White House and this sort of ridiculous anonymous way. So, I'm not totally in love with that, to be honest. MACCALLUM: There's a lot of people there who like to talk, as you know. SCARAMUCCI: Yes, yes, anonymously. MACCALLUM: And that's what's happening here. SCARAMUCCI: Anonymously, they run out, they get their cell phone out of the -- out of the locker, and they run outside. And they -- and they like chitter chattering, and it's sort of not fair. And so, you know, I have had issues with General Kelly in the past. He's had issues, obviously, with me but I think he's owed the respect frankly, of having that conversation with the president. He's been a decorated veteran, he served this country well, and he should be able to leave gracefully. MACCALLUM: All right, I want to play something for you. Because there's - - watch the contrast between what President Trump, said yesterday when he was at Foxconn in Wisconsin. And what some of his critics are saying about what they hope will happen to the economy. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: America is open for business more than it has ever been open for business. Made in the USA, it's all happening, and it's happening very, very quickly. JON MEACHAM, AUTHOR, THE SOUL OF AMERICA: If a recession hits -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You think that's where he bottom falls out? MECHAM: I think so. BILL MAHER, HOST, \"REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER,\" HBO: I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point. And by the way, I'm hoping for it because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: Fabulous, right? Hoping for -- hoping for recession. Hoping for recession. SCARAMUCCI: So, I mean this is all a part of the derangement sooner the people talk about, OK, this is same thing that got the Reuters editor in trouble. They just severely just like the president. Some of it's more related to his style, it's really not related to the policies because I challenged, and I'm sure I'll get lit up on Twitter after I say this, but I challenge you to come up with one policy over the last 17 or 18 month that the president has promulgated. That he's led to a disruption in your life or a lower living standard, or some kind of disavow of your quality of life. And the answer is there hasn't been any. So, obviously, the economy does fall that will be an issue for all politicians and will be issued for all companies in America. And that'll be a lot of pain. So, I really wish that Bill didn't say that. Having said that, the very good news is the policies have been fantastic. The stimulus has been fantastic as relates to the tax cuts that they were celebrating earlier today. And I think, you're going to see maybe even a four and a half five percent print on GDP for the second quarter. And so the economist says SkyBridge think that we've got a very good accelerated quarterly growth going into the end of the year. MACCALLUM: And let's play this from the president, in the interview that he did with Maria. (CROSSTALK) SCARAMUCCI: So, they'll be wrong about that too, Martha. MACCALLUM: Just watch this, and you, a thought in it. SCARAMUCCI: Yes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because we've seen the impact to the economy. What do you want to see happen now? Does the economy need even more stimulus? Are you looking for a phase two tactics? TRUMP: We're doing a phase two. We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it'll be more of a middle class. We did have a lot for the middle class but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we're thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20. And then, for the most part, the rest of it would go right to the middle class. It's a great stimulus. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Which tax cut is he talking about there, 21 to 20? SCARAMUCCI: Yes, that -- that's the corporate tax cut. MACCALLUM: The corporate tax cut, 21 to 20. SCARAMUCCI: He is at 21 now, he's talking about possibly bringing it down to 20, which means it probably will happen. But here's the great thing about him, and this will ultimately be his legacy. He recognizes that he has to close the gap here in terms of income spread and helping middle-class families and lower-middle-class families on the campaign that was his pledge. And its policies like that that are free market-based in their orientation that are going to get that done more than any other policy. So, what happens from the left? (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Do you think that's an offset for some of the trade issues if you lower corporate tax rates a little bit further, is that an incentive for companies like Harley-Davidson, for example, to maybe change their mind? SCARAMUCCI: Yes, on the margin. But I think what's happening is they're jumping the gun on the president. They're miss sizing his negotiation strategy. And I think, he's asking them to be patient. Those allies of ours and also the Chinese know that the trade situation is unbalanced. And they know that he's using that as a cudgel to those towers to bring it down. And I would call on all corporations large and small to give the president a little bit of time to watch him work this thing the way he worked the North Korean situation. And so, for me, not by the end of the year, my guess is he's very close on NAFTA, he's very close on negotiating something with the E.U. And I think, it's going to be for good news for everybody. MACCALLUM: It's going to be a big week for Mexico too. Big election there. SCARAMUCCI: Happy fourth, by the way. MACCALLUM: Thank you very much. Happy fourth to you. Good to see you, thanks for coming in. SCARAMUCCI: Good to seeing you, too. MACCALLUM: So, coming up next, a heated political battle already brewing over the next Supreme Court justice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J., SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: This is perhaps in both of our lifetime the biggest shift possible in the court. This could be a moment as Donald Trump has said, \"Up and down I will put judges that will overturn ROE on the court. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Next, Jonathan Turley here on the brand new details of the president's plan to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy. And how far will some activists go to stop the president? Michael Moore suggesting that it might be time to put our bodies on the line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL MOORE, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER: When you read the paper every day or you watch the news, do you ever cry? I mean, do you ever cheer up? Do you ever -- does this ever happened to you? This happens to me now, every day. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: President Trump signaling in an interview that will air this weekend that he is not going to show his cards when it comes to a litmus test for his judge pick but the President telling reporters aboard Air Force One just a short while ago tonight that he does have a list of five people including two women who he is considering for the top -- for the nation's highest court. The President also saying today that he plans to name that nominee before he leaves for Europe on July the 10th so we do expect that we will hear something by July 9th. Here now Jonathan Turley, Constitutional Law Attorney, and Washington University -- George Washington University Law Professor. Good to see you tonight, sir. Big week. JONATHAN TURLEY, LAW PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY: Thanks, Martha. Yes. MACCALLUM: So tell me what you think. First of all, he spoke with Maria Bartiromo, the President did, and she asked him you know, are you going to want to know from this potential justice where they stand on Roe v. Wade and whether or not they would overturn. And he said he didn't think that he would get specific about that in his discussions with the potential justices. What do you think about that? TURLEY: Well, it's an element of circumspection and restraint which is reassuring in the President. He's often a guy who sort of plays poker with the cards faced outward and that can be a liability it has in the past. Here he's playing this very smart and not asking those type of litmus questions because if he does the witness will have to address that. The fact is there's lots of ways to figure out where someone is on an issue like Roe v. Wade. Many of the people on the list of 25 are very familiar to people in D.C. Many of them have come to conferences and their views are fairly well known so you don't have to ask the question. I think what the President also knows is that he promised to put two or more pro-life justices on the court. If this justice doesn't prove to be pro-life, it would -- it could come back to haunt him during the next presidential campaign and so I suspect -- I suspect this will be on his mind. MACCALLUM: Yes, I suspect it will too. A headline in Politico, The Optics Do Matter. President Trump nudge to pick a woman for the Supreme Court. He has said that two of the five that he's considering our women. Is that important or not? TURLEY: Well, I'm someone that has long criticized the selection of justices for the optics. I think they should be selected entirely on the basis of their intellectual contribution to the court. I testified at Neil Gorsuch at his confirmation hearing in the Senate and I testified in his favor because I believe that he's an intellectual the first order even if you disagree with his conclusions. That is, in fact, the model we should choose. It doesn't matter what sex or race or religion that person is. This is a court of nine. It is an honor to hold one of those seats and it shouldn't be given to you on optics. MACCALLUM: It certainly is. It should be based on qualifications and the way that you approach the Constitution and whether or not that matches up with the way the person who's nominating you to the president, in this case, it feels about it. July 9th, I mean, that that's a quick turnaround. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of political pressure here to get moving on this. TURLEY: Yes, this is a NASCAR pace. It is a very fast turnaround but look, the Republicans do not want to be Garland. I mean, they basically you know, invented that strategy. It worked very well for them. They're not going to hand it over to the Democrats. They're going to push a nominee through before the midterm elections. Now that means that there have to be careful because if you make a vetting mistake and you have to change horses, it doesn't give you a lot of time so that's why they're cutting this short. MACCALLUM: Like the Harriet Miers example. Jonathan Turley, always good to see you, sir. Thank you so much. TURLEY: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Coming up tonight. Kim Jong-un gave his word that the remains of U.S. servicemen killed in Korea would be sent home. These families are elated but they are still waiting and they want to know what's happening. But first, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand isn't sure that none of her fellow Democrats will vote for the President's picked for the court because they didn't last time or did they? Our Friday group captain Tom Shillue and Ed Henry coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOORE: When you read the paper every day or you watch the news, do you ever cry? I mean, do you ever cheer up? Do you ever -- does this has ever happened to you these days? STEPHEN COLBERT, COMEDIAN: Sure, of course. MOORE: Right. It happens to me now every day. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Sure of course. That was Michael Moore bemoaning the state of the country. He went on to say this about President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOORE: When are people going to get off the couch and when are we going to rise up? Trump is not going to leave. He plans to be reelected. He loves the term president for life. The only way that we're going to stop this is eventually we're all going to have to put our bodies on the line. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Wow, OK. Joining me now on that another hot topic say is my panel Tom Shillue host of \"The Tom Shillue Radio Show\" on Fox News Radio, Kat Timpf Fox News Contributor and our own Ed Henry, Chief National Correspondent. Tom, let me start with you. So he cries sometimes when he's watching the news. Well, you do too, right? TOM SHILLUE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: I do, definitely. MACCALLUM: You do sometimes cry. SHILLUE: I'm always crying. But he's telling me to get off the couch. Michael Moore is telling me to get off the couch. It's kind of weird. MACCALLUM: That's true. SHILLUE: But he's -- he says -- MACCALLUM: And he's admitting he was sitting on the couch watching news crying. SHILLUE: Yes, but he wants us to put our bodies on the line so Michael Moore, he wants bodies on the line, we need a wall. Am I the only one two or two together here? ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I felt like I knew where you going. MACCALLUM: There's a lot of images going through my head right now of Michael Moore on the couch putting his body on the line. Kat, what do you think? KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that if you are crying every day watching the news, then that is a you problem. That is not of the way things are going problem because I watch a lot of news and I manage to cry about other things rather than the news. I don't think we should be taking advice from somebody who is so irrationally emotional about nothing. Over and over again, a lot of these super anti-Trump people will say we need to rise up. This is awful. Everything's awful. It's the end of the world. And I keep waking up every morning with everything being kind of fine, sometimes even you know kind of nice. So I think that maybe he should take a bath, candles, relax. It could help me sometimes. SHILLUE: Candles are good. TIMPF: Candles, maybe you know, some fragrant because he's a little too high strong. MACCALLUM: Yes, I think -- I think you're onto something there. HENRY: I've been spending a lot of time, Martha, trying recently to touch with my emotions and it's been a long journey. I mean, what is going on in this country when people say this stuff? It's like I honestly think that on election night we saw those people at the Javits Center waiting for Hillary Clinton and they were crying. And the next day you had the people in the Obama administration in the Rose Garden waiting for President Obama to comment on election and they had these long faces and they were all -- they've spent a lot of Democrats a year and a half emoting about things and kicking Sarah Sanders out of a restaurant and doing kind of these ridiculous things. And I think this week it's funny that this interview with Michael Moore on Thursday, it's like things finally got real. Democrats just spent a year and a half on Russia and everything else. And when you had the Supreme Court decisions which showed actually a travel ban is going to stick, and oh by the way, Justice Kennedy is stepping down and President Trump is actually president. Even though you don't want to acknowledge it, it got real. MACCALLUM: That was the view of what Michael Moore said. You know, he said he plans on being president again. I was like, that's not how it works, you have to run. You have to be elected, not he plans on doing it again. TIMPF: It's generally how it works. MACCALLUM: (INAUDIBLE) another four years. I thought you know, he said he'd love to talk about being president for life. Unfortunately, that's not the way it works in this country. And often I just feel like I understand and I understood the tears on election night. It was shocked, right? Things did not go the way they thought it was going to go. But at some point there has to be an accounting for real changes, actual things that are happening and I think the situation at the border is a real situation. You can talk about whether or not you know it existed that in a similar way in the last administration. But some of these realities I think really came home to roost this week, especially with the Supreme Court decision. Kirsten Gillibrand is sure that all Democrats will vote against the new nominee just as they did last time with corsets. Watches this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CUOMO, HOST, CNN: Are you right that he didn't get one vote? Didn't he get three? Didn't he get Manchin? SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y.: He got no Democratic vote. CUOMO: He didn't get Manchin, Heitkamp? GILLIBRAND: He did not. They stood strong and they passed it with Republican votes. CUOMO: I thought he got three by the way. GILLIBRAND: Did he? You might be right, Chris, but I believe this Democratic caucus will stand together. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: She needs to look over at her aide there for a second. SHILLUE: We need a little -- MACCALLUM: Obviously not a (INAUDIBLE). SHILLUE: We needed the Jeopardy -- wrong. It was three. MACCALLUM: So I mean, now we're looking at collective outrage and a lot of plans to try to figure out some way to prevent this nominee from happening and yet it looks pretty difficult just you know -- again, you have to go back into fact land and look at how these things work and how it goes that they're going to have a tough time. SHILLUE: Yes, and it's sad. I mean, I think the President gets his picks. That's what happens. The President picks the -- unless there's something wrong with the person. I grew up -- when I was -- it was -- when I was in college, it was Bork and that was the big thing. That was the first big fight. And they've been fighting ever since. And you know, Clarence Thomas, it becomes this big thing. MACCALLUM: Kennedy was approved 97 to zero. SHILLUE: Yes. MACCALLUM: That will never happen again. (CROSSTALK) ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: And you know what? You know what year it was? Nineteen eighty-eight which was a presidential election year. So guess what. Both parties actually came together and said, you know what, Ronald Reagan found a way out, but he's president, and George H.W. Bush ended up winning. So maybe they thought he was going to get to shape the court. But you're right, you win, you get to shape the court and that was my point before. I think a lot of Democrats, a year and a half ago, didn't get that, like, this was real. And that Donald Trump was going to govern. MACCALLUM: It's sinking in. You know what else is sinking in, a bad reality as a result of a Jimmy John's delivery. OK? So this young woman thinks she's going to do something nice for her new boyfriend, they've only been dating for three months, she's going to send him Jimmy John's, because he's studying finals. Because she calls them and she goes, I live far away but I'm going to send over to him. So the delivery guy goes and delivers it. And when he gets there, he finds an unfortunate set of circumstances playing out in the home. And this is what she tweeted after. I promise I'll fill in the blanks. Let's take a look at the tweets. She says, \"I do want to thank Jimmy John's for their incredible service to their customers. Not many would do what that delivery driver did. And I'm grateful that he called me and was honest about the situation.\" So Tom, it turns out that when the guy delivered the sandwich there was some other girl at the apartment. SHILLUE: Yes. MACCALLUM: And her supposedly studying boyfriend for finals was boxers only at this point. SHILLUE: Yes, I know. MACCALLUM: And so the Jimmy John's delivery guy took it upon himself to call her. I think you better know. (CROSSTALK) SHILLUE: He is nark. MACCALLUM: I got to tell you. SHILLUE: He told about the cheating boyfriend. And I think it's great. I mean, this, you can't cheat on your girlfriend, especially, this woman, there's a think called guy code. Guys aren't supposed -- guys are supposed to stick together. I don't stick together with this guy. If you had a girlfriend who is sending you submarine sandwiches, you keep that girlfriend, you do not cheat on her. TIMPF: I wish there was Jimmy John's in New York City. Ever since I read this story, now all can I think about is Jimmy John's. There are no Jimmy John's. They bring you sandwiches and they tell you if your boyfriend is cheating on you. That's not a restaurant, that's like a best friend forever. MACCALLUM: The problem with this whole thing is that we are also used to infiltrated into other people's lives now. I think through social media and everything. And it's like, I know that person on Twitter, I know them on Facebook. You feel like you know everybody. This is none of your business. HENRY: Right. MACCALLUM: Mr. Delivery boy. Drop the sandwich, and leave. HENRY: It's like the Alexa device which I have couple of mine. That was the coolest thing. I started hearing, they're spying on you, they're listening to your conversations. MACCALLUM: Yes. HENRY: People push the wrong button and other people are hearing about it. By the way, there is a Jimmy John's like a block from the White House, I'm sorry you don't have it in New York. TIMPF: I really want Jimmy John's. HENRY: We go there sometimes between live shots. The tuna country club sandwich. SHILLUE: Great sandwiches. TIMPF: I don't have Jimmy John's around, or a boyfriend, so it's very sad. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: But you are not crying on the couch every day. TIMPF: But I'm not crying on the couch every day. MACCALLUM: You are OK. TIMPF: Yes. MACCALLUM: Thank you, guys. Good to see today. HENDY: Great. You, too. MACCALLUM: Happy 4th of July, have a great week. Coming up next, there is news breaking in the biggest sports scandal in the United States history. Texas prosecutors have now come to a decision about the Karolyis. Plus, these families have waited for the remains of their loved ones for 65 years. Now they're waiting for Kim Jong-un to make good on his word. Their story is next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: I am optimistic that we will begin to have two opportunities, one to receive some remains in the not too distant future. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: This is breaking tonight, there will be no charges for famed U.S. Gymnastics coaches Bela and Marta Karolyi. Texas prosecutors announcing today that they did not find wrongdoing by the couple in connection with the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal. Last May, some of Nassar's victims called on Texas officials to investigate why USA gymnastics coach Marta Karolyi knew what he knew -- what she knew, rather, about Nassar's abuse while they trained at the Karolyi ranch, the U.S. Olympic training center. The Karolyis have always maintained that they did not know what was going on. Today Texas prosecutors did file new charges of sexual abuse against Nassar who was already in prison on these charges for the rest of his life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POMPEO: I am optimistic that we will begin to have two opportunities, one is to receive some remains in the not too distant future. We're dogged in trying to facilitate this as quickly as we possibly can. SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN, D-N.H.: Thank you, I appreciate that. And just to be clear, we have not yet received any-- (CROSSTALK) POMPEO: That's correct, senator. We have not physically received them. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivering that update earlier this week. No remains of U.S. troops returned yet from North Korea. Around 7,700 U.S. troops are still unaccounted for from the Korean War. But Pompeo is optimistic about President Trump's agreement with Kim Jong-un to bring our nation's heroes home. And family members are still holding out hope that they will be reunited with their loved ones. Tonight we follow up with two of the families who joined us before. First lieutenant Robert Schmidt fought forward through the most brutal battle of the Korean War but sadly never returned. And Captain John Henry Zimmerlee went out on a night mission in Korea but his plane disappeared and only questions remained. Here, now, their family members still fighting to bring them home. Joan Morris is the niece of first lieutenant Robert Schmidt. And John Zimmerlee is the son of Captain John Henry Zimmerlee. Welcome back to both of you. It is good to have you back with us. We got so much feedback from your stories, and I think people want so much for you to have the circle closed on what this situation has brought to your families. Joan, let me start with you, just remind us, about your Uncle Bobby's service. JOAN MORRIS, NIECE OF KOREAN WAR VETERAN: Well, Uncle Bobby served in World War II for over three years. And then he came back to North Dakota and graduated with an ROTC degree and he became an army officer. And he was stationed in Japan, then he went to Korea. And he was killed at the children (Ph) reservoir on December 1, 1950. MACCALLUM: And John, your dad? JOHN ZIMMERLEE, SON OF KOREAN WAR VETERAN: Yes, so my father was an air force navigator, went out on a small plane on a night mission in March of 1952, he was on radio communication around 9 p.m. And that's the last we heard from him. No one knows whether they crashed into a mountain, whether they were shot down, whether they were taken captive. No one really knows. There are some documents that give us those hints that some of them may have been in captivity. But even that is not positive evidence. MACCALLUM: Joan, you know, obviously these are difficult circumstances and you heard Secretary Pompeo say that they are committed to bringing them back. And what we know about some of the graveyards that were used and some of the situations. How difficult do you think it will actually be to see this through? MORRIS: Well, I think it will be very difficult. One end, you're dealing with the North Korean government who, even though it's humanitarian type of issue. In the past has used the return of our soldier's remains as a bargaining chip with the United States. The other issue that I'm very worried about is the Department of Defense and their capabilities, their competent, and the overall direction that they're using as far as identifying the remains. And I say that, because some of the remains were returned over 20 years ago and still have not been identified. So the Department of Defense is not using updated DNA technology. They're using very expensive technology that takes four to five months for a test result to come in. Where, if they were using nuclear DNA technology the test results would come in within a week. They're 10 times less expensive than the DNA test that they're using now. And they have a higher degree of accuracy as far as identifying the particular soldiers. MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, John, you share that concern, I know. In terms of the response from the DOD and exactly where these remains are. And some of them are in U.S. territory. ZIMMERLEE: Yes. In fact, the DPAA announced today that they made an identification of a person who was of an unidentified remains, it's been buried in Hawaiian cemetery for 65 years. That remains was tentatively associated with this particular individual. It took them 60 years to even read the document. They dug him up four years ago from the cemetery. And just now, four years later, are identifying with the micro -- the mitochondrial DNA that Joan is referring to, which is really antiquated. MACCALLUM: Yes. Joan, you know, I think so much of this is about this war getting the respect that it deserves. Is that -- is that part of what drives you, in your mission for your family? ZIMMERLEE: Yes. (CROSSTALK) MORRIS: I don't think it's the-- ZIMMERLEE: Sorry. MACCALLUM: Joan and then John. Go ahead, Joan. MORRIS: I don't think it's the overall view of the war. I think it's a very personal type of issue for our family. My grandmother was very concerned about the fact that my uncle did not have a proper burial. And when she moved, she sent letters to the Department of Defense indicating her new address and was there any updates or anything like that. And so I think we take it personally, this is something that since that generation has gone, we're the ones that hopefully will be able to bring our Uncle Bobby home and have a proper burial. MACCALLUM: John, quick thoughts on that again. ZIMMERLEE: Yes, we feel that our government has not shared all of the information that they have with us over all these years. And now this is an opportunity for the media to put pressure on our government to release a lot of that information and a lot of the details on the remains. MACCALLUM: John, as you just said with your help. So we'll stay on your story, we hope you'll come back, and our thanks to both of you. Thank you very much for being here. MORRIS: Thank you. ZIMMERLEE: Thank you. MACCALLUM: A controversial conservative commentator Mona Charen is out with a new book. She says feminism got it all wrong, and she is telling women in America to wake up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MONA CHAREN, AUTHOR, \"SEX MATTERS\": The feminist movement really went wrong when it said that was the male model was the thing that women had to be. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right. CHAREN: And instead of saying, no, the female model is a great model. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: My next guest is no stranger to controversy, that was her speaking at C-PAC earlier this year. A couple of her comments even drew boos from the crowd that day. But that has not stopped Mona Charen from calling out what she sees as blatant hypocrisy in both parties. Tonight she has a new book that targets in part the Me Too movement and modern day feminism. She believes the movement has lost its way. Earlier this week, I sat down with Mona Charen, the author of \"Sex Matters: How Modern Feminism Lost Touch With Science, Love, and Common Sense.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: Fascinating. And, really, you're pushing back on some very, sort of uniformly accepted norms about how feminism is supposed to be empowering to women. CHAREN: It's supposed to be pro-woman. And in some ways it was. But the point of my book, feminism took a couple of really devastating wrong turns. One was in embracing the sexual revolution. And the other was in rejecting family life as a trap for women. And instead what we found, we've had 50 years now of experience with modern feminism. And what we've seen is families are disintegrating, women are struggling, single women are struggling to do everything themselves. Men are disconnected from their families and sometimes even from the workforce. It's time to rethink some of the assumptions that got us here. MACCALLUM: One of the things that you say, is that you see declining female happiness. CHAREN: Yes. It's really interesting. If you look at the general social survey, which they started asking questions in 1972, how happy are you, and what they noticed is that every year since, women have been less happy and men have gotten more happy. So if the feminist movement with all of its achievements were supposed to be the answer for women's happiness you wouldn't expect to see that men are now happier than women and women's happiness has steady declined. I think a lot of it is about how insecure modern women are. They don't have the structure of marriage, family, that security that women need because we are the ones who have babies and we do need to be taken care of when we're in those vulnerable stages of our lives. MACCALLUM: So you are you a very independent woman, you have had a big career. CHAREN: Right. MACCALLUM: Very successful career. You're married, you have children. Some people say that is difficult to have it all. CHAREN: Right. So, the line that I always repeated, is you can't have it all -- you can have it all but not all at once. And also, I kind of reject this whole notion of having it all. Because first of all, we don't know what it is, right. MACCALLUM: Right. CHAREN: It doesn't necessarily mean, you know, you have 2.5 kids and you got and X number of -- the huge income and a great career. It may mean having a fulfilled and happy and balanced life. And if that's your goal, then you definitely want to place family security right at the center of your life plan. Instead of something that you just hope will come along later. And that applies to men as well as women. MACCALLUM: All right. Very important to get to get to this question about the Me Too movement and how we got here. How did during the empowerment phase of women in this country, did we find ourselves falling prey to these awful situations with men? CHAREN: Right. So in some ways I actually think the Me Too movement is good, because I think it's women saying I have had enough, it's almost you could interpret it as a rejection of the sexual revolution that the feminist unwisely endorsed in the 1970s and since then. But the fact is, that by endorsing the sexual revolution and agreeing that we should just drop all of the old standards about how men should behave, what it meant to be a gentleman, that we kind of open the door to this kind of loutish, gross behavior that we have seen in so many men. And if women are pushing back against it, great. But they should understand the feminism bears some part of the responsibility for how we got here. That when they said, of course we don't want any particular sensitivity by men. We don't want you to hold doors. We don't want you to be gentlemen. That's condescending. Well, the result was, men didn't know how to behave. And some of them just defaulted to being jerks. MACCALLUM: What about, you know, dating and flirting and how difficult those things become now in this environment where men in some cases who don't want to get sucked into any of this kind of trouble feel like they just can't-- (CROSSTALK) CHAREN: Exactly. MACCALLUM: -- be themselves. Or you know, they have trouble knowing what the parameters are. CHAREN: Right. I think we actually need to return to some basic rules about behavior. One of them is, if you're married you absolutely shouldn't be looking or touching anybody who isn't your spouse. But also, you know, just basic things like so many of these women who came forward with the Me Too movement, were saying well, they went to Harvey Weinstein's hotel room for a business meeting. They didn't know that that's something you shouldn't do. Well, that should be just part of the rules. That there's never a reason for a male boss to ask a woman to come to his hotel room for a business meeting. And women should be empowered, really empowered, right, to say not happening. Not appropriate. MACCALLUM: Not happening. Exactly. CHAREN: Yes. MACCALLUM: To send that signal very clearly-- CHAREN: Yes. MACCALLUM: -- if you are interested in a professional relationship, and if that's not what this is, then that's it. CHAREN: Right. MACCALLUM: There's no -- you know, to put to lay down that marker. Mona, there's so much more to talk about. But I encourage everybody to read your book, it's fascinating, it's going to be controversial, no doubt, as you often are. And we're so glad you came here first. It's great to see you tonight. CHAREN: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Thank you very much for being here tonight. Good luck. CHAREN: Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: Our thanks to Mona Charen. So when we come back tonight, remembering the five victims of yesterday's shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Maryland. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Finally tonight we want to pay tribute to the five people killed in yesterday's attack at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Maryland. Despite the trauma and the loss, the small Annapolis paper put out an edition today. The victims have been identified as Rob Hiaason, an assistant editor and columnist. Wendi Winters, the special publications editor. Gerald Fischman, editorial page editor. Rebecca Smith, a sales assistant, and writer John McNamara. Inside the paper they left the opinion page blank. The editor writing only this, \"Today we are speechless. This page is intentionally left blank to commemorate the victims of yesterday's shooting at our office. Tomorrow this Capital page will return to its steady purpose of offering readers informed opinions about the world around them that they might be better citizens.\" Our thoughts and prayers are with the Capital Gazette staff and their families tonight.

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I am Laura Ingraham, and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. If you thought the midterm drama was over, well, you are in wrong. Shades of 2000 in Florida tonight as the state is mired once again in a recount drama.\u00a0\nGovernor Rick Scott just filed a lawsuit in the last few hours against Broward Palm Beach County, where votes are seemingly appearing out of nowhere, trunks of cars, you know, the bottom of your garbage disposal -- kind of an exaggeration, but not all that much, not all that far off. And Trump just responded and will speak to the attorneys on the ground in just moments.\u00a0\nPlus, Bernie Sanders is saying that Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams struggled to win votes because white voters were scared of them. Horace Cooper is here a little bit later on to respond. And why does President Trump's new acting attorney general Matt Whitaker bother so many of the resistance folks? We are going to examine it.\u00a0\nAnd we also speak to a good friend of hero, Sergeant Ron Helus, tragically one of the 12 senselessly killed in the Thousand Oaks shooting today in California, the last night in California this morning. But first, refusing to accept the agony of defeat, that is the focus of tonight's ANGLE.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Republican Brian Kemp has declared victory, says he will begin his transition to the governor's office today, but don't forget, his opponent, Stacey Abrams, she is not conceding yet.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: DeSantis has declared victory, Gillum has conceded, but he has tweeted saying that he wants every vote to count.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bill Nelson has brought in a high-powered Democratic lawyer from Washington, D.C., to oversee this recount.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIPS)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Well, in close or particularly contentious races, Democrats more so than Republicans seem to have a problem conceding defeat. Now, it can't be that the other guy won fair and square. It has to be that either the election system broke down or some mystery votes are hiding somewhere or the entire process must be tainted. Well then there is the other way to explain a tough loss, well, the voters must be racist.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump's instincts were validated in big sections of the country. The incitement strategy, the racial demagoguery, it worked.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump's Republican Party is getting increasingly older, increasingly wither, increasingly rural.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The other thing that could be happening in Florida is the Bradley effect, I mean, which once affected -- lowered the Election Day vote totals of black candidates. Former L.A. mayor Tom Bradley who kept running for governor and the polls would show that he would win and somehow on Election Day, he would lose.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: So mired in race. Even after Democrats flip to the House and many minority candidates won from coast-to-coast, once the result in the Florida's governor's race and in Georgia rolled in, Adam Serwer of \"The Atlantic\" published this piece. It was titled \"America's Problem Isn't Tribalism -- It's Racism.\"\u00a0\nAnd writing, \"If Republicans ran on their policy agenda alone, they would be at a disadvantage. So they have turned to a destructive politics of white identity, one that seeks the path of power by deliberately dividing the country along racial and sectarian lines. They portray the nation as the birthright of white, heterosexual Christians.\"\u00a0\nYes, Adam, that is what those policies that led to record unemployment for African-Americans and Latinos are all about, stoking racial and sectarian ethnic fears. It's absurd. The most despicable use of race in the midterms came from the Trump haters and some Democrats.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)\u00a0\nANDREW GILLUM, FLORIDA GUBERNATORIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE: Now, I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist. I'm simply saying the racists believe he is a racist.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sign me up in the category of the people who think he is racist. He has said so many racist things. He has done so many racist things. He is a racist pig!\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Making overtly bigoted, racist statements, attacking brown people, attacking black people.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIPS)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: When bizarre and suspicious racist robo-calls were reported in Florida, remember Republicans, including DeSantis and Rick Scott, immediately and vociferously denounce them, as they should. Back in 2016, the media tried to paint Trump as the one -- remember, he wasn't going to be accepting any of the results of the election.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: Are you saying you are not prepared now to commit to that principle?\u00a0\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time, I will keep you in suspense.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Well, Hillary responded to that like this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That is horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is it is rigged against him. That is not the way our democracy works. He is denigrating, he is talking down our democracy.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Talking down our democracy. Well, the media echoed Hillary, outraged that Trump would ever challenge the legitimacy of an election won fair and square. But all of their full moral outrage was exposed when Trump actually won in 2016. Suddenly our sacrosanct representative democracy -- it wasn't so sacrosanct after all.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, I rise today to discuss legislation I introduced to eliminate the Electoral College and ensure that the candidate who wins the most votes will be elected president.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Yes, the heck with the way the framers set it up, let's just dispense with it since we lost. Now, Republicans, even the president, of course they have their own hang-ups about legitimacy. Obama's birth certificate, which Trump himself focused on. But almost two years into the Trump a administration, many of the diehards -- after all, they are called the resistance -- still do not accept the results.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nREP. JOHN LEWIS, D\u2014GA.: I believe in trying to work with people -- it is going to be hard, it is going to be very difficult. I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My personal view is that it was not a legitimate election.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's your president.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is our president Angela. He is the president of the United --\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, not mine. Not mine. I'll never --\u00a0\nCLINTON: I think there are a lot of questions about his legitimacy, and we don't have a method for contesting that in our system.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: No wonder people are losing faith in our Democratic system. Listen to those people. Now, according to an Axios survey, just 51 percent of Americans said they have faith in the country's democracy. A whopping 37 percent, more than a third, say they have lost faith in it.\u00a0\nMy friends, this is really distressing for America's future. If the people decide the system is rotten, they are really saying the country is rotten. And soon they are going to be saying it isn't worth protecting anymore at all. But let's hope that we can turn this dynamic around, there is so much craziness out there.\u00a0\nAnd this means that both parties need to do better at focusing on issues, the issues the American people care about, instead of just a perpetual grievance, politics, it is getting old. Look, some recounts are mandated, and they are in Florida, and if the margins are close enough, Republicans and Democrats, they should both ensure that any recount is done fairly, no creating ballots where none existed.\u00a0\nNow, I got say, it was hardly reassuring to learn today that in Florida's most populous county, Broward, the elections chief there is a Democrat named Brenda Snipes. Well, Brenda was found guilty of violating state and federal law for destroying ballots in the 2016 congressional race when those ballots where, at the time, subject to a lawsuit.\u00a0\nAnd breaking in the last couple of hours, we had a lawsuit filed by Governor Rick Scott against Broward and Palm Beach County. Rightfully, he is going on the offensive against this entire shoddy practice. Republican lawyers, you better make sure that Democrats do not start torching absentee ballots in dumpsters in Boca, or finding other ballots other places.\u00a0\nLet's all just remember that while losing is never fun, and we remember our losses, believe me. We remember '92, we remember '96, we remember 2006 during the Bush midterms, 2008, 2012, it is never fun. But I will tell you, losing our Democratic process would be catastrophic. And that is \"The Angle.\"\u00a0\nJoining us now, three men who know this Florida issue better than pretty much most everyone in the country. Barry Richard is currently Andrew Gillum's attorney. He also represented George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida recount. Miguel De Grandy was also part of that Bush legal team, and Joseph Klock was attorney for Secretary of State Katherine Harris during that very same recount representing her against all of these legal challenges.\u00a0\nJoseph, I want to start with you tonight. Do you think it is wise for Governor Scott to move on the offensive, as I do, against Broward and Palm Beach counties, or is that premature?\u00a0\nJOSEPH KLOCK, ATTIORNEY: No, I don't think it is premature. You've got be -- you have to sort of stay ahead of the flow of what is going on. I think all of the -- I was not aware of the lawsuit until I drove over here tonight, but obviously what he wants to do is just to make sure that there is judicial supervision of what is going on, things don't happen that ought not happen.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Barry, I want to go to you. You are representing Andrew Gillum. He did concede the other night, but as you said earlier tonight, I heard you, you said well, that is not a contract. He thought the moment warranted a concession. But -- and your client and you say you are watching things very closely with the vote count. Last I checked, I think it was about 40,000 or so votes separating Gillum, of course, and Ron DeSantis. What are you looking at tonight?\u00a0\nBARRY RICHARD, ANDREW GILLUM'S ATTORNEY: There is a vast difference between 2000 and now. In 2000, our recounts were precipitated by the candidates who had to request them and got to select which counties they were in. The legislature as a result of 2000 has significantly changed Florida statutes.\u00a0\nSo, the candidates really have nothing to do with it now. If the margin between the candidates is less than one half a percent, it's an automatic so-called machine recount, where the ballots are sent through the machines again. If it is less than a quarter of a percent, then there is an automatic statewide manual recount.\u00a0\nAs far as Mr. Gillum is concerned, he is just waiting for the system to play itself out. This is part of the electoral process, it is part of the vote counting, and he will accept the results.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Miguel, I want to go to you. I think a lot of people watching across the country find it very odd this whole process of the vote count extending so many days. Explain to the viewers why that is, with provisional ballots, what those are, and moving into absentee, military count, which I understand in Florida have not been counted yet.\u00a0\nMIGEUL DE GRANDY, BUSH LEGAL TEAM in 2000 RECOUNT: Provisional and absentee -- and military absentees are one issue, but what we can't understand is why is it that mail-in ballots and early votes are still being counted and have not yet been properly recorded? According to our laws, those votes are supposed to be uploaded the day before election so that they can be reported half an hour after the votes close the next day.\u00a0\nSo we are at loss to understand what is happening in Palm Beach and Broward. And it is the same two counties that can't seem to get it right out of our 67 counties in the state of Florida.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Well, what about the concern -- I want to go back to you, Joseph, about Brenda Snipes in Broward and the concern that Marco Rubio -- he was on another network -- no, he was on our network, earlier tonight, and he just was basically laying waste to what happens in Broward County.\u00a0\nThe president tweeted out about this also tonight, which we will put up on the screen -- we put it up on the screen and then I will go back to you, Joseph. This is what the president said tonight. He said, \"Law enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with election fraud in Broward and Palm Beach, Florida. Florida voted for Rick Scott.\" Your comment tonight, Joseph.\u00a0\nKLOCK: Well, as Barry said, our legislature thought that they addressed some of the problems to avoid this kind of thing from happening. It is really kind of embarrassing to the state that we have to have this kind of thing go on. And as, you know, my county, my home county is Miami, Dade, we don't have this kind of thing happening here.\u00a0\nAnd if, you know, because Ms. Snipes apparently has this cloud hanging over her head, and then if there indeed ballots that are now showing up, they shouldn't be. I mean, the only ballots we should be waiting for at this point in time are the military ballots which I understand have until November 16th.\u00a0\nSo, I think, you know, we need to make sure that we take whatever steps are necessary with the judiciary to protect the integrity of the system so that we don't have these problems. And I think Barry will agree that one of the reasons we still have this is we don't have statewide controls over balloting. It is done on a county by county basis, and that is why you can have these outliers.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Got it. OK, so Barry, you know, I didn't practice election law, but I remember being down in Miami, Dade during the recount. I think I remember seeing you guys down there at the time, but this is what Rick Scott said, this was just a short while ago, referring to Marc Elias in Tallahassee. Let's watch.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nRICK SCOTT, R, FLORIDA SENATE CANDIDATE: I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida. Senator Nelson hired one of Hillary Clinton's lawyers from D.C., and the first thing he did was tell reporters he is here to win the election. Now, he is here to try to steal the election and to try to thwart the will of the voters of Florida.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Barry, your reaction -- tough words from Rick Scott tonight. He is certainly not going to sit back in what he believes is going to be an election stolen for him at the hands of Miss Snipes.\u00a0\nRICHARD: Well, I have no reaction in the first place. I am not involved in that race. And in the second place, it is not my purpose to become involved in the political debate, I am just the lawyer representing a client legally and those things are beyond my sphere of representation.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Oh, the old Brendan Sullivan thing, I'm not talking about it, I respect that. Good for you, Barry.\u00a0\nRICHARD: No, no, no, that is not what I do. I'm a lawyer, I'm representing a client.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I got it. I go it.\u00a0\nRICHARD: I represent Republicans and Democrats.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I didn't say otherwise. I appreciate it. Miguel, I want go to you on this because obviously, we want to protect the integrity of the vote. I agree with Stacey Abrams and everyone else who said every vote should count. If you voted and you're eligible to vote, your vote should count.\u00a0\nI think what -- people watch this, and they are like, how is this in the United States of America that this kind of stuff seems to drag on. People are talking about this dragging on another few weeks in Florida. And I think that's what kind of eats away at people, both Democrats, Republicans, people on the, you know, in the middle.\u00a0\nDE GRANDY: Laura, I can't agree more. I lost my first election to the Florida House of Representatives by one vote in 1998, so I am very keen on the fact that every vote needs to be counted and our election needs to be tabulated fairly.\u00a0\nWhat concerns us at this point is the irregularities that are occurring, when we can't view the ballots being, for example, the ballots that are damaged, being duplicated, which is required by law, in the presence of witnesses. And we are denied access to that process where we start hearing that in Palm Beach County, there are situations where they are actually taking steps that are outside of the public domain.\u00a0\nThat they are divining voter intent when that is the exclusive providence of the canvassing board, and putting those as recorded votes instead of bringing them to the canvassing board for their determination of public process. We should all be very concerned.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Yes. They have to be verified by the proper channels, not just a divine -- intention divine. And By the way, Gillum's campaign said -- put out a tweet, \"The Gillum campaign is looking for volunteers to help cure leftover ballots.\" What does that mean, Barry, since you will talk about your client? We're almost out of time. I get it guys. So cure leftover ballots, what does that mean, Barry?\u00a0\nRICHARD: To cure leftover ballots?\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Yes, that is what your campaign sent out, what does that mean?\u00a0\nRICHARD: I don't know what it means. I'm not suggesting --\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: You represent them but you don't know what that means. OK. All right.\u00a0\nRICHARD: I don't know what it means because I don't know what that reference was to. It is not something I am involved in. I'm not trying to be difficult for you, but when I was asked to come on the show, it was to address the differences between the 2000 campaign --\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: We got it. That is the point you made earlier.\u00a0\nRICHARD: -- we vote and this one and you are asking me questions that are beyond my core of knowledge.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I didn't know. I'm sorry, I didn't know you were so sensitive about so you can't talk about what the campaign --\u00a0\nRICHARD: I'm not sensitive but I'm not -- listen, I'm not a political spokesman. I'm a lawyer who represents clients. If you want to ask me about that, I'm happy to respond.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I understand. I understand. Well, this is your client, I imagine, talking about curing ballots.\u00a0\nRICHARD: Well, you asked me what -- you asked me what a statement meant when he said \"cure ballots,\" that is not a legal term. I didn't write the statement and I don't know what it means.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: OK, all right. This is not advancing the conversation. All right, we appreciate it. Gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us. And next, after already sending liberal opponents into a tizzy, we will tell you what Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker just dropped that has left even the most unhinged more unhinged. Stay there.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are we approaching a constitutional crisis?\u00a0\nSEN. JOE MANCHIN, D\u2014W. VA.: I think we're on the verge of that. I think it is a big mistake to let Jeff Sessions go. What raises my concerns is the person who has been so vocal against the investigation that was going on, now putting in charge a day after the election. I think that sheds bad light on it.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Now, Joe Manchin is obviously feeling pretty comfortable since his re-election, but his contention is shared though among the left and media chattering class, mainly that Jeff Sessions, his forced resignation as attorney general and Matt Whitaker's ascension to this acting role in the post, poses a grave constitutional threat to the country and imperils Mueller's investigation.\u00a0\nHere to separate fact from fiction, former DOJ prosecutor James Trusty and former U.S. assistant attorney David Katz. James, I want to start with you. There are some suggestions that even when conservative legal minds, Kellyanne Conway's husband, George, that this was an illegal appointment in the acting capacity of Mr. Whitaker.\u00a0\nJAMES TRUSTY, FORMER DOJ PROSECUTOR: Well, I mean, this is all new territory so we can't pretend that anybody has got like some vivid example to make their case. But there are scholars and there are may be more politically oriented scholars getting out there and saying that the fact that this is a non-Senate confirmed person renders him ineligible.\u00a0\nI think there is still a whole bunch of the corollary issues when it comes to the Mueller probe and Rod Rosenstein, but there are at least some people reporting that they think this violates the constitution. It's an invalid pick.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: David, this is what Conway and Neal Katyal write in today's \"New York Times.\" \"Mr. Trump's installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of Sessions is unconstitutional. It's illegal. And it mean that anything Mr. Whitaker does or tries to do in that position is invalid.\u00a0\nConstitutionally, Whitaker is a nobody. His job as Mr. Sessions' chief of staff didn't require Senate confirmation, as James just said. For the president to install Whitaker as our chief law enforcement officer is to betray the entire structure of our charter document.\" David?\u00a0\nDAVID KATZ, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, Laura, it is great to be on with you again. And the person that I would quote on this is Justice Thomas. Justice Thomas wrote a very incisive decision where he said that framers of the constitution recognized that there is great risk of corruption and abuse if one person could name all of the top officers in government.\u00a0\nIn this situation, that refers to President Trump. Of course, what Justice Thomas was referring to was that the framers had great experience with kings and other people, who at the time didn't have any check on their power. So, I am with Justice Thomas on this one. I'm worried about this issue. I think everyone should be worried about this issue of the president appointing a principal officer.\u00a0\nNow, he could appoint Whitaker and nominate him, and the Senate, which is Republican, including in the lame duck session, there are 51 Republican senators -- they just approved Kavanaugh -- let him appoint -- let him nominate this man, Whitaker, and let him have a Senate confirmation hearing if he thinks he is really the person for the job, but not in this manner. In this manner, Laura, he's got to put Rosenstein in there, or he's got to put the solicitor general in there.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: All right, so first of all, nice try on Justice Thomas, but you are making a massive leap from that case and a general statement about the government to a specific case involving a specific acting attorney general. We don't have time to debate that. That was cute, though.\u00a0\nJames, let's talk about what is really going on here. Adam Schiff also -- look, for them it is Mueller, Mueller, Mueller. You notice we did not talk about Mueller at all during the midterms, but now the midterms are over, so it's back to Russia, Russia, Russia. And so this is what they are worried about. They are worried about Whitaker who said things on CNN before that seemed to be more hostile toward the idea of Mueller. So this is what Adam Schiff said today, let's watch.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF, D\u2014CALIF.: If he doesn't recuse himself, that any decision he makes in the Mueller investigation is going to have a taint about it. Did he, was he forced somehow to make a commitment to the president to ignore the advice of (inaudible) at the Justice Department, or not to seek out their advice?\u00a0\nWas that part of his getting the job? Because this president is guided by one thing alone, and that is what is good for Donald Trump, the country doesn't matter that much.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Again, ignore the pejorative -- that is just typical Adam Schiff, but he is making the Conway point about, OK, anything he does is thus invalid. Today they announced the new rules or what they want to be the new rules on the migrants coming in, specifically a change to asylum law.\u00a0\nNow, Jeff Sessions was all on board on all of this, by the way, but that you would have to present yourself at a port of entry, not just, you know, coming across the border and then saying I want asylum. Is that what they are setting up here so anything Whitaker is a part of, no, no, no. No can do? And does that survive legal challenge?\u00a0\nTRUSTY: Well, I mean, again, unchartered territory. But they are certainly setting up a situation where they are inviting litigation at every step of the way. And for the Mueller probe I would just say-, really the key is still Rosenstein.\u00a0\nRosenstein is a Senate confirmed superior officer. If he has any voice on the supervision then there is really no issue there in terms of the appointments clause. But if they clean house, if Rosenstein leaves, then you really have a pretty viable issue about whether Mueller loses inferior officer status and becomes somebody subject to all sorts of motions to dismiss or motions to quash subpoenas.\u00a0\nSo, it is inviting a litigation, but nobody can act like this is essentially, you know, the capital is on fire and that we're about to lose our democracy.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Yes, the whole democracy.\u00a0\nHey David, real quick, a friend of mine mentioned to me today, it would have been a kind of a NATO move by Trump to name Rod Rosenstein as acting attorney general. He's already overseeing the Mueller investigation, big deal. They seem to be talking about getting along. Could have done that, right?\u00a0\nKATZ: Laura, he'd be the logical choice. There is no question he was presidentially nominated and he was approved by the Senate. Likewise, the solicitor general seems like a good candidate and would be a proper person.\u00a0\nBut I think -- I think that they should litigate this issue, and I think that they will. And I do think that Justice Thomas would be with the people who would say, in accordance with the National Labor Relations Board case, which is a recent decision, that President Trump cannot do this. And I think that he should pull back and maybe put Rosenstein in there. He would be a good choice. Why not if they are getting along?\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: All right, thanks, guys, appreciate it.\u00a0\nAnd up next, breaking new developments in the mass shooting in California. And inside a bar filled with college students for country night, a dozen dead, including a sheriff's deputy. Tonight he's being called a hero. And one of his former friends and former coworkers joins me next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our friends got the barstools and they started slamming them against the windows so we could get out. So we were able to get out come out, he broke the window.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Tonight, police are still trying to determine the motive of that gunman that opened fired inside a California bar, killing a dozen people, including a sheriff's deputy. The terrifying ordeal caught on camera. Sergeant Ron Helus was one of the first officers to enter the Borderline Bar and Grill and was killed trying to stop the shooter. He is being hailed as a hero for saving lives last night.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nGEOFF DEAN, VENTURA COUNTY, CA, SHERIFF: Sergeant Helus was on the force for 29 years, was looking to retire in the next year or so. He died a hero because he went in to save lives, to save other people.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Joining me now is a man who knows Sergeant Helus well, Deputy Chad Anderson of the Ventura County Sheriffs Department who worked with Officer Helus. The sheriff's department is grieving tonight, and we are so -- I feel like we do this way too often, but we are so sorry for your loss. What an amazing man, and you are such a good friend of Officer Helus. Tell us about him as a person tonight.\u00a0\nDEPUTY CHAD ANDERSON, VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT: Well, he was a great man. I worked with him when I first graduated the police academy, and he was a great sergeant, he was always there for us, they are to lead us and to guide us. And he was a great man.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: How is his family doing tonight? I know the heartache will never go away, really. But any word on his family?\u00a0\nANDERSON: No. They are still dealing with it. It's as tough as you can imagine it is.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Tell us what you know about what happened in this bar. A former marine combat officer, or enlistee, I guess, goes in there, really fun college night, great hangout for some of the Pepperdine students and others, and just turned into a bloodbath. What do we know?\u00a0\nANDERSON: Yes. We know that, so we received phone calls, the 911 dispatch center received phone calls at about 11:19 last night. Sergeant Helus responded. When he got to the Borderline, there were two CHP officers rendering aid to one of the victims. And as they were rendering aid, they heard Sergeant Helus -- heard shots fires. So he grabbed one of the CHP officers, and they entered the borderline. And when they entered, Sergeant Helus was struck multiple times. The CHP officer grabbed a Sergeant Helus and pulled him out to a safer location. And later he was transported to the Los Robles Medical Center, and there he succumbed to his injuries.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Another act of senseless --\u00a0\nANDERSON: A really tough time for all of us here.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Senseless violence. A man reportedly dealing with some obviously PTSD, mental issues, had some fairly minor brushes with the law. But anything else on your radar about the gunman, who killed himself, tonight, anything more that we know?\u00a0\nANDERSON: We responded in April of this year. That was the only other contact we had with this suspect. We responded to his house for a family disturbance, and the deputies contacted the crisis intervention team. They responded, evaluated the suspect, and didn't deem that he was a danger to himself or others, and he was released from the scene. And that's the only other contact we had with him.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Do you know if he had gun permits, he was clearing a Glock 45, I guess. Did he have a permit for that?\u00a0\nANDERSON: I'm not aware if he had a permanent or not.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: OK, deputy, thank you so much.\u00a0\nANDERSON: The investigation --\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: The investigation is ongoing, I know, we will learn a lot more in the future.\u00a0\nANDERSON: The investigation is still going, yes.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Deputy, thank you so much. We grieve with all of you, and we will continue to pray for you, your whole community, all of the survivors, the victims, our hearts break for you. Thank you so much for being here.\u00a0\nANDERSON: OK, thank you.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: And Mark Fuhrman, former L.A. homicide detective, FOX News contributor. Mark, another soft target tragically exploited last night, gun fire, 12 dead. What is the first step to, maybe, can we better protect places like this going forward, or this is just what we are going to have to deal with?\u00a0\nMARK FUHRMAN, RETIRED LAPD DETECTIVE: Laura, unfortunately a soft target where the suspect is actually one of the regular customers makes it almost impossible. He is known to security. Security is not armed. Security was taken out immediately by the suspect, and then he went inside and took out more security so he could actually do what he wanted inside the bar. It's pretty tough to create a hard target out of a restaurant or a bar where people can walk in and out, even with security.\u00a0\nI kind of wonder his motive. This is where a lot of survivors from the Las Vegas shooting actually congregated and actually were celebrating life, and I'm sure it was well known who they wear. They there that night of the shooting. And I kind of wonder if this was not possibly something to do with the motive for the suspect.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Yes, and this being reported on now, just we are learning the beginning information about some of the victims, one who in particular who survived, obviously Las Vegas, succumbed to injuries last night. Mark, when I hear about the sergeant, he was the first one to go in with another police officer, and he went in there, because that is what you do when you hear gunshots, went in immediately, and was almost immediately, apparently, hit multiple times. When he go into a situation like that, you hear gunfire, you walk in -- just tell us what you are trained to do and why you are trained to do it.\u00a0\nFUHRMAN: Certainly you don't want to walk in to -- directly into fire. You want to somewhat flank any entry, if you can. But we can just only imagine, a bar usually has a rear exit through the kitchen or the back of the restaurant or the back of the bar, and they have a front entrance. That is where the direction of the fire was coming from.\u00a0\nAnd unfortunately, because of all of the school shootings, the only tactic that you can actually use if you are a first responder is you have to go to the shooting to try to stop the mass murder. If you just wait and set up a perimeter and wait for SWAT, the suspect is just continually killing people. And this is where the tactic comes up.\u00a0\nSo the sergeant and the CHP officer had to go to the only location where they could gain entry, and I'm sure they tactically tried to enter. But once they did, he was fatally shot. That creates a tactical nightmare when you have only one way in and you have to go in. When you talk about bravery, knowing that you are going in to a hot scene with an active shooter, and there's only one place that you can go in and only one place the suspect has to focus on, that concentrates of the fire in one location where you are going in.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: You just walk right into it, which it sounds like he did. What an incredible man and a horrific story. Mark Fuhrman, you always give us such great perspective. Thank you so much tonight.\u00a0\nAnd President Trump called them out by name yesterday, and tonight, the establishment is fighting back. Sean Spicer, Cory Lewandowski are here with a message for a few of the sore losers. Don't go away.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: Carlos Curbelo, Mike Coffman -- too bad, Mike. Mia Love, Mia Love gave me no love.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I'm sorry. That was from President Trump. It didn't sit well with him and they didn't really support him. And it didn't sit well with a few of the outgoing House members. Here is Pennsylvania congressman Ryan Costello.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nREP. RYAN COSTELLO, R\u2014PENN.: Those folks gave their all in a very tough political environment that was created because of the president. Not only did he not acknowledge that, but he somehow falsely suggested that if they would have attached themselves closer to him, that they would have done better when I would make the argument they would have done worse.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: What a shame that he is retiring from Pennsylvania sixth with that personality. So what did two of the president's former staffers think of all of this? Let's ask them. Joining me now, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, former Trump campaign manager, co-author of \"Trump's Enemies,\" Corey Lewandowski. Corey, I watched this Ryan Costello on CNN today, and I just started howling. The guy jumped out of the sandbox because it was too difficult to play, he retired after two whopping terms, and then he's like, oh, the president is being mean, and he is the one who dragged the whole party down. If it wasn't for President Trump, we would be dealing with Hillary in the midterms.\u00a0\nCOREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: You are exactly right, and people have a very short memory because Donald Trump carried so many across the finish line just two years ago. I can think of at least four members of the U.S. Senate and dozens of members of Congress who wouldn't have been reelected if Donald Trump wasn't on the ticket.\u00a0\nAnd look at the races where the candidates embraced Donald Trump in Missouri, in North Dakota, in South Dakota, in both of the major races in Florida, in so many other places, in Kentucky sixth district with Andy Barr. When they brought Donald Trump in, when they said come in and help us, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, come and help us, we want to run with you, those people are coming back to Washington because they embraced the Trump-Pence agenda. And those that didn't, they are going home.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Sean, there are some tougher districts. Curbelo's district, south Florida, he said -- this is a tweet he sent out. He said, \"So yesterday, Donald Trump stated that had I been more aligned with him, I may have one back. Let's check, I lost Florida 26th, 49-51. My colleague, DeSantis, who is closely aligned with the president, lost 46-53.\" I don't know what he is talking about, lost 46-53. But I guess he is saying it is a small difference. It is not a big difference. So the idea that Trump somehow -- his distance from Trump and some issues caused the loss, I mean, he is representing a fairly purplish district.\u00a0\nSEAN SPICER: That is right. But I think this election, in particular, was a base election. This was about energizing either our side or the Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer side. The president very clearly demonstrated through his travel through those battleground states, especially in those final few days, that he was going to run through the tape, energize the base. The Kavanaugh stuff really got people going, his talk about what was at stake and the results that he was getting.\u00a0\nWhen you coming into an election like this, getting that base fired up, getting the enthusiasm gap closed, it was a month-and-a-half ago that the Democrats enjoyed up to a 12-point enthusiasm gap. It was because of the president and him hitting the campaign trail that that gap closed.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Corey, Romney tweeted out something kind of interesting after the midterms. He said the following, \"I want to thank Jeff Sessions for his service to our country as attorney general. Under Acting Attorney General Whitaker, it is imperative that the important work of the DOJ continues and the Mueller investigation proceeds to its conclusion unimpeded.\" What did you make of that?\u00a0\nLEWANDOWSKI: This is Mitt Romney already injecting himself into the Washington scene. I think he is going to be ultimately a thorn in the side of the president for a long time. Mitt is the one who made the speech that the president, then candidate Trump wasn't qualified. He changed his tune when running for the U.S. Senate, and now he is coming to Washington, D.C., I heard he was shopping for an apartment today in Washington.\u00a0\nAnd look, this president has been very clear, Bob Mueller is going to finish of the investigation, but you can't have an investigation that goes on in perpetuity. Bring this to close, let the American people see exactly what I already know, there was no collusion, there was no cooperation, there was no coordination with the Russians in any way, shape, or form by our campaign, and let's end this investigation so we can get on with the people's business.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Sean, I know it --\u00a0\nSPICER: Laura, real quick, I think one of the things that is forgotten is that the president, the underlying premise of why the president fired Sessions was because of the Sessions misled him, frankly. Sessions took a job know that he would have to recuse himself, and the president felt like he was offering him something and that he was going to be the faithful steward and leader of a department. And shortly after taking the job, recused himself, thereby not able to be the true, full leader that was supposed to be the person he was appointing as attorney general.\u00a0\nSo everyone is jumping to conclusions about what this means for Mueller, but the bottom line is we have seen from the president's words, actions, and tweets for the past year-and-a-half that frankly this stemmed from a level of disappointment in how Jeff Sessions presented himself for the job in the first place.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: The Sessions people are telling me in the last couple of days that Sessions didn't know that the campaign was being investigated until after, of course, that reassurance to the president, until he gets in DOJ. So he could have said he wasn't going to recuse, but on the investigation, on the campaign, once that was going to be the subject of part of the investigation -- again, that is what I am being told, and it kind of makes sense to me.\u00a0\nBut nevertheless, Mitt Romney, God bless you, are you setting up a 2020 challenge to President Trump, that's my question tonight. Gentlemen, great to see you, as always.\u00a0\nAnd coming up, racial politics have been an issue that has been animating the left the entire cycle. They're not done yet. Wait until you hear what Bernie Sanders said about white voters in Florida and Georgia. That debate next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Here's what Bernie Sanders thinks about Florida and Georgia voters, quote, \"There are a lot of white folks out there who are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an African-American.\" Joining us now with reaction, Democratic strategist and civil rights attorney Will Jawando, and Project 21 cochair Horace Cooper. Horace, your reaction to Sanders tonight.\u00a0\nHORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: If everything is racism, nothing is racism. People who voted for Barack Obama now want to vote for Donald Trump. People who voted Republican, they voted Democrat, that is how people make choices. Calling them out as bigots or somehow uncomfortable with blacks doesn't serve any interests. In fact, it sets us all back.\nINGRAHAM: Will, is there something to that, that everything does seem to be hit with the r-word now, if it involves either a challenger who is a minority or an incumbent who is a minority, at some point race will be involved.\u00a0\nWILL JAWANDO, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: These are southern states. There's only been two black elected governors ever in the history of the country. Slavery, racism is our original sin here. We're still dealing with the after effects. There is a region that DOJ had preclearance in these states until the voting rights act was eviscerated.\u00a0\nSo of course some people show up -- I've run for office. I've had people call me the n-word at their door, I've had people invite me in that didn't look like me. So it exists in our country, but I think it's getting better. I think the real story is you see Abrams and Gillum and others, Lauren Underwood in a 94 percent district get elected. So things are changing, it exists, but it's the dichotomy in America. But I think it's true, though.\u00a0\nCOOPER: Bernie Sanders should recognize, if you come up with an extremist progressive agenda, it doesn't matter what your color is. People are going to reject you.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: They did some liberal stuff on the referenda, didn't they? They did the Medicaid expansion, marijuana, more marijuana stuff.\u00a0\nCOOPER: They certainly did. But O'Rourke lost in Texas for the same kind of reason. You can't be an extremist and win. That's the real issue here. Don't call it racism. Let's have a real conversation.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: A debate. The problem is when you call someone racist that kind of ends the conversation. There's really nowhere to go there because you don't even deserve a debate if you're a racist.\u00a0\nJAWANDO: I don't think he said they were racist.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: He came pretty close.\u00a0\nJAWANDO: But I think the point is you have to acknowledge racism exists.\u00a0\nCOOPER: Racism is not explaining the elections that are happening in the United States of America. We just watched.\u00a0\nJAWANDO: It's a factor.\u00a0\nCOOPER: It is not a factor. It is not a factor. That is ridiculous.\u00a0\nJAWANDO: To say it's not a factor is --\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: You guys, when we do a whole show, we're going to do a whole show on this topic, and you guys have to be on. We want you and three other people for the hour. And we are probably going to take it out of Washington, frankly. But thank you so much for joining us, and sorry it's short tonight.\u00a0\nRight back with some news that just broke, stay right there.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: The Florida recounts are going to be big news for the foreseeable future. We told you early about President Trump's reaction. This was a tweet that came out a couple of hours ago, law enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with election fraud in Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott.\u00a0\nChuck Schumer has now responded, and he put out a tweet. And in the tweet he said, he said -- law enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal. So there is on the screen. \"In a democracy, no one, not even the president, can prevent the lawful counting of votes. We'll not allow him or anyone else to steal this election.\" My friends, this is going to be a big one. Sorry I was reading the wrong tweet. So Schumer, Trump going after each other.\u00a0\nOne more point, we're almost out of time. One more point. OK. Tonight, a Montana federal district court judge, Brian Morris, an Obama appointee, put a temporary, well, hold on the Keystone Pipeline saying the justification for it was incomplete. I didn't have to ask who the judge was but I knew it was an Obama appointee. And I was right.\u00a0\nSo, Brian Morris, look for the Justice Department to appeal that. That's going to go all the way to the Ninth Circuit. Got to have more judges on the Ninth Circuit.\u00a0\nAll right. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team will never read the wrong tweet.\u00a0Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "A female student was reportedly criticized by a teacher for wearing a \u201ctank top and shorts\u201d to summer school. (iStock) One Wisconsin school district may have relaxed its dress code for the 2018-2019 year after complaints from the school community, but the ACLU says that the administration is enforcing the new regulations in a \u201csexist\u201d way. On Sept. 11, WUWM reported that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin was putting the squeeze on Kenosha Unified School District school board officials over an incident that reportedly occurred in June during summer school. According to the outlet, a female student was criticized by a teacher for wearing a \u201ctank top and shorts\u201d to gym class. NEW JERSEY CHARTER SCHOOL SLAMMED FOR TURNING AWAY STUDENTS FOR MINOR DRESS CODE VIOLATIONS For context, the Kenosha Unified School District school board added tank tops, yoga pants and leggings to its list of permitted sartorial items after backlash from students and parents last year that such stipulations were discriminatory against female students, BBC reports. The school district encompasses 24 elementary schools, five middle schools, three high schools and five choice schools, six charter schools and one specialty school, as per their website. Though the new dress code featured on TMJ4 News mandates that bottoms must be \u201cmid-thigh length and cover all private body parts at all times\u201d and allows tank tops with \u201cstraps [that] are at least one inch in width,\u201d the trouble apparently was not yet over. \u201cA female student had been shamed in front of her classmates and threatened to be sent home two days in a row for wearing a tank top and shorts to a summer gym class,\u201d ACLU Wisconsin staff attorney Asma Kadri Keeler recounted to WUWM. Upon further investigation, Kadri Keeler reported she found the policies regarding dress code enforcement for Kenosha staffers to be lacking. \u201cOur position is that this is primarily a sexist gender issue,\u201d Kadri Keller further told Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThese incidents that are cropping up all around the country that various ACLU affiliates and ACLU national are involved in revolve around girls and young women.\u201d Moving forward, the ACLU has issued a statement urging the Kenosha school district to clarify the enforcement measures for their new dress code policies and protect students from body shaming and harassment if they face a violation. Representatives for the ACLU of Wisconsin and Kenosha Unified School District did not immediately return Fox News\u2019 request for additional comment on the story.

            "article_content": "Political price for Democrats? The Obama administration took aim at the coal industry on Monday by mandating a 30 percent cut in carbon emissions at fossil fuel-burning power plants by 2030 -- despite claims the regulation will cost nearly a quarter-million jobs a year and force plants across the country to close. The controversial regulation, which some lawmakers already are trying to block, is one of the most sweeping efforts to tackle global warming by this or any other administration. The 645-page plan, expected to be finalized next year, is a centerpiece of President Obama's climate change agenda, and a step that the administration hopes will get other countries to act when negotiations on a new international treaty resume next year. \"We have a moral obligation to act,\" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said, in announcing the plan Monday morning. While the proposed regulation drew praise from environmental groups, the coal industry and coal-state lawmakers were immediately wary. Democratic West Virginia Rep. Nick Rahall announced he would introduce legislation, along with Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., to stop the EPA plan. \"We will introduce bipartisan legislation that will prevent these disastrous new rules from wreaking havoc on our economy in West Virginia,\" Rahall said in a statement. Bill Bissett, president of the Kentucky Coal Association, said he's \"certain that it will be very bad news for states like Kentucky who mine and use coal to create electricity.\" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who represents Kentucky, called it a \"dagger in the heart of the American middle class\" -- and predicted higher power costs and less reliable energy as a result.\u00a0McConnell's general election opponent, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, also spoke out against the plan. The draft regulation sidesteps Congress, where Obama's Democratic allies have failed to pass a so-called \"cap-and-trade\" plan to limit such emissions. Under the plan, carbon emissions would be reduced 30 percent by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. The proposal sets off a complex regulatory process in which the 50 states will each determine how to meet customized targets set by the EPA. States could have until 2017 to submit a plan to cut power plant pollution, and 2018 if they join with other states to tackle the problem, according to the EPA's proposal. EPA data shows that the nation's power plants have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 13 percent since 2005. But with coal-fired power plants already beleaguered by cheap natural gas prices and other environmental regulations, experts said reaching the targets won't be easy. The EPA is expected to offer a range of options to states to meet targets that will be based on where they get their electricity and how much carbon dioxide they emit in the process. While some states will be allowed to emit more and others less, overall the reduction will be 30 percent nationwide. The options include making power plants more efficient, reducing the frequency at which coal-fired power plants supply power to the grid, and investing in more renewable, low-carbon sources of energy. They also can set up pollution-trading markets as some states already have done to offer more flexibility in how plants cut emissions. If a state refuses to create a plan, the EPA can make its own. The Obama administration claimed the changes would produce jobs, cut electricity bills and save thousands of lives thanks to cleaner air. But critics disputed the estimates. \"Throughout his presidency, Barack Obama has adopted a 'my way or the highway' approach, and that explains why he's shoving these EPA regulations down our throat,\" Republican Party Chairman \u00a0Reince Priebus said in a statement. \"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has found that each year this regulation will kill 224,000 jobs and force energy rates to skyrocket, so it's no wonder President Obama is circumventing Congress to implement his latest job-killing regulation.\" Hundreds of coal-burning plants will have to comply, which has resulted in strong opposition from the energy industry, big business and coal-state Democrats and Republicans, who argue Obama\u2019s green-energy agenda is tantamount to a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d The U.S. Chamber of Commerce argues that the rule will kill jobs and close power plants across the country. The group released a study\u00a0that finds the rule will result in the loss of 224,000 jobs every year through 2030 and impose $50 billion in annual costs. Without waiting to see what Obama proposes, governors in Kansas, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia have already signed laws directing their environmental agencies to develop their own carbon-emission plans. Similar measures recently passed in Missouri and are pending in the Louisiana and Ohio legislatures. On Saturday, Obama tried to bolster public support for the new rule by arguing that carbon-dioxide emissions are a national health crisis -- beyond hurting the economy and causing global warming. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to choose between the health of our economy and the health of our children,\u201d Obama said in his weekly address. \u201cAs president and as a parent, I refuse to condemn our children to a planet that\u2019s beyond fixing.\u201d Many anticipate the rule change will increase electricity prices, considering the United States relies on coal for 40 percent of its electricity. However, the plants also are the country\u2019s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Many of the Democrats who are raising concerns represent coal-producing states and face tough 2014 reelection bids. Among them is West Virginia Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall, whose state gets 96 percent of its power from coal. Rahall said Thursday that he didn't have specific details about the rule, but \"from everything we know we can be sure of this: It will be bad for jobs.\" Obama is being forced to use the 1970s-era old Clean Air Act, after failing during his first term to get Congress to pass a law. The law has long been used to regulate pollutants like soot, mercury and lead, but has only recently been applied to greenhouse gases. \"There are no national limits to the amount of carbon pollution that existing plants can pump into the air we breathe. None,\" Obama said Saturday in his weekly radio and Internet address. \"We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury, sulfur, and arsenic that power plants put in our air and water. But they can dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the air. It's not smart, it's not safe, and it doesn't make sense.\" The rule also will prescribe technological fixes or equipment to be placed on existing plants and require new ones to capture some of their carbon dioxide and bury it underground.
