            "article_content": "If the Trump administration and Congress tackle welfare reform this year \u2014 perhaps a big \"if\" in an election year \u2014 they'll still likely leave the largest drivers of the national debt untouched, making little difference in the country's fiscal future, policy experts tell CBS News. President Trump has declared welfare reform a \"very big topic under this administration,\" and a potential agenda item for 2018. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is also interested.  \"We are looking at it,\" Mr. Trump said during Camp David meetings on Saturday, surrounded by leaders in Congress and his administration. \"It's a subject that's very dear to our heart. We'll try and do something in a bipartisan way.\" But it's Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 more than the more than 80 smaller welfare programs \u2014 that are driving up the country's debt, say experts at the kind of right-of-center think tanks whose proposals the Trump administration and Congress might be most willing to consider. Together, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid make up nearly half of all government spending, the total of which was roughly $4 trillion in 2017, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Those smaller programs account for about $366 billion or 9 percent of the total federal budget in 2016, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities \u2014 not an insignificant sum, but not enough to right the country's fiscal woes, noted Robert Doar, a fellow in poverty studies at the American Enterprise Institute who served as the commissioner of the New York City Human Resources Administration under Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\u00a0 \"If you're trying to save money, there really isn't that much money in 'poor people's programs' to save, with one huge exception, and that's Medicaid,\" Doar said.\u00a0 \"If it's spending and debt the Trump administration and Congress are primarily concerned about, they should look first at entitlements,\" said Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center in Virginia.  \"They should, in an ideal world, be going after Social Security and Medicare,\" she said.  But that seems unlikely. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump declared he would not touch Social Security, insisting that the country needed to honor a deal made long ago and eliminating waste and fraud in the system might help secure its future. But the problem with Social Security is a \"structural one,\" de Rugy said, with fewer than three workers paying for every retiree, a massive shift from the 45 workers per retiree when the program began. That could shrink to two workers per retiree by 2030. \"Republicans usually have kind of cold feet when it comes to Social Security and Medicare,\" de Rugy said. Their feet grow even colder when lawmakers are defending their seats. \"In an election year, there's no chance of talks of reforming Social Security and Medicare,\" she added.  Part of the problem in addressing welfare reform is how it's defined \u2014 not everyone agrees on what \"welfare\" is, and not everyone agrees on what \"reform\" means.  \"In order to analyze and reform welfare, we have to define what welfare is,\" said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow who focuses on poverty issues at the Heritage Foundation. Welfare is different from entitlements, which encompass mandatory spending programs like Social Security and Medicare, programs largely dependent on age. Welfare programs are generally means-tested programs, meaning they depend on a person's income. Whether Medicaid qualifies as welfare depends on who you ask.\u00a0 Medicaid has long contributed to increased spending, even before it was expanded under the Affordable Care Act. But all last year, during the various Obamacare repeal attempts, the Republican-led Congress was unable to scale back the program, and the possibility of changes in an election year seem even less likely. Still, if Republicans are serious about improving welfare programs in a way that aids the neediest and helps lift people out of poverty, there is plenty of room for improvement, said Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. He said he's seen enthusiasm grow in the GOP in recent years for improving the actual programs. \"A key distinction that I think has some potential, and there is a lot of interest in the Republican Party, is, between cutting welfare and making it work more effectively,\" Cass said.  A couple major areas in need of reform stick out to de Rugy. The Trump administration and Congress need to consolidate duplicate or similar programs, de Rugy advises, placing them all under the same tent.  \"There are several housing programs, there are several food programs, there are all sorts of programs, and there are many duplicates of all of them,\" de Rugy said.  Turning more programs into a block-grant structure, giving states a set amount of money such as is the case in the cash assistance program Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is another major change Congress should undertake, she said. That way, states can decide how to most effectively use a limited resource.\u00a0 Rector said Congress also needs to address how the current welfare system discourages marriage by eliminating benefits when a recipient increases his or her income through marriage, calling that penalty a \"disastrous\" situation. The real marriage penalty isn't in the tax system, but in the safety net, he added. Marriage is one of the best societal mechanisms for keeping children out of poverty, so penalizing marriage is counterproductive, Rector noted.\u00a0 \"It's the single largest problem in the welfare system,\" Rector said.  Doar said the most helpful policy shift for families would be for Congress to encourage those who can work to work, through work training programs, and not penalizing people by eliminating their benefits entirely once they find work. While some programs do require recipients to work, in others, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps), and Medicaid, \"There isn't a sense that people who could work or who might want to work are being encouraged enough or sometimes pushed enough to take advantage of employment opportunities that are available in their communities,\" Doar said.  Work requirements could be something along the lines of a minimum of 10 hours per week, requiring enrollment in a training program, in exchange for food or other assistance, Doar said. If someone consistently fails to show up, those benefits would be eliminated.  \"There are ways to structure a work requirement that is not 'get a job or get out of here,' and Democrats have to acknowledge that because they've administered those kinds of programs, and Republicans have to be able to accept something less than full-time work or no assistance,\" Doar said.  To critics of such requirements, fearing they could hurt children dependent on those adults, Doar pointed to the TANF work requirements imposed by the Clinton-era welfare reforms of the 1990s.\u00a0 \"They weren't sloth work requirements, they were hard work requirements,\" Doar said. \"... Child poverty didn't get worse.\" In fact, child poverty continued to decline after those reforms, according to Census Bureau data.\u00a0 Cass had another suggestion for providing for low-income families while encouraging work at the same time \u2014 transforming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) into a more generous, paycheck-by-paycheck wage subsidy.  \"Frankly, I love the theory of the earned income tax credit,\" Cass said. \"I think it's right that part of the problem is it was never designed to be a way to get significant amounts of money to a very significant amount of the workforce.\" Much of the debate in Republican circles is between spending less on safety net programs, or simply spending money more effectively on safety net programs, Cass said. He hopes there can be some bipartisan interest in shifting some funding away from say, Medicaid, to something \"a little more flexible\" in the form of a wage subsidy for low-income families.  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, suggested something similar with the EMPLEO Act in 2016, a proposal Cass helped craft that would allow the federal government to subsidize the minimum wage so employers would, in theory, hire more workers at a lower cost to themselves. \u00a0\u00a0 \"A genuine wage subsidy just looks at how much you're earning each hour and puts your money into the paycheck at the end of the week,\" Cass said. But if more people are being pushed to work, the Trump administration and Congress need to recognize the government needs to do more in the way of childcare, Doar said. \"The one part of the safety net program that is weakest is child care,\" Doar said. \"They didn't really do anything on that matter in the tax bill, and everyone seems to acknowledge that if you're pushing more to work, we could have more and better-affordable child care options for low-income working families,\" Doar suggested. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0............................................... The Trump administration and Congress can start reforming the social safety net, but without a serious look at Medicaid, Social Security and Medicare, it's virtually pointless from a fiscal standpoint, Doar said.  The idea that the federal government \"can save real money in the rest of the welfare program, that's a lie. That's just not true,\" Doar added. \"It's not big enough to have any real significant impact on our budget problems.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Facebook co-founder and basic-income evangelist Chris Hughes says Facebook has an increasing responsibility to grapple with the influence it wields over relationships, society and even politics. He spoke Wednesday to CBSN's Elaine Quijano on \"Red & Blue\" about increasing abuse of the platform.\u00a0 \"People often ask me \u2026 could you have imagined that Facebook could be used for good or for ill?\" he said. \"In the early days it was a very hard thing to imagine, but in the last few years, as Facebook has gotten more and more prominent, there's more and more of a responsibility that comes with that.\" Hughes said he believed the people who are running the company \"seem to be turning a corner understanding\" how the platform can be abused. He said he hoped they would be making some changes. Hughes said that in the earliest days, there was a sense at Facebook of trying to keep up with the progress that was happening \"almost organically.\" But, after a few years, Hughes noted, Facebook has become more of the culture and a place where the conversation was taking place.\u00a0 \u00a0 Hughes noted that Facebook isn't \"just a place to go for fun\" but also has become the \"public square for 2018\" where debates are happening. \"It's taken some time for users to understand that, it's taken some time for the leadership of the company to understand that and I think we are entering a new moment where the response is more in line with the status of Facebook as a company,\" Hughes said. Facebook, in addition to Twitter and smaller social-media networks, has come under increasing scrutiny for its role in influencing the 2016 election -- an idea that Mark Zuckerberg, the company's CEO, initially brushed off. The company is now making amends, including\u00a0sending postcards\u00a0to people who may have seen Russian-backed advertising and increasing the number of staffers working on\u00a0security. The platform has also been criticized for the more subtle ways in which it restricts opportunity. Facebook's targeted ads can be used to, for example, exclude people of a particular ethnic affinity from\u00a0seeing housing ads, which is illegal under federal law.\u00a0 Facebook executive Rob Goldman tweeted last week \"I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say definitively that swaying the election was not the main goal,\" which President Trump retweeted and cited it as vindication. Hughes said he \"puts my stock\" in Mueller's indictment, which had a very clear case in enabling Russian actors to \u00a0interfere      in the election.\u00a0 \"I think it's clear Facebook was used in the 2016 election for malicious purposes,\" Hughes said.\u00a0 Hughes also said some of these Russian actors were \"quite literally trying to hack the ballot box\" in dozens of states, and as much as Facebook has certain responsiblities, the federal government does as well for elections.\u00a0 Hughes is promoting his new book, \"Fair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn,\" which came out Tuesday. As a freshman at Harvard, Hughes roomed with Mark Zuckerberg and went on to co-found Facebook, now one of the world's most valuable companies.\u00a0 Hughes, who was part of President Obama's 2008 team, is proposing a plan for \"guaranteed income for working people.\"\u00a0 \"The idea is that every working person in the United States should have basic financial stability,\" Hughes said. \"It's so obvious that if you work, you shouldn't live in poverty.\" In his book, Hughes is proposing a guaranteed of $500 for every American who makes less than $50,000 a month. Hughes says he makes it clear that he is \"park of the 1 percent\" and made nearly $500 million for three years, and he says now that he realizes that this is not that uncommon. If tax rates go back into line with historical averages for income above, Hughes says this will pay for the plan.\u00a0 Hughes said the leaders of \"big tech\" have a \"responsibility to speak out\" about income inequality. He said the recent tax cut \"makes no sense.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "\u00a0Oregon approved taxes on hospitals, health insurers and managed care companies in an unusual special election Tuesday that asked voters \u2014 and not lawmakers \u2014 how to pay for Medicaid costs that now include coverage of hundreds of thousands of low-income residents added to the program's rolls under the Affordable Care Act. Measure 101 was passing handily in early returns Tuesday night. The single-issue election drew national attention to this progressive state, which aggressively expanded its Medicaid rolls under President Barack Obama's health care reforms. Oregon now has one of the lowest rates of uninsured residents in the nation at 5 percent. About 1 million Oregonians \u2014 25 percent \u2014 now receive health care coverage from Medicaid. Maine voters recently went to polls to approve the expansion of their Medicaid program, but experts said Oregon was the first state to take the issue of funding that expansion directly to voters. The taxes are a short-term fix for health care funding that will generate between $210 million and $320 million in revenue over two years. \"Tonight's vote is an affirmation of our belief that Oregon is better off with a robust Medicaid program for our most vulnerable citizens,\" Andy Davidson, president and CEO of the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, said in a statement. \"We are proud to have been a partner in fighting for these patients and their families.\" The measure creates a 0.7 percent tax on some hospitals and a 1.5 percent tax on the gross health insurance premiums and on managed care organizations. The nonpartisan voter pamphlet said if the measure failed, the state might lose an additional $630 million to $960 million in federal Medicaid matching funds that flow to the poorest in the state. That possibility was enough to galvanize health care providers, doctors and nurses associations and insurers behind Measure 101. Hospitals said the costs of treating uninsured patients in emergency rooms would be more than the taxes imposed. Proponents also argued that more than 350,000 Oregonians who secured health care coverage under the expansion would lose it if Measure 101 failed. The ballot measure arose from a grassroots campaign to put parts of a bipartisan legislative funding solution passed last year before voters. Republican Rep. Julie Parrish and several colleagues were angered by portions of the bill that exempt unions and large, self-insured corporations like Nike from Medicaid taxes but not Oregonians who buy insurance on health care exchanges. They also believed hospitals and insurers will pass the cost to consumers, despite language that limits premium rate increases to 1.5 percent. Medicaid is a federal-state collaboration originally meant for poor families and severely disabled people. Over the years, it's grown to become the largest government health insurance program, now covering 1 in 5 Americans. In 2014, Oregon was one of 32 states and the District of Columbia to allow people making 138 percent of the federal poverty line to qualify for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That's $34,600 for a family of four. Before, they had to make less to qualify. The changes brought a slew of new enrollees, not just in Oregon but in all states that allowed an expansion of the program. For the first two years, the federal government covered the full cost for those new enrollees. In 2017, the match dropped to 95 percent, adding $136 million in costs in Oregon. It will drop to 90 percent in 2020. At the same time, the federal government asked Oregon to pay more for its other Medicaid recipients because of its strong economy. State lawmakers also voted to provide Medicaid coverage for children living in the country illegally starting Jan. 1, adding another $27 million in costs.",

Now, with the reduction of a federal match that covered those enrollees, the state is calling on voters to decide how to pay for its ballooning Medicaid costs. A special election on Tuesday asks Oregonians whether they approve of a tax on hospitals, health insurers and managed care companies that would leave Medicaid, as it is now, untouched. More than 1 in 4 residents here rely on it. Maine voters were in the national spotlight when they recently approved Medicaid expansion. But experts say Oregon's election is the only instance of voters \u2014 not lawmakers \u2014 getting the final say on the complicated question of how to fund rising Medicaid costs. The outcome could have significant consequences for the state's health care spending. \"If it's not supported, you have a huge hole, and where do you go from there?\" said Stacey Mazer, senior staff associate with the National Association of State Budget Officers. \"I followed these issues starting in the fall, and this was the biggie.\" Measure 101 would impose a 0.7 percent tax on some hospitals and a 1.5 percent tax on the gross health insurance premiums collected by insurers and on managed care organizations, raising anywhere from $210 million to $320 million over the next two years. Proponents call the tax an \"assessment\" and say money raised could cover the more than 350,000 low-income Oregonians who were added to the plan since 2014 while state lawmakers work out a long-term solution. The loss of that revenue could jeopardize an additional $630 million to $960 million in federal Medicaid matching funds that flow to the poorest in the state, according to the nonpartisan voter pamphlet. That possibility prompted the very hospitals and health insurers who would be taxed to come out as the measure's biggest backers. They say the cost of the taxes would be less than that of uninsured emergency-room visits. The ballot measure arose from a grassroots campaign to put parts of a bipartisan legislative funding solution passed last year before voters. Republican Rep. Julie Parrish and several colleagues were angered by portions of the bill that exempt large, self-insured corporations like Nike from Medicaid taxes but not Oregonians who buy insurance on health care exchanges. They also believe hospitals and insurers will pass the cost to consumers, despite language that limits premium rate increases to 1.5 percent. Parrish, who represents a Portland suburb, spearheaded the drive to collect more than 84,000 signatures to get the measure on the ballot. Her cellphone number appears in the official voter's guide with a note urging voters to call her with questions. People who support Measure 101 have raised $2.8 million. Parrish and her allies have raised $353,000. \"This is not a 'We hate Medicaid' referendum,\" Parrish said. \"This is about the fact that our colleagues put forward some pieces of the funding package that we believed to be unfair, unequitable and unsustainable.\" Portland resident Kelly Burke disagrees. She briefly lost her insurance when she was pregnant with her second child years ago. She now has a serious auto-immune disease and is thankful she has insurance through her partner's employer. \"What people don't understand is that people are working, but they still can't afford health care,\" she said.

            "article_content": "North Carolina Republicans have infuriated liberal activists by slashing income-tax rates, defending illegally gerrymandered districts and passing a now-partially repealed \"bathroom bill\" aimed at transgender people. But GOP legislators surprised critics by acting more like lawmakers in a deep-blue state when they passed a $15-per-hour \"living wage\" for about 10,000 state government and university system employees, including secretaries, hospital workers, security guards and housekeepers. At least four other states have steps already in place to increase pay for state workers to $15. But North Carolina sped to the front of the line, with salary bumps for many arriving in their late-July paychecks. The lawmakers' motives appear to be both economic and political. One top budget writer at the legislature says it helps state agencies retain veteran workers doing often-thankless jobs. But it also wins favor with North Carolina's chief state employees' union in an election year for Republicans trying to hold onto their control of the General Assembly. Until now, the North Carolina state employee salary floor was about $24,300, or about $11.70 per hour. That means some received as much as a 28 percent raise to bring them up to the new minimum equivalent of $31,200 per year. For Gloria Dockery, who cleans buildings at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for less than $28,000 a year, an increase will make it easier to cover her house payment and even treat herself occasionally. \"About the time you pay all of your bills, it's gone,\" said Dockery, 58. \"We should have a little change in our pocket. ... It sure would help me a lot.\" GOP leaders who control the General Assembly have shown no interest in raising the minimum wage for all employees above the $7.25 federal level. So why are they doing so for state workers? \"It's hard to recruit and maintain good employees,\" said Sen. Harry Brown of Jacksonville, a top budget writer. \"We've lost some good employees ... to the private sector.\" Ratcheting up the minimum wage benefited around 10 percent of the state government workforce but only cost $15 million, legislators said. It also puts Republican lawmakers in the good graces of the 50,000-member State Employees Association of North Carolina. \"You're seeing a confluence of economics and politics, and if it ends up this small amount of money helped the Republicans retain their veto-proof majorities in the legislature, then to them it was well worth it,\" said Eric Heberlig, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Republicans embraced the \"living wage\" phrase despite sharing little with the \"Fight for 15\" movement that started in 2012. Since then more than 20 states and 40 cities have raised their minimum wages for millions of state and nongovernment workers, according to the National Employment Law Project. San Francisco became the first major city last month to reach $15. \"It's a popular issue ... for the electorate across the political spectrum,\" said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, a law project attorney. New York, California and Massachusetts are increasing the pay of state government workers in phases as their minimum wage for nongovernment employees simultaneously rises. The government raises in the three states and Pennsylvania are expected to reach $15 per hour starting in mid-2021 to 2024. State workers in New York City will reach the $15 threshold at the end of this year. The liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimates 1.7 million North Carolina workers would benefit if the statewide minimum wage for all workers reached $15 by 2024. \"The big question that legislators have to answer is why they think some people in North Carolina deserve a living wage and others do not,\" said Allan Freyer with the North Carolina Justice Center, which lobbies for the poor. Still, he called the uptick for state workers a \"great first step.\" Brown said the GOP philosophy is that employers should make their own pay decisions. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper supports a minimum wage increase but hasn't talked much about how high it should go. Cooper vetoed the state budget containing the $15 wage, in part because Republicans wouldn't suspend planned tax cuts for the highest wage earners and for corporations. Collective bargaining by North Carolina state workers is prohibited, but the State Employees Association and smaller North Carolina Public Service Workers Union have sought $15 per hour for years. Association executive director Robert Broome pitched the idea to Republicans as a way to help workers living near the poverty level \u2014 currently $25,100 for a family of four \u2014 share the benefits of state GOP tax-and-spending policies that have resulted in revenue surpluses and corporation windfalls. Broome said the association has a proud history backing those \"who champion the issues and policies that are important to state employees and retirees, regardless of their political affiliation.\" For Sekia Royall, 48, a food worker at Cherry state mental hospital in Goldsboro, her projected $4,000 annual raise will help get a little more spending money to a daughter in college and support Royall's side catering business. \"It's a little extra to help through the month,\" Royall said.",

            "article_content": "We are closely watching several types of districts in the race for control of the House of Representatives. We have identified competitive House races from coast to coast, as part of the CBS News/YouGov 2018 Battleground Tracker, which polls voters across the country and then applies a\u00a0statistical model\u00a0to\u00a0rate each congressional race\u00a0and\u00a0estimate how many seats each party is favored to win. We have organized these districts into groups based on their demographic profiles, voting history, and chances of flipping. With less than a week to go until Election Day, here are the groups of districts we are watching, as well as a couple of illustrative races in each group. CA 45, CA 48, CA 49, CO 6, GA 6, IL 6, KS 3, MI 11, MN 3, NE 2, NJ 7, NJ 11, OH 12, PA 1, TX 7, TX 32, VA 10 This large group of affluent, suburban districts is crucial for the Democrats to retake the House. While these districts all elected Republicans to the House in 2016, they mostly cast presidential votes for Hillary Clinton (her average vote share: 51 percent). On average, 46 percent of residents are college educated, a group breaking heavily towards Democrats this year. According to our model, most scenarios in which Democrats take the House also have them winning several of these races. CO 6: Republicans believe that some strong incumbents like GOP Rep. Mike Coffman can push through national headwinds, having experienced tough elections before and maintaining an image above partisan politics in their districts. However, Coffman is running against a well-funded challenger, Jason Crow, in an Aurora-based district that Hillary Clinton carried by 10 points. It is looking like a pretty tough storm for Republicans to weather here. GA 6: Republicans proved that they could hold one of the most highly educated districts in the country when Karen Handel won last year's House special election in Georgia's 6th congressional district. Republicans need to prove they can continue to hold such seats two years into Donald Trump's presidency, and this time, when the race is no longer the center of national attention. AR 2, IA 1, IL 12, KS 2, ME 2, NY 22, PA 8, PA 10, WA 3, WA 5, WV 3 Donald Trump carried these mostly white, working-class districts in 2016, often by large margins (his average vote share: 58 percent). Democrats have made inroads in these types of districts in recent special elections, buoying their hopes of flipping some this year (though they only outright won a single House special, in Pennsylvania). While Republicans are favored in most of these races, some of them look like complete toss-ups. IA 1: While white, working-class voters flocked to Trump in 2016, Democrats believe the right candidate can win them back. Barack Obama carried Iowa's 1st Congressional District in 2012, but the district then flipped to Trump. State Rep. Abby Finkenauer, the daughter of a pipefitter welder, thinks her local roots and support from labor groups will help her defeat incumbent Rod Blum. Indeed, this race is the most likely to flip from Republican to Democratic among this group.\u00a0 KS 2: Sam Brownback is not governor anymore, but he has left a legacy that has turned into a bit of a headache for Kansas Republicans. Democrat Paul Davis has carried the 2nd district previously (when he lost the 2014 gubernatorial race). He is now running for Rep. Lynn Jenkins' newly open seat against Republican Steve Watkins, who keeps landing in hot water in the press. CA 10, CA 21, CA 25, CA 39, FL 26, FL 27, NM 2, TX 23 These are places with large minority populations, particularly Latinos (who make up an average of 47 percent of district residents). Most are majority-minority districts that Hillary Clinton carried. The big question is whether Latinos and other nonwhite voters defy historical midterm patterns and turn out in large enough numbers to flip these seats from red to blue. CA 21: Despite the fact that he is running as a Democrat in a majority-minority congressional district that Hillary Clinton carried, T.J. Cox is the underdog in his race against Republican Rep. David Valadao. Cox has run as a local job creator and believes he would have the resources to oust the incumbent, but Democrats have better opportunities elsewhere in this group, and in California. CA 39: On paper, California's 39th district should be an easy win for Democrats: it is an open seat in a racially diverse, suburban district that Hillary Clinton carried. However, Republican candidate Young Kim, who was born in Korea and formerly worked with outgoing GOP Rep. Ed Royce, has run a strong campaign and maintained connections with the district's sizeable Asian-American community. Meanwhile, Democrat Gil Cisneros came out of the primary with some bumps and bruises, though he is also a lottery winner who can dip into personal funds ahead of Election Day. FL 27: This race was originally a gift to Democrats, when popular Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen decided not to seek reelection in a Miami-area district, in which voters have split their tickets, voting for Democratic presidential candidates, for years. Republican nominee Maria Elvira Salazar, a local Spanish-language TV anchor, has appealed to many voters in this heavily Cuban district, resulting in a tougher fight than many Democrats anticipated here. Nonetheless, Democrats remain favored to flip this seat. NM 2: Democrats normally might not set their sights on a district this Republican, but they have a star candidate in 33-year-old Xochitl Torres-Small, who has distanced herself from the national party. She also has the benefit of running for an open seat, presenting Republican state Rep. Yvette Herrell with a formidable challenge. AZ 2, IL 14, KY 6, MI 8, MN 2, NJ 3, NY 19, NY 24, OH 1, PA 7, PA 17, VA 2, VA 7, WA 8 These middle-income and mostly white districts flip from Republican to Democrat in many of our model simulations. Hillary Clinton carried a few of them and came close in the rest (average vote share: 48 percent). Some districts include an urban component along with suburban or exurban stretches, which could help Democrats. Their most likely victories here come in open contests, of which there are four, rather than from ousting incumbents. If most of these stay red, it is a sign the Republicans could hang onto control. AZ 2: Rep. Martha McSally opted to run for the Senate instead of re-election in Arizona's 2nd Congressional District, which might have been a smart political move, given that Donald Trump carried the state but not her district. Republicans believed that Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce President Lea Marquez Peterson had a personal appeal that could defy the trend in the district, but it is looking increasingly like that the Democratic candidate, former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, will be returning to the House instead. KY 6: The results of Democrat Amy McGrath's challenge to Republican Rep. Andy Barr could help answer a couple questions: will ancestral Democrats return to the party after years of voting for Republicans (at least for federal office)? Moreover, does national stardom translate into district-level success? FL 15, IA 3, IL 13, MI 6, NC 9, NC 13, NY 11, UT 4 These are a mix of geographically larger suburban and exurban districts with Republican incumbents (three open). They mostly stay Republican in our simulations, but they are still important keep an eye on, as some could flip to Democrats in a wave election. FL 15: This race came onto the battleground map late, which benefits Democrats, due to their fundraising advantage. While Republicans are defending dozens of seats across the country, spreading their resources, Democrat Kristen Carlson has been outspending Republican state Rep. Ross Spano in an open contest, while gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum motivates nonwhite and young voters across Florida. UT 4: Utah is a conservative state that is divided on the President. Mitt Romney will likely cruise to victory in the Senate, but in Utah's 4th district, Republican Rep. Mia Love is playing defense, due to a polarizing President and a credible Democratic challenger in Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams. MN 1, MN 8, NV 3, NV 4, NH 1 There are a handful of Democratic open seats that Republicans have a good shot of flipping, mitigating likely losses in some of the groups above. President Trump carried all but one of these districts, posting large margins in the Minnesota districts, boosting Republican House candidates' hopes. MN 1: Former Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense Dan Feehan has not had an easy time trying to hold the open seat in Minnesota's 1st district for Democrats. If he manages to win, Feehan will demonstrate the importance of individual candidate profiles, at least while President Trump is in the White House. MN 8: This Duluth-area district is one of Republicans' only takeover opportunities this year, though it's increasingly looking like a good one. Former St. Louis County Commissioner Pete Stauber has taken advantage of the open race in a district Trump carried handily, while former Democratic state Rep. Joe Radinovich struggles to break through.",

            "article_content": "By Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto The estimates for the House of Representatives\u00a0come from a model, not just from a survey result. The difference between the two is that while a survey attempts to measure the whole of something by drawing a microcosm of it -- a sample -- a model takes that information and combines it with other factors about the people in the district, and the district itself more generally, to try to come up with an even better estimate of what's going on. We use a procedure called multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP), which is a fancy way of describing how it combines the information described above, and blends data about both individuals' choices, and also wider district and national factors (the \"levels\" in \"multilevel\"). We worked on this model in collaboration with Professors Ben Lauderdale, Jack Blumenau, and Doug Rivers, as well as YouGov's Data Science team. We extend the models they developed for the U.K. election in 2015 and the U.S election in 2016. Here's a primer on how it works. (For a more technical description, see the many writings of Andrew Gelman.) The first step is to talk to many people across the country. There are over 60 congressional districts where the race between Democrats and Republicans is either likely to be competitive or might become close. That's a generously large number \u2013 not all of these districts will flip \u2013 but it's within the range of the possible. We surveyed close to 6,000 voters across all these possibly competitive districts. We also collected nearly 25,000 interviews across the country, including in places outside the competitive districts, to learn about voters everywhere else. We asked them whether they are planning to vote Democratic or Republican in the House election in the district where they live. The next step is to figure out how the way people vote depends on their measurable characteristics. These characteristics include age, gender, race, education, who they voted for in 2016, where they live, and so on. Each voter has a certain combination of these, which we'll call their \"profile\" for shorthand. For example, one voter profile is someone who is 60 years old, female, white, college educated, a resident of New Jersey's 7th congressional district, and a Republican voter in 2016. If you change any of these characteristics, you get a different profile. For each of the many possible profiles, we calculate how many intend to vote Democratic and how many intend to vote Republican this year. A nice feature of MRP is that it efficiently combines information about similar types of voters no matter where they live in the country. This is particularly helpful in districts where we got fewer interviews. So if we know a lot about, let's say, white working class voters, we can assume they have some commonalities, because opinions rarely stop at district or even state boundaries, especially as our politics becomes more nationalized. If we have a good estimate of this subgroup across the country, we can improve our estimate of the subgroup for any particular district. We also add local factors, which are important too, such as past party vote in the district and whether or not there's an incumbent running this year. The next step is estimating how many people with each voter profile live in each congressional district, again using Census data and other auxiliary data (We augment these data by imputing 2016 turnout and vote choice using Current Population Survey and YouGov data, plus the knowledge of how many people voted for each party in each congressional district and state in 2016.) That helps us determine each party's vote share in a district. In each district, we multiply the number of people of a given profile by the proportions of voters with that profile choosing the Democrats and Republicans. When we add up these numbers across all voter profiles in the district, we get an estimate of each party's vote share there. Each of the steps in this process has some statistical uncertainty, which we incorporate into our final estimates. In the final step, we simulate the congressional elections 1,000 times and count how many seats each party wins in each simulation. Our seats estimate comes from the average simulation, and the range of results gives us a sense of what's possible. (We report a 90% confidence interval, by using the range between the 5th and 95th percentile of simulated results.) There are a couple of important caveats about this method. First, we are estimating how the race for the House stands as of now, with the expectation that things will change in the coming months. There is still plenty of time left before the midterms, during which more primaries will occur and voters will become more familiar with the candidates running in their districts. Second, we are estimating which voters are likely to show up at the polls in November based on recent historical patterns (this is known as a likely voter model). We estimate the proportion of voters of each profile who will turn out using a similar model based on individual-level and geographic variables. Down the road, we'll consider the implications of different turnout scenarios for which party wins the House. For example, if Democrats can replicate the turnout patterns in a presidential year or come close to it, they will improve their chances of winning the House. Republicans, on the other hand, are hoping for a turnout pattern more like a typical midterm year.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders is embarking on a nine-state battleground tour on behalf of Democratic candidates competing in the November elections, returning to the campaign trail ahead of a decision on another White House bid. The packed October schedule marks the Vermont independent's most extensive stretch of campaigning since the 2016 presidential race. It will include stops in Iowa and South Carolina, home to crucial early contests on the 2020 primary calendar. Sanders is expected to make a decision on whether to launch another campaign in the coming months and the tour could inform his decision. It will allow him to test the durability of the left-leaning coalition he assembled in 2016 and build relationships with elected officials who could serve as allies should he run again. \"He wanted to go where he thinks he can be helpful in energizing the base and bringing in young people and independent voters and working-class voters who supported him,\" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' 2016 campaign manager and longtime political adviser. Weaver said Sanders had \"no timeline or deadline\" for making a decision on 2020 but much of his consideration was focused on who is best able to defeat President Donald Trump. \"His message has reached across the Democratic base and positions him well were he to decide to run in the primary but also in the general election as the candidate who can best beat Trump,\" he said. Sanders' challenge to Hillary Clinton made him the main alternative in the 2016 Democratic primaries, but the next presidential campaign is expected to be a wide-open contest that could include several senators such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, plus former Vice President Joe Biden, other members of Congress, governors and mayors. Sanders has been at the center of a debate over the party's future and whether his agenda of free college tuition, a $15 hourly minimum wage and a \"Medicare for all\" health care can win over general-election voters. The senator is coming off a victory after Amazon announced last week it would raise its wages for its workers to $15 per hour starting next month, and will raise pay for employees who make more than that, responding in part to pressure from Sanders. The tour kicks off on Oct. 19 in Bloomington, Indiana, and Ann Arbor, Michigan, with rallies and events on behalf of Liz Watson, who is challenging Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind., and Gretchen Whitmer, who is running for Michigan governor. Sanders will hold rallies and other events in South Carolina and Iowa on Oct. 20-21, including stops in Iowa in Sioux City, Fort Dodge and Ames on behalf of J.D. Scholten, who is challenging Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. His Iowa visit, his first since February, will come amid a boost of political activity in the caucus state, including Booker, who addressed Democratic activists last weekend, and Trump, who will hold a rally in Council Bluffs on Tuesday night. The itinerary will also include rallies in Wisconsin, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and California, spanning a number of competitive races key to Democrats' electoral success. He will be campaigning alongside Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin; David Garcia, who faces Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey; Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo.; and Jacky Rosen, who is aiming to unseat Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev. Sanders' California swing will help Rep. Barbara Lee and two California congressional hopefuls, Ammar Campa-Najjar and Mike Levin. Through early October, Sanders has traveled to 17 states in support of Democratic candidates and an array of policy issues. An online fundraising powerhouse in 2016, Sanders has maintained a list of millions of his supporters that he can use to help endorsed candidates. Sanders is heavily favored to win re-election next month to a third term as Vermont's senator, allowing him to travel the nation in the weeks before the election. Sanders has called Trump a \"pathological liar\" who has bitterly divided the nation on social policies while overseeing an economic agenda that has further aggravated income and wealth inequality. \"We are clearly in an unprecedented moment in American history, a very, very dangerous moment. We have an unstable president who is a liar, who has very strong authoritarian tendencies,\" Sanders said during a campaign event in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, last month. But he said there has been a \"waking up among the American people, a desire to move this country in a very different direction, a disgust with the movement of this country toward oligarchy.\"",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden is in Kingston, New York, Friday to rally for Democratic congressional candidate Antonio Delgado, who is challenging freshman Republican Rep. John Faso in one of the most hotly contested races in the country. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates the race as a \"toss up.\" The race has divided the district's largely white district, as Delgado has been targeted in racially charged ads for his brief career as a rapper. At his event for Delgado, Biden -- often considered an avatar of the Democratic white working class -- will likely make the case that Delgado is not a suspicious outsider, but a candidate with working class roots similar to his own. In his statement announcing his visit to the 19th Congressional District, Biden emphasized that \"Antonio and I were both raised in working class families, not too far apart, and I know that he has what it takes to make a real difference for people in upstate New York.\" Delgado cemented the comparison between the two in his statement on the trip, saying \"Vice President Biden grew up just south of here, in Scranton, and understands the struggles and concerns of the working folks in our region.\" Biden is currently seen as one of the few Democrats who still appeals to white working class voters, a demographic which conventional wisdom says has pivoted away from the Democratic Party and towards President Trump. The former vice president and potential future presidential contender has been ramping up his campaign presence before the midterm elections, visiting states with closely watched races. While many of the voters here are technically middle class, this upstate New York district is conservative, but not particularly Republican. It voted for Obama twice and then swung to Mr. Trump in 2016. \u00a0 Delgado is a Rhodes scholar and a graduate of Harvard Law School who worked at a prominent lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C. However, the line on his resume which has garnered the most attention is his brief career as a rapper under the stage name \"AD the Voice\" in 2007. Delgado released an album which featured lyrics that criticized the United States for its history of racism. When details of Delgado's rap career were revealed in July, Faso said that the views he presented in his music were \"inconsistent with the views of the people of the 19th District and America.\" A prominent political scientist at SUNY New Paaltz, Gerald Benjamin,\u00a0told the New York Times\u00a0in July that \"this is about culture and commonality with the district and its values.\" \"Is a guy who makes a rap album the kind of guy who lives here in rural New York and reflects our lifestyle and values?\" Benjamin said. He added that \"people like us, people in rural New York,\" did not agree with these values. Benjamin later walked back those statements.\u00a0 The attacks against Delgado continued with ads from the National Republican Congressional Committee on Faso's behalf, which had racial undertones. An ad\u00a0released in early September spliced clips from Delgado's campaign videos with one of his old music videos. It ended with split screen with \"campaign\" Delgado compared to \"rapper\" Delgado. The ad prominently features an image of Delgado as a rapper, showing him in a hoodie, with part of his face in the shadows. Even though the NRCC was\u00a0accused of racism\u00a0on social media over the ad, it continued with this line of attack in an ad released in early October, which characterized him as a \"big-city rapper.\" To those swayed by the NRCC ads, Delgado may seem like a figure who cannot relate to the concerns of white rural voters, particularly those without college degrees. The race for New York's 19th Congressional District is extremely close, with a Siena College poll from earlier this month showing Faso up by one point. Faso has the support of 53 percent of voters without a bachelor's degree, while Delgado has the support of 54 percent of voters with a college degree. The district is around 84 percent white. According to the 2017 American Community Survey, among those 25 years and older in the district, 70 percent do not have a bachelor's degree. An endorsement and campaign event with Biden might help Delgado appeal to white voters who may see him more as a big-city rapper than viable congressional candidate.

            "article_content": "With two weeks until the midterm elections in which his party's control of Congress is at stake, President Trump has introduced a new rallying cry on the campaign trial -- the promise of a new middle-class tax cut to be considered by Congress. \"We are going to be putting in a 10 percent tax cut for middle income families,\" the president said at a rally Monday night in Texas for Ted Cruz's re-election campaign. \"It's going to be put in next week. Ten percent tax cut. Kevin Brady is working on it. We have been working on it for a few months. That is in addition to the big tax cuts you have already gotten.\" His first mention of a new tax cut came over the weekend, when he told reporters after a rally in Nevada that \"we are studying very deeply right now round-the-clock a major tax cut for middle income people,\" adding that it would happen sometime before November. Since then, he has continued to stress the tax plans in comments with reporters and in political rallies. On Monday, when told Congress was on recess, Mr. Trump said that the tax cut would happen after the election. But neither the president nor his Republican allies on Capitol Hill have offered details of this plan, and Congress' focus has shifted to its battle over which party will control the House of Representatives and Senate for the remainder of the president's first term.\u00a0 Late Tuesday afternoon, the chairman of the House's tax writing committee, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, released a statement with vague language that only committed to working to develop such a tax cut.\u00a0 \"We will continue to work with the White House and Treasury over the coming weeks to develop an additional 10 percent tax cut focused specifically on middle-class families and workers, to be advanced as Republicans retain the House and Senate,\" his statement said. The 2017 tax law is the central Republican legislative accomplishment that candidates -- and the president -- are highlighting ahead of the elections. The law, which took effect at the beginning of 2018, cut taxes for corporations and wealthy Americans. The $1.5 trillion package also provided smaller tax cuts for middle and low income people and families. In that law, the tax cuts for individuals would expire after 2025. Leaving the White House for Texas on Monday, Mr. Trump stressed that this was not a business proposal. \"We're doing it now for middle-income people. This is not for business. This is for the middle.\" Republicans have already tried to\u00a0push through another tax cut before hitting the campaign trial, pressing a bill in the House of Representatives that would expand the law by making permanent the individual and small-business tax cuts. The bill did not get the same reception in the Senate, where Republicans hold a very slim majority. Mr. Trump said over the weekend he wanted to move forward with the plan \"sometime around\" or before Nov. 1. Congress out of session through the Nov. 6 elections. The Treasury Department released numbers last week that showed the federal budget deficit rose to $779 billion in fiscal year 2018, amid a decline in corporate tax revenues. Republicans continue to say\u00a0that the tax cut will ultimately pay for itself by improving the economy. Rebecca Kaplan and Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "MADISON, Wis. \u2014 Democrats are fighting to beat back Republican gains across the Midwest as the 2018 primary season roars through Wisconsin and Minnesota, two states where President Trump's appeal among working-class voters threaten to upend decades long political trends this fall and beyond. Tuesday's primary contests for governor, the U.S. Senate and the House will test the strength of Mr. Trump's fiery coalition against the energy of the Democratic resistance. At the same time, accusations of domestic violence involving the Democratic National Committee's second-in-command could undermine the blue wave in Minnesota, a state still healing from scandal. In all, four states will host primary elections Tuesday as the 2018 primary season nears its final chapter. All but 10 states will have picked their candidates for November's general election by the time all votes are counted in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Vermont and Connecticut. While the full political battlefield isn't quite set, the stakes are clear: Democrats are working to topple Republican control of Congress and governors' offices across the nation. Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee, who leads the Democratic Governors Association, predicted that Tuesday would offer fresh evidence of a blue wave that would sweep Democrats into power this November. \"Trump has managed to alienate every form of human life on the planet,\" Inslee told The Associated Press when asked about his party's appeal among white working-class voters. \"They're tired of this chaos.\" Democrats appear particularly motivated in Wisconsin, where eight candidates have lined up for the chance to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a two-term incumbent who has warned his party about the prospect of a blue wave. Walker's strong anti-union policies made him a Democratic villain long before Mr. Trump's rise. State schools chief Tony Evers, who has clashed with Walker at times, enters the primary as the best-known of the eight Democratic candidates. Once a target of Trump criticism, Walker gained the president's endorsement in a tweet Monday night, Mr. Trump calling him \"a tremendous Governor who has done incredible things for that Great State\" on the eve of the primary. But Mr. Trump's persistent attacks on Wisconsin-based motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson put Republican candidates on their heels in recent days, Walker among them. Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday that it was \"great\" that many Harley owners planned to boycott the Milwaukee company if manufacturing moves overseas, continuing a monthslong tariff dispute with the beloved American motorcycle manufacturer. Walker avoided addressing the boycott call directly in a written response. His Democratic opponents embraced the fight. \"By attacking Wisconsin workers to cover for failed economic policy, President Trump took a page right out of Scott Walker's playbook,\" said Mahlon Mitchell, one of the candidates and the head of the state firefighters union. Mr. Trump also stars, informally at least, in Wisconsin's Senate primaries as Republicans try to deny Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin a second term. The GOP primary features fervent Trump supporters: former Marine Kevin Nicholson, running as an outsider, and longtime state lawmaker Leah Vukmir, who is backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. While neither candidate was an early Trump supporter, Vukmir has struggled to explain footage recently unearthed from 2016 in which she calls Mr. Trump \"offensive to everyone.\" Tuesday's primaries serve as a test of Democratic enthusiasm in the upper Midwest, a region that has long been associated with liberal politics but has been trending red. Mr. Trump won Wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point in 2016, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to carry the state since 1984. It's much the same in Minnesota, where Mr. Trump lost by less than 3 percentage points in a state that hadn't backed a Republican presidential contender since 1972. Minnesota voters will pick candidates in competitive races for governor, the Senate and the House. But a down-ballot race for state attorney general may overshadow them all. Rep. Keith Ellison, the Democratic National Committee's deputy chairman, was expected to capture his party's nomination in the race to become the state's top law enforcement official. That was before Ellison's candidacy was rocked by allegations of domestic violence over the weekend amid a broader national outcry against sexual misconduct by powerful men in business, entertainment and politics. Ellison has denied an ex-girlfriend's allegations that he dragged her off a bed while screaming obscenities during a 2016 relationship she said was plagued by \"narcissistic abuse.\" Allegations of misconduct are still fresh in Minnesota, where Democratic Sen. Al Franken resigned in December after multiple allegations of unwanted sexual touching. His replacement, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, is on Tuesday's ballot as she seeks her first full term. She's facing Democrat Richard Painter, a former George W. Bush ethics lawyer. Former two-term Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty may be the biggest name on Minnesota's ballot, however. He's the leading Republican candidate in the high-profile race to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton. Having lost his own short-lived bid for president in 2012, Pawlenty spent much of the last six years serving as a top corporate lobbyist. Like Republican candidates elsewhere, Pawlenty has struggled to live down his blistering critique of Mr. Trump in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election. At the time, he called Mr. Trump \"unhinged and unfit for the presidency.\" Pawlenty has since said he voted for Mr. Trump and supports his agenda. The Democratic field for governor features U.S. Rep. Tim Walz, state Rep. Erin Murphy and Attorney General Lori Swanson. Not to be forgotten: Deep-blue Vermont and Connecticut hold primary contests as well. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who hasn't ruled out a second presidential run in 2020, is seeking his third term in the Senate. The 76-year-old democratic socialist is running for the Democratic nomination, but he is expected to turn it down and run as an independent. In Connecticut, five Republicans have lined up to replace the unpopular outgoing governor, Democrat Dan Malloy. The Democratic field features former gubernatorial candidate Ned Lamont and Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim, who served several years in prison for political corruption.",

            "article_content": "PARIS \u2014 President Emmanuel Macron broke his silence Monday on the exceptional protests shaking France and his presidency, promising broad tax relief for struggling workers and pensioners \u2014  and acknowledging his own responsibility in fueling the nation's anger. Speaking with a soft voice and gentle tone, Macron pleaded during a brief televised address for a return to calm after almost four weeks of protests that started in neglected provinces to oppose fuel tax increases and progressed to rioting in Paris. \"We are at a historic moment for our country,\" the French leader said from the capital's presidential Elysee Palace. \"We will not resume the normal course of our lives\" after all that has happened. Protesters spent days demanding that Macron speak publicly about their concerns, but it's unclear whether the responses he offered will be enough to quell the dissatisfaction. Some protest representatives have said more demonstrations will be held Saturday, following the ones in Paris that turned violent during the previous two weekends. Macron declared an \"economic and social state of emergency,\" ordering the government and parliament to take immediate steps to change tax rules and other policies that hit the wallets of working class French people. He responded to several of the protesters' demands, promising measures including: \"I take my share of responsibility for the anger gripping France,\" Macron said, an unusual admission for a president accused of being out-of-touch. \"I might have hurt people with my words.\" However, the centrist leader insisted the protesters' \"malaise\" is as old as he is \u2014  40 years \u2014  and coincides with France struggling in recent decades to keep up with globalization. And he denounced the protest-associated violence that led to hundreds of injuries, more than 1,000 arrests and the ransacking of stores in some of Paris' richest neighborhoods. Authorities will show \"no indulgence\" to those behind the vandalism and rioting, Macron said, adding that \"no anger justifies\" attacking police or looting stores. The president's long silence since the first protests last month aggravated that anger. Many protesters hoped only to hear one thing Monday from Macron: \"I quit.\" He showed no signs of giving in. Instead, he defended his political independence and described his devotion to serving France. No French presidential or parliamentary elections are scheduled until 2022. Graffiti scrawled throughout the French capital singles Macron out for criticism, reflecting a national sense that the former banker is arrogant and removed from public concerns. But he has appeared out determined to continue trying to make the French economy more competitive globally. Before his TV speech, Macron met with local and national politicians and with union and business leaders to hear their concerns \u2014  but with no representatives of the scattered, leaderless protest movement. Many have been calling for Macron to step down, CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports. His approval rating has plunged to around 20 percent. Now the students are joining in. The Education Ministry reported disruptions in around 120 schools across the country Monday, including dozens that were blockaded by students. CBS News visited the Universit\u00e9 Paris Nanterre, where students blockaded buildings and staged a mass walkout, right in the middle of what would be end-of-term exams. They're protesting education reforms that include a fee hike, particularly for foreign students. They told us it's not only unfair, they fear it will open the door to increased tuition fees for French students. They pulled temporary fencing over doorways, setting off skirmishes with school security guards. It wasn't much of a physical blockade, but it was enough to send the message that the college is closed for business. Small business representatives lamented the blow the demonstrations were dealing to retail and other companies at the height of the Christmas shopping season. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said new measures should focus on helping France's working classes. \"We are ready to make any gesture\" that works, he said on RTL radio. \"What is important now is to put an end to the crisis and find peace and unity in the country again.\" Fallout from the protests so far could cost France 0.1 percent of gross domestic product in the last quarter of the year, Le Maire warned. \"That means fewer jobs, it means less prosperity for the whole country,\" he said. The yellow vest protests began in November against a rise in fuel taxes \u2014  which Macron retreated from last week \u2014  but mushroomed into a plethora of sometimes contradictory demands. Lately, they have included Macron's resignation. \"Macron is there for the rich, not for all the French,\" 68-year-old retiree Jean-Pierre Meunuer said at Saturday's protest in Paris. With the new demonstrations planned Saturday, some police officers who spent multiple weekends on crowd and riot patrol are calling for their own tax-exempt overtime pay. Key Paris tourist sites reopened Sunday, including the Louvre museum and the Eiffel Tower, while workers cleaned up tons of debris from Saturday's protests, which left widespread damage in the capital and elsewhere. French media reported that 136,000 protesters took to the streets nationwide Saturday.",

The right-wing host of \"America Talks Live\" on NewsmaxTV posted a photo of Ocasio-Cortez's childhood home, and observed that it's \"a far cry from the Bronx hood upbringing she's selling.\"\u00a0 In describing the small one-story ranch home, he tweeted, \"This is the Yorktown Heights (very nice area) home\u00a0@Ocasio2018\u00a0grew up in before going off to Ivy League Brown University.\u00a0 \"A far cry from the Bronx hood upbringing she's selling.\" This is the Yorktown Heights (very nice area) home @Ocasio2018 grew up in before going off to Ivy League Brown University.

But Ocasio-Cortez attended and graduated from Boston University -- which is not an Ivy League school -- in 2011. The nominee responded in a tweet with two points: \"1. I didn't go to Brown or the Ivy League. I went to BU. Try Google.\" And \"2. It is nice. Growing up, it was a good town for working people. My mom scrubbed toilets so I could live here & I grew up seeing how the zip code one is born in determines much of their opportunity.\" Hey John,1. I didn\u2019t go to Brown or the Ivy League.

My mom scrubbed toilets so I could live here & I grew up seeing how the zip code one is born in determines much of their opportunity. The 28-year-old Democratic socialist made headlines last week after defeating incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-New York, in the primary election for New York's 14th Congressional District, which encompasses the Bronx and Queens. Ocasio-Cortez also elaborated on her time growing up in the home by saying that it was a good area for working class people and that her mother cleaned toilets to be able to afford living there. She ended the conversation with one more tweet, eviscerating Cardillo for questioning her authenticity. \"Your attempt to strip me of my family, my story, my home, and my identity is exemplary of how scared you are of the power of all four of those things,\" she tweeted. 3. Your attempt to strip me of my family, my story, my home, and my identity is exemplary of how scared you are of the power of all four of those things. Soon afterward, Cardillo admitted flubbing Ocasio-Cortez's alma mater but added, \"that said, you're not a girl from the Bronx.\" He then extended her an invitation to come on to his show for a \"respectful debate,\" writing on Twitter that \"anyone who knows me or has watched or listened to me on air knows I'm fair.\" Ocasio-Cortez's campaign website says that she was \"born in the Bronx to two working-class parents\" but because of the state of Bronx public schools she ended up going to school 40 minutes away, in Yorktown.  \"It was clear to her, even then, that the zip code a child was born in determined much of their destiny,\" the website reads. \"The 40 minute drive represented a vastly different quality of available schooling, economic opportunity, and health outcomes.\"  Cardillo is still tweeting about Ocasio-Cortez a day later. On Monday, he posted a tweet with pictures of lavish homes he says are also in Yorktown Heights. \"Sure, her house was small, but to claim it's not an affluent area is dishonest,\" he tweeted. \"To claim it's similar to the Bronx is ridiculous.\"   I grew up in NYC. Had friends from Yorktown Heights where @Ocasio2018 grew up. Been there many times.Sure, her house was small, but to claim it's not an affluent area is dishonest.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- It has been 50 years since\u00a0Shirley Chisholm stared down sexism and racism to become the first black congresswoman in history. Today, members of Congress say they carry her lessons with them. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, told CBS News that Chisholm encouraged those around her to be \"tree-shakers\" and \"changemakers.\" Jackson Lee said that mentality was evident in Chisholm's first marquee squabble in 1969 as the urban congresswoman took on party leadership when she was appointed to the Forestry and Rural Villages committee.\u00a0 With hard work and by recognizing the poverty in her district, Chisholm used the committee placement to help institute federal nutritional food programs that are still used by millions today.  \"Many of us who started at the bottom, as women came in, we were always in the junior seat,\" Jackson Lee said, \"I think what she taught me was you came there to do- respect your colleagues, but do what you have to do and move forward.\"  Not long after she entered Congress in 1969, Chisholm decided to disrupt political mores again in 1972. She ran for president.   A stop on Chisholm's campaign trail was through a Mills College government class that Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif, was taking. Lee told CBS News that she was set to flunk out of the course at the time because she was uninspired by the other 1972 candidates and the course required campaign work. However \"[Chisholm] talked about all the issues that were resonating with me as a young, African American, single mom on public assistance,\" Lee said.   Even though their relationship started with Chisholm scolding Lee for not registering to vote that year, Lee served as a convention delegate and worked on her campaign. Roughly 20 years later, Chisholm reciprocated the support and campaigned several times for Lee's own elections.  \"Every day I'm reminded she would say, 'These rules [and] these laws inside were not made for you, they weren't made for me,'\" Lee said. \"'So you've got to get in there and shake things up.'\"  Another 1972 convention delegate was Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas. While Johnson officially supported Hubert Humphrey, she also found personal encouragement in Chisholm, as Johnson was fresh off a Texas House of Representatives primary win.  \"[She] made me feel pretty legitimate,\" Johnson said. \"It made me feel that it is possible to get out and generate some respect and feel confident about being heard.\"  Chisholm served seven terms in Congress. Her former colleague, Rep. Charles Rangel, told CBS News he was certain Chisholm was \"not treated fairly\" by fellow congressmen but that she \"made lemonade out of lemons.\"  \"I knew that she believed that women don't have to take a back seat to anybody,\" Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, said. \"Her slogan was 'unbought and unbossed,' and it's something we still say today.\"   After Congress, she continued to make an indelible impact on politics and culture.  Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who represents a part of Chisholm's Brooklyn district, said he was first cognizant of her impact while listening to hip hop artist Biz Markie in the 1980s. He said the lyrics \"Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm\" capture the \"cultural importance of Chisholm that was penetrated beyond those who followed politics closely.\"  Her impact, according to Jeffries, laid the foundation for years to come.\u00a0 \"Barack Obama completed the job that Shirley Chisholm started,\" he said.  Jeffries said for decades there has been a friendly rivalry between his and Rep. Yvette Clarke's predecessors over who is the rightful heir to the original Chisholm turf that was split up after she left office. \"We've concluded that Shirley Chisholm was such a bad sister it took two members of Congress to replace her,\" Jeffries quipped.  Clarke told CBS News a \"pride of service\" is still present today in her district. As the daughter of Caribbean immigrants, Chisholm helped change how the immigrant community was perceived and showed everyone how they could be successful Americans, according to Clarke.  \"Her run for Congress actually extended the Voting Rights Act into the Northeast,\" Clarke said. For efforts like those, Clarke and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-CA. introduced a bill earlier this year to install a statue of Chisholm for display inside the U.S. Capitol.  And while Chisholm was certainly a serious woman, her lighter side is remembered, too. A few senior members told Clarke about the former congresswoman's passion for classic ballroom dancing. \"I hear she was awesome,\" Clarke said.   Several members said the legacy of Chisholm will be on wide display this midterm election as scores of minority women are running for office across the country. \"We stand on the shoulders of Shirley Chisholm,\" Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., said as she traveled the country campaigning for these candidates.  Before Chisholm's death on January 1, 2005, the former congresswoman was honored with a unanimously-passed House resolution introduced by Lee.

            "article_content": "The security chief for the head of the Environmental Protection Agency worked on the side as a private investigator for the owner of a tabloid news company with close ties to President Donald Trump. EPA special agent Pasquale \"Nino\" Perrotta performed regular work for National Enquirer publisher American Media Inc. during the 2016 election, according to person with knowledge of the company's internal workings. But unlike another private investigator hired by the Enquirer, Perrotta didn't work on such newsroom projects as tracking down sources. Instead, the person told The Associated Press on Tuesday, Perrotta was engaged to discretely handle investigative work at the direction of AMI chairman and CEO David Pecker. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the company's operations and spoke on condition of anonymity. The New York Times first reported Perrotta's link to AMI. In addition to his job at EPA, Perrotta is the top executive at Sequoia Security Group, a Maryland-based security firm. The person with knowledge of the situation did not know whether Perrotta was paid for his work for AMI and Pecker through Sequoia or another business entity. A former Secret Service agent, Perrotta has worked at EPA for more than a decade. He was tapped by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt last year to lead his 20-member, full-time personal protective detail. Perrotta's predecessor as Pruitt's security chief was reassigned for refusing to acquiesce to the administrator's demands for VIP treatment, including using the emergency lights on a government vehicle to speed through Washington traffic to make airline flights and dinner reservations. Perrotta did not respond late Tuesday to messages seeking comment. EPA's press office also did not respond to messages seeking comment about the security chief's side business. AP reported earlier this month that Perrotta oversaw a rapid expansion of Pruitt's security team and the taxpayer-funded precautions used to ensure his personal safety, including the use of first-class airline seats after a fellow traveler cursed at the EPA chief in an airport. Perrotta also spearheaded the purchase of a $43,000 soundproof booth for Pruitt's office to help ensure his telephone calls could not be overheard by others. The Government Accountability Office found earlier this month that the spending on the pricey privacy booth violated federal purchasing laws. Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday issued a letter questioning whether Perrotta was improperly operating an outside consulting firm without proper approval from EPA ethics officials. Under Pecker, American Media became one of the earliest and most fervent backers of Mr. Trump's political career, providing breathless coverage as far back as 2011 to Mr. Trump's promotion of the false theory that President Barack Obama might not be a U.S. citizen. During the 2016 campaign, Pecker's flagship National Enquirer was in close contact with Mr. Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen while it attacked Mr. Trump's Republican opponents from its perch in supermarket checkout aisles, printing thin allegations about Sen. Ted Cruz's personal life and alleging Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was in declining physical and mental health. AMI also helped Mr. Trump in a far less public fashion. The company paid $150,000 to a former Playboy Playmate for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with Trump during his marriage to Melania, and another $30,000 to a former Trump doorman peddling another story about Trump. AMI has denied the payments were hush money, though Pecker himself noted in a New Yorker interview last year that the contract with\u00a0Playmate Karen McDougal prevented her from \"bashing Trump.\" Records show Perrotta received clearance in March 2013 for limited nongovernment consulting work but was required to get updated approval if his job duties changed. Perrotta received a significant promotion and pay raise last year. According to the letter approving his work outside the agency, Perrotta told EPA ethics officials he expected to be \"self-employed\" to provide consulting to two to three clients for approximately three to six hours per week on issues related to cybersecurity and \"denial of service insurance.\" The 2013 approval, which was in effect for a five-year period that expired last month, also barred Perrotta from using his government position to advance his personal interests. AP reported in December that EPA paid $3,000 to contractor Edwin Steinmetz Associates last year to search Pruitt's office for secret listening devices. Steinmetz is also listed as a vice president at Perrotta's security firm. Emails obtained by congressional Democrats showed that Perrotta played a role in the decision to conduct the bug sweep, the contract for which the lawmakers allege he improperly steered to Steinmetz. Tuesday's letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who serve on a committee with oversight of EPA. They ask an agency ethics official to re-examine whether Perrotta's outside employment violates agency rules.",

            "article_content": "ERIE, Pa.\u00a0\u2014 With the abandoned smokestacks off the bay and ramshackle factories along 12th Street, it's easy to pin the blame for this industrial city's plight on the loss of manufacturing jobs to China and Mexico. Many, including President Donald Trump, hold the belief that shuttered factories are what primarily ails Erie and other aging blue-collar company towns. Yet since 2008, Erie has suffered a less-known and potentially more devastating exodus of well-paying white-collar jobs. Half its CEOs \u2014 220 jobs \u2014 have disappeared. The city has shed 8 percent of its accountants, 10 percent of its computer workers, 40 percent of its engineers and 20 percent of its lawyers, according to government data analyzed by The Associated Press. They are the professional class jobs that buttressed Erie's manufacturing might. And they are the type of work that has increasingly become the backbone of the U.S. economy. After reviewing Labor Department figures dating to 2008, the AP found that a third of major metro areas \u2014 nearly 80 communities \u2014 are shedding a greater percentage of white-collar than blue-collar jobs. In Ohio, such cities as Toledo and Canton have had a harder time retaining jobs in offices than on factory floors. It's a similar story in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. And in Wichita and Topeka, Kansas. And Birmingham, Alabama. And Decatur, Illinois. \"That's one of the most painful aspects of the economic decline of these manufacturing centers: They get hit twice,\" said Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \"First, they lose the factories. But second, and most importantly, they lose everyone who was supportive of those factories.\" It's that second hit that increasingly matters nearly four decades since U.S. manufacturing employment peaked. Without a foundation of white-collar jobs, it becomes difficult for these areas to reinvent themselves in an era when the economy more and more requires specialized knowledge and technological skill. \"It's painful because it makes it even harder for the community to recover,\" Moretti said. Trump had rallied voters on the promise that he would restore factory jobs to revive areas that had lost them. But the data show how higher-paying occupations are abandoning smaller cities, taking with them a generation of workers who could otherwise start new companies or serve existing businesses. The AP reviewed data on employment by occupations from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and compared metro area figures with national averages. Jobs that were categorized as white collar include managerial, administrative and sales positions. Blue-collar occupations include production, craft, machine operation and transportation positions. White-collar workers are increasingly shifting from smaller cities and settling in such thriving metro areas as Seattle, Nashville, Chicago and Silicon Valley. As those higher-paying occupations become more highly concentrated, the wealth they generate is less likely to filter through the rest of the country to areas with a long-standing legacy of manufacturing. And while Trump and other political leaders vow to boost businesses with tax cuts, lower taxes may do little for communities with fewer white collar workers who could plow them into new businesses. In Erie, many business leaders say the city mainly needs to keep and attract more white-collar workers. Its largest for-profit employer, Erie Insurance, recently restored an old armory and has been renovating old homes nearby, gradually turning part of the city into a corporate campus. Out of a headquarters built as a replica of Independence Hall, with hand-blocked French wallpaper depicting an American Revolution battle, the insurer is leading a private $40 million effort to fill the downtown with apartments and retail, in hopes that a friendlier streetscape will draw more employers and college graduates. For the company's CEO, the mission is personal. Tim NeCastro has five adult children; only one has chosen to stay local. \"If this is successful, 10 years from now, two more of my kids will move to Erie,\" he said. \"They will find a reason to get back here.\" It's the same high-stakes gamble many small- and mid-size cities face. Children who left for college aren't returning home as they once did. Many are choosing to live in metro areas or communities anchored by a major university, like Pittsburgh, 130 miles south of Erie. In these larger cities, it's easier for white-collar workers to quit their jobs to join employers that offer more money or opportunities for advancement. This trend has turned certain larger cities into magnets that draw employers and better-paid workers away from smaller cities. \"Size matters, and I think, this dynamic is accelerating,\" said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Census Bureau data show, for example, that Chicago added nearly 40,000 college graduates under age 35 since the Great Recession began in late 2007. Boston gained about 10,000, Denver 25,000. Compare that with Toledo, which lost 1,600 young college graduates. In a 2016 campaign speech in Erie, Trump didn't touch on this brain drain. Rather, he blamed unfair trade \u2014 from the North American Free Trade Agreement to the entrance of China into the World Trade Organization \u2014 for the struggles in those communities. \"We will stop these countries from taking our companies,\" Trump said. \"You can't do well when you have a government that is so stupid, that is so incompetent.\" This argument helped win him Erie County, which had twice voted for Barack Obama. But in the 12 months since Trump's election, Erie has shed about 800 jobs. The number of people seeking jobs declined by more than 2,000. Trump has announced taxes on steel and aluminum imports in hopes of bolstering U.S. industry. Community leaders in Erie note that manufacturing remains a strength for northwest Pennsylvania. But it seems impossible to restore a long-gone era of prosperity that was built on factory work. Erie's General Electric locomotive plant peaked with roughly 20,000 workers just after World War II, when whirling assembly lines had helped to secure an Allied victory and an economic boom that followed helped propel growth. Hammermill Paper relied on trucks stacked with logs that rumbled through downtown to its paper mill. Lord Corp. made industrial coatings. Zurn made plumbing equipment. But as the market for locomotives declined, the GE plant steadily downsized. It will soon have a headcount closer to 3,000. Hammermill was bought by International Paper in 1986. Its jobs went to Memphis. Lord recently replaced its old plant in Erie with a new factory nearby, but its headquarters remains in North Carolina. Zurn decided in 2015 to move its base to Milwaukee because it saw Wisconsin as a hub for \"global water industry leaders.\" Many of the factory buildings are decades old, too dilapidated and maze-like to efficiently run an assembly line that needs wide-open spaces. Some long-standing factory workers in Erie earn a healthy $35 an hour. But that's more than many companies are now willing to pay for factory work, thereby limiting how much manufacturing can fuel prosperity in cities like Erie. Bob Glowacki, who heads a real estate management company and once served on Erie's city council, said the city must look beyond manufacturing. \"It's fine that Donald Trump says he's going to get all the companies that moved to China to come back to the United States,\" he said. \"But if that happened, you're only going to get 20 percent of those jobs back. Technology has replaced them. How do you change that in Erie?\" What people are truly nostalgic for, Glowacki said, isn't merely the grind of factory jobs but the community fostered by the old ethnic neighborhoods, with their churches and clubs where residents once gathered. Chain restaurants in strip malls outside the city proper have supplanted many of these institutions. Housing vacancies have risen around the downtown core. So instead, Erie's goal is now more to recapture some of those lost white-collar jobs by renovating the downtown. Business leaders see a model to replicate in the Cincinnati neighborhood of \"Over the Rhine\" with its charming Italianate brick buildings and hipster restaurants. After taking a tour through Erie's neighborhoods and industrial sites, Glowacki, 66, said he feels hopeful that the city now has a plan of action. \"I've never felt more positive about what is happening in Erie than I do right now,\" he said. Yet the fates of white-collar and blue-collar workers remain entwined. In October, GE Transportation announced layoffs for 570 unionized workers at the locomotive plant. The move accompanied the loss of 200 management jobs at the same plant, said Scott Slawson, who represents the GE workers as the president of the local union. Ripple effects from previous layoffs hit more than 40 Erie companies that helped supply the factory. The company is also seeking to divest its transportation division, which is spreading uncertainty for every class of workers in Erie. \"When that corporate jet leaves Erie, there's not room for everyone on that jet \u2014 there's very few seats,\" Slawson said.",

            "article_content": "Editor's Note: The story was originally published on March 25, 2018. A week and a half before the 2016 election, Donald Trump's personal attorney paid a porn star named Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her alleged relationship with the Republican candidate for president. Today, that arrangement is well on its way to becoming the most talked-about \"hush agreement\" in history, with potential legal and political implications for the president. Through his spokesman, Mr. Trump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels, and his lawyers are now threatening her with financial ruin, saying she has to pay $1 million every time she violates her agreement to stay silent. But that didn't stop her from coming on 60 Minutes. Anderson Cooper: For sitting here talking to me today you could be fined a million dollars. I mean, aren't you taking a big risk? Stormy Daniels: I am. Anderson Cooper: I guess I'm not 100% sure on why you're doing this. Stormy Daniels: Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself. Anderson Cooper: Is part of talking w-- wanting to set the record straight? Stormy Daniels: 100%. Anderson Cooper: Why does the record need to be set straight? Stormy Daniels: Because people are just saying whatever they wanted to say about me, I was perfectly fine saying nothing at all, but I'm not okay with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, \"Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this. Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done? \u00a0 Anderson Cooper: A lotta people are using you for a lotta different agendas. Stormy Daniels: They're trying to. Like, oh, you know, Stormy Daniels comes out #MeToo. This is not a 'Me Too.' I was not a victim. I've never said I was a victim. I think trying to use me to-- to further someone else's agenda, does horrible damage to people who are true victims. Stormy Daniels' real name is Stephanie Clifford. She's 39 years old, from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and has been acting in, directing, and writing adult films for nearly 20 years. She was one of the most popular actresses in the adult industry when she was introduced to Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in July, 2006. She says he invited her to dinner, and she met him at his hotel suite. Anderson Cooper: How was the conversation? Stormy Daniels: Ummm (LAUGH) it started off-- all about him just talking about himself. And he's like-- \"Have you seen my new magazine?\" Anderson Cooper: He was showing you his own picture on the cover of a magazine. Stormy Daniels: Right, right. And so I was like, \"Does this-- does this normally work for you?\" And he looked very taken-- taken back, like, he didn't really understand what I was saying. Like, I was, \"does, just, you know, talking about yourself normally work?\" And I was like, \"Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it.\" (LAUGH) And I'll never forget the look on his face. He was like-- Anderson Cooper: What-- what was his look? Stormy Daniels: Just, I don't think anyone's ever spoken to him like that, especially, you know, a young woman who looked like me. And I said, you know, \"Give me that,\" and I just remember him going, \"You wouldn't.\" \"Hand it over.\" And-- so he did, and I was like, \"turn around, drop 'em.\" Anderson Cooper: You-- you told Donald Trump to turn around and take off his pants. Stormy Daniels: Yes. Anderson Cooper: And did he? Stormy Daniels: Yes. So he turned around and pulled his pants down a little -- you know had underwear on and stuff and I just gave him a couple swats. Anderson Cooper: This was done in a joking manner. Stormy Daniels: Yes. And-- from that moment on, he was a completely different person. Anderson Cooper: How so? Stormy Daniels: He quit talking about himself and he asked me things and I asked him things and it just became like more appropriate. Anderson Cooper: It became more comfortable. Stormy Daniels: Yeah. He was like, \"Wow, you-- you are special. You remind me of my daughter.\" You know-- he was like, \"You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you.\" Anderson Cooper: At this point was he doing The Apprentice? Stormy Daniels: Yes. And he goes, \"Got an idea, honeybunch. Would you ever consider going on and-- and being a contestant?\" And I laughed and-- and said, \"NBC's never gonna let, you know, an adult film star be on.\" It's, you know, he goes, \"No, no,\" he goes, \"That's why I want you. You're gonna shock a lotta people, you're smart and they won't know what to expect\" Anderson Cooper: Did you think he was serious, or did you think he was kind of dangling to get you to wanna be involved him? Stormy Daniels: Both. Anderson Cooper: Melania Trump had recently given birth to-- to a son, just a few months before. Did that-- did he mention his wife or child at all in this? Stormy Daniels: I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, \"Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even-- we have separate rooms and stuff.\" Anderson Cooper: Did you two go out for dinner that night? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: You had dinner in the room? Stormy Daniels: Yes. Anderson Cooper: What happened next? Stormy Daniels: I asked him if I could use his restroom and he said, \"Yes, you know, it's through those-- through the bedroom, you'll see it.\" So I-- I excused myself and I went to the-- the restroom. You know, I was in there for a little bit and came out and he was sitting, you know, on the edge of the bed when I walked out, perched. Anderson Cooper: And when you saw that, what went through your mind? Stormy Daniels: I realized exactly what I'd gotten myself into. And I was like, \"Ugh, here we go.\" (LAUGH) And I just felt like maybe-- (LAUGH) it was sort of-- I had it coming for making a bad decision for going to someone's room alone and I just heard the voice in my head, \"well, you put yourself in a bad situation and bad things happen, so you deserve this.\" Anderson Cooper: And you had sex with him. Stormy Daniels: Yes. Anderson Cooper: You were 27, he was 60. Were you physically attracted to him? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: Not at all? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: Did you want to have sex with him? Stormy Daniels: No. But I didn't-- I didn't say no. I'm not a victim, I'm not-- Anderson Cooper: It was entirely consensual. Stormy Daniels: Oh, yes, yes. Anderson Cooper: You work in an industry where condom use is-- is an issue. Did-- did he use a condom? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: Did you ask him to? Stormy Daniels: No. I honestly didn't say anything. Anderson Cooper: After you had sex, what happened? Stormy Daniels: He said that it was great, he had-- a great evening, and it was nothing like he expected, that I really surprised him, that a lotta people must underestimate me-- that he hoped that I would be willing to see him again and that we would discuss the things we had talked about earlier in the evening. Anderson Cooper: Being on The Apprentice. Stormy Daniels: Right. Daniels says she and Mr. Trump stayed in touch. She says he invited her to a Trump Vodka launch party in California, as well as to his office in Trump Tower in New York. Anderson Cooper: So he definitely wanted to continue to see you. Stormy Daniels: Oh, for sure. Yes. Stormy Daniels: And this was not a secret. He never asked me not to tell anyone. He called several times when I was in front of many people and I would be like, \"Oh my God, he's calling.\" They were like, \"Shut up, the Donald?\" And I'd put him on speakerphone, and he wanted to know what I was up to and, \"When can we get together again? I just wanted to give you a quick update, we had a meeting, it went great. There's-- it's gonna be spectacular, they're totally into the idea,\" and I was like mhmm that part I never believed. Anderson Cooper: Did you still get the sense that he was kind of dangling it in front of you-- Stormy Daniels: Oh, for sure, oh yeah. Anderson Cooper: To keep you interested, to keep you coming back. Stormy Daniels: Of course, of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know? Anderson Cooper: Did you view it as this is a potential opportunity. \"I'm gonna see where it goes?\" Stormy Daniels: \u00a0I thought of it as a business deal. In July 2007 -- a year after they met -- Daniels says Mr. Trump asked to meet with her privately at his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles to discuss a development regarding her possible appearance on Celebrity Apprentice. Stormy Daniels: I remember arriving, and he was watching Shark Week. He made me sit and watch an entire documentary about shark attacks. Anderson Cooper: It wasn't at that point a business meeting, it was just watching Shark Week. Stormy Daniels: Yeah. Anderson Cooper: Did you have sex with him again? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: Did he want to? Stormy Daniels: Yes. Anderson Cooper: How do you know he wanted to? Stormy Daniels: Because he came and sat next to me and, you know, touched my hair, and put his hand on my leg, and r-- referenced back to how great it was the last time. Anderson Cooper: How did you get out of it? Stormy Daniels: Well, I'd been there for, like, four hours. And so I then was like, \"Well, before, you know, can we talk about what's the development?\" And he was like, \"I'm almost there. I'll have an answer for you next week.\" And I was like, \"Okay, cool. Well-- I guess call me next week.\" And I just took my purse and left. According to Daniels, Mr. Trump called her the following month to say he'd not been able to get her a spot on Celebrity Apprentice. She says they never met again and only had sex in that first meeting in 2006. In May 2011, Daniels agreed to tell her story to a sister publication of In Touch magazine for $15,000. Two former employees of the magazine told us the story never ran because after the magazine called Mr. Trump seeking comment, his attorney Michael Cohen threatened to sue. Daniels says she was never paid, and says a few weeks later, she was threatened by a man who approached her in Las Vegas. Stormy Daniels: I was in a parking lot, going to a fitness class with my infant daughter. T-- taking, you know, the seats facing backwards in the backseat, diaper bag, you know, gettin' all the stuff out. And a guy walked up on me and said to me, \"Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.\" And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, \"That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.\" And then he was gone. Anderson Cooper: You took it as a direct threat? Stormy Daniels: Absolutely. Stormy Daniels: I was rattled. I remember going into the workout class. And my hands are shaking so much, I was afraid I was gonna-- drop her. Anderson Cooper: Did you ever see that person again? Stormy Daniels: No. But I-- if I did, I would know it right away. Anderson Cooper: \u00a0You'd be able to-- you'd be able to recognize that person? Stormy Daniels: 100%. Even now, all these years later. If he walked in this door right now, I would instantly know. Anderson Cooper: Did you go to the police? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: Why? Stormy Daniels: Because I was scared. When a gossip website reported a few months later that she'd had an affair with Mr. Trump, Stormy Daniels publically denied it. Five years later, Donald Trump won the Republican nomination for president. Stormy Daniels: Suddenly people are reaching out to me again, offering me money. Large amounts of money. Was I tempted? Yes-- I struggle with it. And then I get the call. \"I think I have the best deal for you.\" Anderson Cooper: From your lawyer? Stormy Daniels: Yeah. The deal was an offer not to tell her story. It came from Mr. Trump's attorney Michael Cohen. In return for signing this non-disclosure agreement, Cohen would pay her $130,000 through a Delaware-based limited liability corporation he had established in mid-October 2016 called essential consultants. Daniels says the agreement was appealing because it meant she would receive some money but also not have to worry about the effect the revelation of the affair would have on her child who was now old enough to watch the news. She signed the agreement eleven days before the election. Anderson Cooper: Was it hush money to stay silent? Stormy Daniels: Yes. The story was coming out again. I was concerned for my family and their safety. Anderson Cooper: I think some people watching this are going to doubt that you entered into this negotiation-- because you feared for your safety. They're gonna think y-- that you saw an opportunity. Stormy Daniels: I think the fact that I didn't even negotiate, I just quickly said yes to this v-- very, you know, strict contract. And what most people will agree with me extremely low number. It's all the proof I need. Anderson Cooper: You feel like if you had wanted to go public, you could have gotten paid a lot of money to go public? Stormy Daniels: Without a doubt. I know for a fact. I believe, without a shadow of a doubt, in my heart, and some people argue that I don't have one of those, but whatever, that I was doing the right thing. I turned down a large payday multiple times because one, I didn't wanna kiss and tell and be labeled all the things that I'm being labeled now. I didn't wanna take away from the legitimate and legal, I'd like to point out, career that I've worked very hard to establish. And most importantly, I did not want my family and my child exposed to all the things that she's being exposed to right now. Because everything that I was afraid of coming out has come out anyway, and guess what? I don't have a million dollars. (LAUGH) You didn't even buy me breakfast. 15 months after she signed the non-disclosure agreement, in January 2018, the Wall Street Journal published this story, quoting anonymous sources, saying that Mr. Trump's attorney Michael Cohen had paid her for her silence. Daniels says she was not the source of the story. But once it was published, she says she was pressured by her former attorney and former business manager to sign statements that Michael Cohen released publicly, denying she'd had an affair with Mr. Trump. Anderson Cooper: So you signed and released-- a statement that said I am not denying this affair because I was paid in hush money I'm denying it because it never happened. That's a lie? Stormy Daniels: Yes. Anderson Cooper: \u00a0If it was untruthful, why did you sign it? Stormy Daniels: Because they made it sound like I had no choice. Anderson Cooper: I mean, no one was putting a gun to your head? Stormy Daniels: Not physical violence, no. Anderson Cooper: You thought that there would be some sort of legal repercussion if you didn't sign it? Stormy Daniels: Correct. As a matter of fact, the exact sentence used was, \"They can make your life hell in many different ways.\" Anderson Cooper: They being\u2026 Stormy Daniels: I'm not exactly sure who they were. I believe it to be Michael Cohen. President Trump's attorney Michael Cohen has denied ever threatening Stormy Daniels. The payment Cohen made to her is now the subject of complaints to the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission, alleging that it was an illegal campaign contribution. What makes the dispute between Stormy Daniels and the president more than a high-profile tabloid scandal is that her silence was purchased eleven days before the presidential election, which may run afoul of campaign finance laws. The president's long-time lawyer Michael Cohen says he used $130,000 of his own money to pay Stormy Daniels. Cohen has said the money was not a campaign contribution. But Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission appointed by President George H.W. Bush, told us he doesn't agree. Trevor Potter: The payment of the money just creates an enormous legal mess for, I think, Trump, for Cohen and anyone else who was involved in this in the campaign. Anderson Cooper: Are you saying that can be seen as a contribution to benefit a campaign? Trevor Potter: I am. it's a $130,000 in-kind contribution by Cohen to the Trump campaign, which is about $126,500 above what he's allowed to give. And if he does this on behalf of his client, the candidate, that is a coordinated, illegal, in-kind contribution by Cohen for the purpose of influencing the election, of benefiting the candidate by keeping this secret. The payment Stormy Daniels received is the subject of complaints by watchdog groups to the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission, which Trevor Potter used to be chairman of. He's now president of the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center, which supports the enforcement of campaign finance laws. Anderson Cooper: If the president paid Michael Cohen back, is that an in-kind campaign contribution that the president should've then reported? Trevor Potter: It is. If he was then reimbursed by the president, that doesn't remove the fact that the initial payment violated Cohen's contribution limits. I guess it mitigates it if he's paid back by the candidate because the candidate could have paid for it without limit. Anderson Cooper: What if the president never reimbursed Michael Cohen? Trevor Potter: Then he is still out on the line, having made a illegal in-kind contribution to the campaign. Anderson Cooper: You're saying this is more serious for Michael Cohen if the president did not pay him back? Trevor Potter: Yes. I think that's correct. We wanted to speak with Mr. Trump's attorney Michael Cohen about this, but he did not respond to our calls and written request for comment. Cohen told The New York Times last month he used his own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Stormy Daniels and said, \"Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump Campaign\u2026 reimbursed me for the payment.\" this past week, Cohen told Vanity Fair magazine, \"What I did defensively for my personal client, and my friend, is what attorneys do for their high-profile clients. I would have done it in 2006. I would have done it in 2011. I truly care about him and the family -- more than just as an employee and an attorney.\" Michael Avenatti: It's laughable. It's ludicrous. It's preposterous. Anderson Cooper: Lawyers don't do that, you're saying. You-- you-- Michael Avenatti: Ever. Michael Avenatti is Stormy Daniels' attorney. He's a Los Angeles trial lawyer who is suing the president in a California court, seeking to have Stormy Daniels' non-disclosure agreement -- or \"NDA\" -- declared invalid, in part because the president never signed it on the lines provided for his alias -- \"D.D.,\" David Dennison. Anderson Cooper: Michael Cohen has said, \"Look, this had nothing to do with the election.\" He would've made this agreement months before. Michael Avenatti: So why didn't he? It just slipped his mind? It's just a coincidence that, in the waning days of the campaign, he thought to himself, \"Oh, you know, I know I've been thinkin' about this for years. Perhaps now is a good time to get that NDA executed with Stormy Daniels.\" \u00a0 Avenatti disputes the notion that Cohen was working in a purely personal capacity when he arranged the hush money for Stormy Daniels. He's found documents that show Michael Cohen used his Trump Organization email address in setting up the payment. He also says the non-disclosure agreement Stormy Daniels signed in 2016, when she was represented by a different lawyer, was FedExed to Cohen at his Trump Organization office in Trump Tower in New York. Michael Avenatti: That is a copy of the Federal Express confirmation The cover letter from Daniels' previous attorney also identifies who he thought Michael Cohen was working for. Michael Avenatti: To Mr. Cohen as executive vice president and special counsel to Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization, again-- listing the Fifth Avenue address. This idea that there's a separation now between Mr. Cohen, individually, and the Trump Organization or Mr. Cohen, individually, and Donald Trump, it-- it-- it's nonsense. Anderson Cooper: There are people who argue that this is much ado about nothing, that if this was not a story about, an adult-film actress and the president of the United States, no one would pay attention. Michael Avenatti: This is about the cover-up. This is about the extent that Mr. Cohen and the president have gone to intimidate this woman, to silence her, to threaten her, and to put her under their thumb. It is thuggish behavior from people in power. And it has no place in American democracy. Avenatti points to this recent court filing in which the president's lawyers claim Daniels is already liable for damages \"in excess of $20 million\" for unspecified violations of her non-disclosure agreement. And in that article in Vanity Fair this past week, Michael Cohen said that when he wins damages from Stormy Daniels, \"I might even take an extended vacation on her dime.\" Anderson Cooper: You're saying they're tryin' to intimidate her. Michael Avenatti: There's no question. You threaten someone-- with a $20 million lawsuit, it's a thuggish tactic. It's no different than what happened in the parking lot in Las Vegas. Anderson Cooper: People make threats in lawsuits all the time. People, you know, say, \"You're gonna have to pay a lot of money when you lose this-- this case.\" Michael Avenatti: People don't threaten people with $20 million lawsuits, that they're gonna take their home and take an extended vacation on the money they receive. People don't conduct themselves like this. They don't. And they shouldn't. Anderson Cooper: Stormy Daniels did sign the agreement. She got $130,000. Isn't she welching on a deal? Michael Avenatti: No, she's not welching on a deal, 'cause there never was a deal. Anderson Cooper: But she still took the money. Michael Avenatti: She took the money. But the fact of the matter is Mr. Trump never signed the agreement. He was obligated to sign the agreement in order for the agreement to spring into effect. That's not true, according to Michael Cohen, who has said only his signature was required. What was also required under the non-disclosure agreement was for Stormy Daniels to turn over all \"video images, still images, email messages, and text messages,\" she had regarding Mr. Trump. Anderson Cooper: Did you do that? Stormy Daniels: I can't answer that right now. Anderson Cooper: You don't want to say one way or the other if you have text messages or other items? Stormy Daniels: My attorney has recommended that I don't discuss those things. Anderson Cooper: You seem to be saying that she has some sort of text message, or video, or-- or photographs. Or you could just be bluffing. Michael Avenatti: You should ask some of the other people in my career when they've bet on me bluffing. Anderson Cooper: In college and law school, you did opposition research for Democratic political operative Rahm Emanuel. Some people looking at that would say you're politically motivated. \u00a0 Michael Avenatti: I haven't done anything in politics in over 20 years. Anderson Cooper: But this is not the usual case you take on. You were a former Democratic operative. And you're talking about deposing the president. That sounds political.\" Michael Avenatti: No, it sounds righteous. Anderson Cooper: How so? Michael Avenatti: Because my client is credible. She's tellin' the truth. Trevor Potter, the former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, says the agency's investigations often take a long time and usually result only in monetary penalties. But there is another scenario that could present a problem for the president: special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. In March, the Washington Post reported that the \"special counsel has examined episodes involving Michael Cohen,\" including his efforts to launch a Trump-branded project in Moscow in the fall of 2015 when Mr. Trump was seeking the Republican nomination. Anderson Cooper: Is there any way that special counsel Robert Mueller could investigate the Stormy Daniels payment? Trevor Potter: Yeah that's the wildcard here. Anderson Cooper: As a prosecutor, you wanna get leverage over somebody that you could then use to get them to give you other information on which-- Trevor Potter: Correct. Anderson Cooper: --you're really interested in? Trevor Potter: Correct. That's what special counsel Mueller appears to be doing with Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, who faces multiple charges including tax and bank fraud. Anderson Cooper: Paul Manafort has been charged with crimes that don't have anything to do with Russia in some cases. Trevor Potter: Well, and that certainly preceded the campaign. And so-- clearly, the Justice Department, the deputy attorney general who is ultimately in charge of this, has determined that looking at what Manafort did in other contexts-- is relevant to the investigation. And I think you can say exactly the same thing about Cohen. He was-- involved-- indisputably with Trump Organization activities with Russia and negotiations with the Russians. Mr. Cohen is in the middle of a place that's of great interest to the Special Counsel. Anderson Cooper: Is there any recent precedent for p-- prosecuting somebody for an undisclosed campaign contribution? Trevor Potter: As it happens, there is. There's sort of a pretty spectacular one. Former senator John Edwards was prosecuted, but never convicted, for payments a supporter and his campaign finance chairman made a year before the 2008 election to a woman who'd had Edwards' child. Trevor Potter: I think the Edwards case is not as strong as the facts we have so far in the Trump case. Anderson Cooper: Why do you think the potential case against Cohen or Trump is a stronger case than the Edwards case? Trevor Potter: The timing of it. It wasn't the year before the election. It's right in the middle of the run-up to Election Day. When-- Trump's conduct with women was a prime campaign issue. In fact, it was what everyone was focused on. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders did not respond to our request for comment from the president. But we did receive a letter from Mr. Trump's attorney Charles Harder, who asked that we show on camera and read on air one of the statements Stormy Daniels signed in January, denying reports she'd had an affair with Mr. Trump. It says, in part: \"My involvement with Donald Trump was limited to a few public appearances and nothing more.\" \u00a0 Anderson Cooper: If Stormy Daniels denied the affair in 2011, which you say is a lie, denied the affair in early January 2018, denied the affair in late January of 2018, doesn't that hurt her credibility? I mean, she's lying, she's lying, she's lying. Michael Avenatti: I think there's no question that it calls into question her credibility. I also think that there's no question that when the American people take all of the facts and evidence into consideration, that they are going to conclude that this woman is telling the truth. And Anderson, to the extent that Mr. Cohen and the president have an alternative version of the facts let them come forward and state it unequivocally. Anderson Cooper: But come on. You would not sign statements one, two, three times about something which you knew to be a lie. Michael Avenatti: If the president of the United States' fixer made it clear to me, either directly or indirectly, that I needed to sign it, and I was in the position of Stormy Daniels, I might sign those statements. Stormy Daniels: I felt intimidated and s-- honestly bullied. And I didn't know what to do. And so I signed it. Even though I had repeatedly expressed that I wouldn't break the agreement, but I was not comfortable lying. \u00a0 Anderson Cooper: How do we know you're telling the truth? Stormy Daniels: 'Cause I have no reason to lie. I'm opening myself up for, you know, possible danger and definitely a whole lot of s***. \u00a0\u00a0 Anderson Cooper: But, you know, there is a potential ups-- financial upside maybe somebody will want you to write a book. Maybe, you know, you can go on a bigger tour and make more money-- Stormy Daniels: That's-- Anderson Cooper: --dancing? Stormy Daniels: That's a lot of ifs. I could also get shunned. I mean, I could automatically be alienating half of my fanbase right at this very moment. Anderson Cooper: Jenna Jameson-- another well-known-- adult film actress said recently about you, \"The left looks at her as a whore and just uses her to try to discredit the president. The right looks at her like a treacherous rat. It's a lose-lose. Should've kept her trap shut.\" \u00a0 Stormy Daniels: I think that she has a lotta wisdom in those words. Anderson Cooper: The president watches 60 Minutes, if he's watching tonight, what would you say to him? Stormy Daniels: He knows I'm telling the truth.\u00a0 Produced by Andy Court and Evie Salomon. Anderson Cooper, anchor of CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360,\" has contributed to 60 Minutes since 2006.

            "article_content": "With student debt expected to top $1 trillion this year, no wonder the movement to make college free for students is gaining momentum even though some experts question the programs' effectiveness. And with the coming midterm elections, candidates are adding to the calls for more of these programs. Nearly a dozen Democratic candidates for governor have vowed to enact a free college plan, and it has become an issue in many Congressional campaigns, according to\u00a0Inside Higher Ed. Eight sitting governors have mentioned the programs in their state of the state addresses, though developments vary by state. In New Jersey, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy was forced to scale back his \"free community college\" plan after the legislature wouldn't fund it at the level he sought. Instead, the program will run as a pilot starting next year. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, who's up for reelection, wants to expand to four-year colleges Maryland's Guaranteed Access Program, which made community colleges tuition-free for eligible students. It would be the second state to do so behind New York.\u00a0 Free college programs, however, have their limits. For one thing, tuition makes up only 20 percent of the cost of attending a two-year public college and living off-campus. States like Oklahoma and Louisiana provide aid dollars in excess of tuition directly to students to use for other costs such as room and board and transportation, but many others don't.\u00a0 Nine of the 15 existing free college programs and 10 of the 16 proposed plans kick in only after a student has exhausted other potential funding sources such as Pell Grants, limiting the numbers of students who would potentially benefit from them. \"Clearly, states are faced with difficult choices,\" an Education Trust report said. \"One appeal of free college may be that middle-income families deeply concerned about the cost of college can receive tuition assistance. At the same time, it may be challenging given limited state resources for free college to both cover tuition for all and more than tuition for low-income students.\"\u00a0 Another question concerns the programs' effectiveness, and the answer isn't clear. A Brookings Institution study of a program in Milwaukee in which randomly selected students received $12,000 in college funding found its impact was muted. \"We are continuing to track these effects; however, it seems clear at this point that many of the potential benefits, during and just after high school, did not emerge,\" the think tank said, adding that the program was poorly designed. As the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities noted, state spending on public colleges and universities remains below historic levels. States have made up the funding shortfalls by hiking tuition and cutting instruction, rendering higher education increasingly unaffordable for many middle class families. \"As college becomes more and more unaffordable, low-income students are less likely to attend than their peers, and a growing number of students are forced to rely on student loans to cover the cost of attendance,\" the Education Trust report said.\u00a0 Still, free college plans have plenty of supporters. Investing in students through free tuition will reap dividends for years for the communities where they live since they \"tend to stay, get better jobs and buy homes,\" said Martha Parham, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Community Colleges. Earlier this year, Senator Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, introduced a bill that would cover the \"full cost of attendance\" at college, which builds on a proposal from Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, who made \"free college\" a central plank of his presidential campaign. Three senators who are potential 2020 Democratic contenders -- Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey -- are co-sponsors of the Schatz bill, which would cost $84 billion in the first year, according to Inside Higher Ed.

            "article_content": "Billionaire J.B. Pritzker has won the Democratic primary for Illinois governor, setting up a general election that could be the most expensive governor's race in U.S. history. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, a wealthy private-equity investor, won the Republican nomination Tuesday over the insurgent candidacy of conservative state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton.\u00a0 The race could become most expensive governor's race in history. Pritzker has already poured nearly $70 million of his own money into the race. Rauner has spent more than $50 million from his own funds.  Pritzker on Tuesday defeated five other candidates, including businessman Chris Kennedy and state Sen. Daniel Biss, to win the nomination.\u00a0 \"I am going to beat Bruce Rauner and together we will get Illinois back on the side of working families,\" Priztker told supporters Tuesday night. \"This campaign is about the fight for economic security.\" \u00a0 The Chicago businessman and heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune put roughly $70 million into his campaign, spending heavily on advertising and staffing campaign offices across Illinois.\u00a0 Pritzker's main message: He is best able to beat Gov. Rauner due to his unified support from organized labor, his mainstream Democratic views and his wealth, CBS Chicago reports. For his part, Rauner was locked in a tighter than expected race in his primary. Biss had successfully cast himself as the \"middle class\" candidate. Indeed he featured his modest Evanston ranch home in his TV spots. Given Biss' progressive credentials, he did an admirable job of fundraising, banking more than $3 million. Kennedy self-funded about half of his $3 million insurgent effort. He staked his campaign on the need to change the status quo by blaming Illinois' most powerful politician, House Speaker Mike Madigan, whose 45 years in command is blamed for the state's fiscal woes and out-migration. Meanwhile, Attorney and former Miss America Erika Harold has won the Republican primary for Illinois attorney general.\u00a0 Harold beat out litigation attorney Gary Grasso Tuesday for the nomination. The Urbana lawyer in November will face the winner of the eight-candidate Democratic field.  Harold has GOP establishment backing and has received campaign contributions from Rauner. Despite those connections, she has positioned herself as a \"reform-minded, political outsider\" who wants to offer a bipartisan approach to criminal justice reform and other issues.  She also wants to take on what she sees to be a corrupt political machine run by Speaker of the House Michael Madigan, a Chicago Democrat.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Rep. Joe Crowley, Democrat of New York, that aired Sunday, July 15, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look now: politics at home and the Democrats. New York Congressman Joe Crowley lost his primary race in a stunning upset to a political newcomer last month. He is we're- here with us today to talk about it. Congressman, it's good to have you on the show. REPRESENTATIVE JOE CROWLEY: \u00a0Thank you, Margaret. Great to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were the first House Democrat to lose a primary in 2018. It can't be good to hear that. But can you say- do you think your district was an anomaly or is there a bigger message to Democrats? REP. CROWLEY: I think there are a number of factors that went into this loss and first and foremost let me say it's been a great honor. One of the greatest honors of my life to serve the people of the 14th congressional district. And this is on me. This loss is on me. I had wonderful volunteers, hundreds of them and a great campaign effort. And just sometimes you come up short. I do think and I want to congratulate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on this effective win. Her campaign was a very effective campaign and she deserves this win but I think there are a number of factors. I think the year of the woman, I think that's a fact that's playing into this and I like that for November. I think that's really good for us as a party. I think the timing of the primary itself not being the normal September back into June it really was an isolated primary in many respects. But as I said before I do want to take anything away from- from her win. This is a big win for her and for the future of our country as well and- and you know the loss I- I have to take the responsibility for that I did not do as I preach. You know, I talk about all politics being local. I- I didn't remind folks of my accomplishments. I didn't take what I had done to help people my district, how I help provide the votes to overturn gay marriage and to- to have gay marriage in New York state that we went from two to five in the Senate in New York State to 7 to 0. That was something that I worked with Governor Cuomo on making happen. I didn't talk about helping people in my district. And- and reminding people where I stood. I just took that for granted I think. MARGARET BRENNAN: You talk about some of the bigger sort of themes or takeaways from this, but just about 12 percent of registered Democrats turned out to vote in this primary. That's pretty low. REP. CROWLEY: I think the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So are we over reading it? REP. CROWLEY: Well I think it goes back to again the timing of the primary itself. I think some people may have take it for granted that I've been around for a while and decided they'll get me in November so to speak, but I don't think we really go back and re-litigate that aspect of it. We all play by the same rules. OK. So Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and I play by the same rules. I do think that the turnout was low. I think it's more reflective again of some of the arcane- the arcane nature of New York state election law itself that may be contributing to this factor. MARGARET BRENNAN: The winner here, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as you said 28 years old political newcomer here she's accused the Democratic Party at large of not taking the interests of people of color seriously, not paying much attention to working class communities. Do you think there's fair criticism in that? REP. CROWLEY: I think it's always open to criticism in terms of policy. I think what we need to really steer away from is character assassination. And I think it's what we really to do is take that energy that's been focused in terms of internal bouts and focus that on the Republicans and win seats that Republicans hold today if we really want to make a difference. I think the Democratic caucus is a big tent party. It's reflective just look at our party take a picture of the people who represent the Democrats in the House and Republicans in the house it's night and day literally in terms of the number of minorities that are represented within the Democratic caucus. It's there. And so I do think we need to focus now on winning seats in November and ensuring that Democrats are in control for the sake of our country. Quite frankly I think the greatest threat to us is this president in the White House. MARGARET BRENNAN: If Democrats do take control,\u00a0should Nancy Pelosi stay as leader? REP. CROWLEY: I think that Nancy- when history looks back on Nancy Pelosi they will look at one of the smartest and hardest working speakers and leaders in the history of our country. She's in-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Your loss made some Democrats question this. REP. CROWLEY: --Well look, you know, I do think that that'll be up to the new Congress to decide who the next leader or speaker will- will be. If we win the House back, Nancy will have a very strong case for holding on to the speakership. If not there may be other issues that come to the fore at that point. But it's up to the next Congress- Democratic caucus to decide that fate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman it's good to have you on this show. REP. CROWLEY: Thank you. Can I just say one thing? I love this country. I love it so much and I'm so proud to have represented my constituents. But I am very, very worried about the direction of this country. And I have a lot to be grateful for. It's given me a tremendous experience in life. But we need to win back the House to bring- to recognize this country once again. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I can imagine you'll be working on that, as we go toward the races in November. We'll be back in just a moment with our panel.",

            "article_content": "\"Today we are not really transferring power from one administration to another, or one party to another, we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people,\" President Trump declared in his inauguration address in January 2017. \"Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.\" Arguably, Mr. Trump's populist rhetoric, which defied the D.C. \"elite\" and those who don't understand \"real\" America, won him the presidency with strong support from the heartland and rust belt that turned out for him in large numbers. A new survey from the Pew Research Center puts data behind some of those divisions, revealing how Americans' educational attainment and where they live -- in an urban, suburban or rural environment -- correspond to vastly different political views, economic outlooks, and beliefs in whether people who live elsewhere share their values.\u00a0 The deepening divide between rural and urban America, and between college-educated and non-college-educated America is one recent books like \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and \"Strangers in Their Own Land,\" among others, have attempted to illustrate. Pew, said associate director of research Juliana Horowitz, has studied various issues that appear in the survey before, but decided to undertake this study after talk of a rural-urban divide highlighted in the 2016 presidential election. Much of the data supports things that have been said anecdotally, but they wanted to \"take a broader look,\" she said. The study comes as a smaller and smaller percentage of the population is living in rural areas, and the earnings gap between college-educated Americans and non-college educated Americans appears to only be widening.\u00a0 Perhaps unsurprisingly, Pew's study finds Americans in urban communities are more likely to identify as Democrats, and those in rural communities are more likely to identify as Republicans. Among registered voters in urban areas, 62 percent identify as Democrats, versus 31 percent who identify as Republicans. Democrats also have a slight edge in suburban areas, with 47 percent of registered voters identifying as or leaning towards being Democrats, and 45 percent identifying as Republican or leaning Republican. More voters in suburbs have identified as Democrats in the last couple years, according to Pew \u2014 potentially a bad sign for the GOP ahead of the 2018 midterms. Of those in rural areas, however, 54 percent of registered voters identify as Republican, and 38 percent identify as Democrats. Americans of all community types are more likely to express \"cold\" feelings towards Mr. Trump than warm \u2014 including those in rural communities, although they are still the most receptive. On what Pew described as a \"feelings thermometer,\" rating from 0 (very cold) to 100 (very warm), 40 percent of those in rural communities expressed a warm view of the president, versus 48 percent cold. Of those in suburban communities, only 32 percent express a \"warm\" feeling towards the president, and 59 percent a \"cold\" feeling; and among urban Americans, only 19 percent express a \"warm\" sentiment towards the president, with 70 percent expressing a \"cold\" sentiment towards him, Pew finds.\u00a0 But the report points not just to discrepancies in political party alignment \u2014 perhaps even more importantly, it points to a lack of perceived commonality in values and understanding. Urban, suburban and rural communities also see a values gap, but again, rural residents see the greatest difference between themselves and other community types. Of those in urban areas, 53 percent say those in rural communities don't share their values. Of those in rural communities, 58 percent say those in urban communities don't share their values. Only those in suburban communities are more likely to agree than to disagree that both other community types share their values. Americans of all communities are likely to say they feel misunderstood by those of different community types. But rural residents feel the most misunderstood. Of rural residents, 70 percent say most people who live in different types of communities don't understand the problems they face. Among urban dwellers, 65 percent say they feel misunderstood, and among suburban voters, just a little more than half \u2014 52 percent \u2014 say they feel misunderstood by other types of communities. Horowitz said that after the 2016 election in particular, there was a narrative that rural communities in America felt misunderstood \u2014 but the same can also be said to a large extent of those in cities.\u00a0 \"They are similar in that way \u2014 they're similar in that they're feeling misunderstood and looked down on,\" Horowitz said. The demographics of rural America set it apart as well. Rural America is also aging more rapidly than the rest of the country, and its communities have lost working-age residents while the working-age population of suburban and urban communities has grown. While 18 percent of the population in rural counties is over 65, just 13 percent is in cities, according to Pew. Rural communities are also the least racially diverse, and have fewer immigrants. U.S. urban counties now have more non-white than white residents, with white Americans making up only 44 percent of American urban communities. Rural communities, on the other hand, are still overwhelmingly white \u2014 79 percent, for the years from 2012 to 2016. And while the share of foreign-born residents was on the rise in all communities over that same period, just 4 percent of residents of rural counties are foreign-born, compared to 22 percent of urban and 11 percent of suburban counties.  When it comes to economic and employment prospects, those in rural communities are the least optimistic about the future of jobs in their community, while those in urban areas are the most optimistic, followed by those in suburbs.  The divisions in America aren't just rural, suburban and urban \u2014 in some scenarios, a person's educational attainment has much more to do with their sense of well being than where they live. While a bachelor's degree isn't a perfect indicator of social class, many economists and social scientists view it as the simplest and most reliable indicator. When it comes to how people view their own economic prospects, a college degree has much more to do with Americans' expecation of future success than where they live, even as rural America struggles to offer sufficient jobs for its workforce.  While a college degree has generally always led to more financial success in the U.S., that is more the case now than ever \u2014 and it's leaving those with only some college or less at a greater disadvantage. In 2015, college graduates, on average, earned 56 percent more than their high school graduate peers \u2014 the largest such gap in the Economic Policy Institute's figures dating to 1973.  College-educated Americans across all community types are likely to think they will have enough income in the future, while those with less than a bachelor's degree do not think they will, Pew finds. Of those who say they currently do not have enough financial success to lead the life they want, but have bachelor's degrees, 53 percent in urban environments, 58 percent in suburbs and 53 percent in rural communities think they will have enough in the future. But among those who are not satisfied with their income level and lack a bachelor's degree, only 44 percent of urban dwellers, 46 percent of suburban dwellers, and 34 percent of rural dwellers think they will in the future. Whether or not someone holds a bachelor's degree also relates to their general optimism for the future, more so than what types of community they call home. Among those with bachelor's degrees, 53 percent say they feel optimistic about their life all or most of the time, compared with 53 percent in suburbs and 55 percent in rural areas. But for those who lack a college degree, only 36 percent of those in urban areas, 39 percent in suburbs and 39 percent in rural areas say the same.  Those without a bachelor's degree are also more likely to view crime as a problem in their community, whatever their community type. Concerns about drug addiction in the community are greatest for those without a college degree. Among those with a college degree, 39 percent in urban areas and 39 percent of those in rural areas (and just 27 percent of those in suburban communities) say drug addiction is a major problem in the local community. But those figures are much higher for those without a bachelor's degree. Of that population, 55 percent in urban areas, 39 percent in suburban areas and 47 percent in rural areas say drug addiction is a major problem in their communities.  Pew's latest study seems to beg the question \u2014 can those in different communities, and of different educational attainment, reach a place where they believe others understand them and share their values?\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to the revolution. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: Across the nation and around the world, thousands and thousands more came out to voice their support for tougher gun laws. But will Washington lawmakers get the message? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Vote them out. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: Last week, Congress enacted some new school safety measures and made modest changes to the background check system for gun purchases. Is this all they can get done in an election year? And it was another head-turning week at the White House. On Friday, President Trump first tweeted out a threat to veto a massive spending package, then changed course and signed it just four hours later, saying he wanted to protect military spending increases. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: The president's disagreements with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster led to his ouster. He will be replaced by Bush administration hard-liner Ambassador John Bolton. Presidential attorney John Dowd is also out. Mr. Trump says he'd like to be interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller, but Dowd reportedly didn't want him to. U.S. stocks had their worst week in two years, as concerns about a potential trade war intensified after the president's steel and aluminum tariffs went into effect. And he slapped close to $60 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese imports. The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, will be here. And we will speak with Iowa Republican Joni Ernst about the impact of a trade war on her home state. And the Stoneman Douglas student activists who led that rally in Washington join us. We will also have plenty of political analysis. It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan. Forty days ago, 14 students and three teachers were killed in a shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Yesterday, survivors led a march on Washington. CBS News estimates the crowd topped just over 200,000 supporters. They were joined by protesters in more than 800 cities in what was billed as the March for Our Lives. The goal? Action in Washington and at the state level for tougher gun control measures. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACLYN CORIN, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: Our elected officials have seen American after American dropped from a bullet. And instead of waking up to protect us, they have been hitting the snooze button. But we're here to shake them awake. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: In Washington, appearances were limited to young leaders and victims of gun violence. Nine-year-old Yolanda Renee King echoed the inspiring speech her grandfather delivered in Washington almost 54 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOLANDA RENEE KING, GRANDDAUGHTER OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: I have a dream that enough is enough... (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) KING: ... and that this should be a gun-free world, period. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: In Atlanta, another hero of the civil rights movement weighed in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOHN LEWIS (D), GEORGIA: We're never too young, we're never too old to march! (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: We begin today with Virginia Senator Mark Warner. He's the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. He joins us here. Senator, a lot to talk to you about, but I want to speak first about this march on Washington that we saw. The march is over. Congress is on break. You did see tucked into that spending bill this week some tightening of background checks with Fix NICS and some funding for school safety. Is this all we're going to see before November? SEN. MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA: I hope not. And there was finally some incremental movement. But in this era of fake news and disinformation, to see the genuineness of all those young people, I think, this time, it's going to be different. I think their demand for sensible gun control, I think we can actually get it done. And I just hope that they will keep that energy alive and moving forward. It was -- I really think it was democracy in action, not just in Washington, but all across the country, yesterday. BRENNAN: In terms of what can be done, you were one of 16 Democrats who voted against an assault weapons ban in 2013. Then, in 2014, you voted against a cap on high-capacity magazines. They're asking now to restrict those things. Have you changed your position? WARNER: I think it's time to change our positions and reexamine. I had always been in favor of universal background checks, particularly after Sandy Hook, but I think it's time for us to have a legitimate debate about restrictions on gun magazines and assault weapons. You get into definitions, but the basic notion of these weaponized, militarized weapons need to be off our streets. And even the Trump administration took some small step this weekend on bump stocks. So, I think it's time. And I hope these kids continue to press. BRENNAN: What would you recommend to them in terms of where they focus their energy now? WARNER: Well, I think the fact that they're going to call for a walkout in April is appropriate. and I think the most important thing they can do, register and vote. End of the day, that's the way you change democracy. BRENNAN: You have about seven months to go until these congressional elections. You and Homeland Security have been looking into election meddling. And they found that Russian agents targeted voting systems in 21 states ahead of the 2016 election. How do you stop that from happening seven months from now? WARNER: Well, we are behind. And it was remarkable that it took Department of Homeland Security this much time to identify those 21 states. And the thing that bothers me the most... BRENNAN: Or to publicly disclose them, or to disclose them to your committee. (CROSSTALK) WARNER: Even -- they took them eight months to even tell the actual states. They had this ridiculous excuse that the top election official would not have appropriate security clearances. And what I think is an embarrassment and a bit disgraceful is that this president still has not called out election security, has not told his top law enforcement and top intelligence agents to make this a priority. He clearly didn't raise it on his call with Vladimir Putin, where he instead congratulated what John McCain called a dictator in a sham election. So, our committee, bipartisan, people like Martin Heinrich and Kamala Harris, Susan Collins, James Lankford, we came up with legislation that said, let's make sure there's that paper trail after every paper ballot, paper trail after every vote. Let's make sure there's better sharing of information. And in the spending bill, there was about $386 million to help states get their act together, because we're already in primary seasons. BRENNAN: Will that make a difference in November? WARNER: It will make a difference, but it will make a -- even more of a difference if this White House would actually realize this is a national security concern, and what the Russians did in the 2016 elections in terms of sowing dissension, weaponizing information has not stopped and, in many ways, has continued unabetted since that time. BRENNAN: This week, Facebook revealed that a Russian propaganda group created about 500 fake accounts, running ads around the election, and spent about $100,000 on divisive acts. Can you possibly legislate a fix to prevent that kind of thing from happening again? WARNER: Well, first of all, Facebook, unfortunately, and all the social media companies, were really slow to respond. I called this out in December of 2016. And, at first, they kind of blew me off and others off who are raising these issues. BRENNAN: Mark Zuckerberg is apologizing in today's \"New York Times.\" WARNER: Well, and the truth is, it's not just the paid ads. That's a small piece. It's the fake accounts that literally touched close to 145 million Americans. And that's just with fake accounts. The next wave of technology will be able to have your image with words coming out of your mouth that may not be said or your face put on somebody else's body in terms of next wave of technology. So, we have to get our arms around this. And I think Mr. Zuckerberg needs to come and testify before Congress, not just put an advertisement in his paper. He said he would if he was the right guy. He is the right guy. He can't send a staff. When I'm called upon on an issue, it's my name on the door. I mean, you wouldn't take a staff member on your show representing me. He needs to come, testify before Congress and explain how they're going to work with us to both protect privacy through 50 million Facebook accounts that were used by this sketchy firm Cambridge Analytica, and how we're going to make sure it doesn't happen again in terms of weaponization of these social media platforms. BRENNAN: And, with Cambridge Analytica, what you're talking about there is this firm that sort of scraped some of this data that people didn't know their personal information was going to be used or manipulated in the process. Steve Bannon, former White House strategist, also served at one time on the board, I believe, at Cambridge. He says he knew nothing about the Facebook mining. Is that a credible denial to you? WARNER: I would like to -- I would love to have that kind of interview with Steve Bannon. I'm not sure... BRENNAN: Do you plan to? WARNER: We hope to. Yes, we do. And what we know about Cambridge Analytica... (CROSSTALK) BRENNAN: Specifically on the Cambridge Analytica issue? WARNER: Well, we raised the question of microtargeting and Cambridge Analytica as early as March of '17. There's something a little fishy about this firm. And we now know that the CEO reached out to Julian Assange, the famous WikiLeaks leader, about hacked e-mails. We know that this company worked with -- reported to work with a Russian oil company who was looking about election data in America. The big question is, Cambridge Analytica, who bragged about how much they helped the Trump campaign microtarget, were they just helping the Trump campaign? Were they utilizing some of the Russian misinformation and disinformation? There are legitimate questions that need to be answered, again, a reason why our investigation needs to continue and why the Mueller investigation needs to continue. BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for your time. WARNER: Thank you. BRENNAN: We want to turn now to Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst. She joins us this morning from Omaha, Nebraska. Senator, good morning. I want to ask you about impact of those tariffs on your home state. SEN. JONI ERNST (R), IOWA: Good morning. BRENNAN: But, first off, I want to ask you, because you are one top 10 recipients of NRA funding in the Senate, your image was being held up by some of those protesters at the rally here in Washington yesterday. I wonder how you are responding to these young activists who are calling for gun control. ERNST: Well, Margaret, I want to push back on that, because I myself don't receive funding from outside organizations, other than what those smaller donations that might come from PACs. Many outside organizations will run advertisements without the consent of candidates. They will run advertisements for candidates, against candidates. I have no control over that. My campaign has no control over that. But I will... (CROSSTALK) BRENNAN: So, you're separating yourself from the NRA by saying that? ERNST: I am -- no, I am not separating myself from the NRA. I would state that there are lot of outside organizations that cannot coordinate with candidates or their campaign. That's against election law. So they will do what they want to do. But I will say that I am a supporter of the Constitution. I'm a supporter of our Bill of Rights. We have many rights that need to be upheld in the United States. And I would say that I have been a Second Amendment supporter my lifetime. I was a member of the NRA long before the NRA knew of Joni Ernst, private citizen in Iowa. BRENNAN: And your advice to those young activists? ERNST: I would say, I -- I appreciate the fact that they have the right to peacefully protest and inform the government of what they believe is the right path forward. I think every citizen has the right to do that. But every citizen, as long as they are law-abiding, also has the right to exercise their Second Amendment right. So, what we don't want to do as a nation is start stripping rights away from law-abiding citizens. So, I think that the status quo is not OK. And that's where these young demonstrators are -- are speaking out against. And so we do have to find a way forward, but simply stating we need to get rid of other people's rights is not the right way forward. BRENNAN: Senator, U.S. stocks had their worst week in about two years, in part due to these concerns of a trade war. Iowa is a major exporter to China. What will these new tariffs the president announced on China and other countries do to your home state? ERNST: Well, nobody wins in a trade war, Margaret, and especially with the Chinese officials, their media reporting that they will retaliate against American agricultural products, namely pork and soybeans. China has purchased $14 billion worth in 2016 of American soybeans. And roughly 60 percent of our soybean crop does go to China. So, if they start retaliating, we will see significant impact, very detrimental impact, not just in Iowa, but across the Midwest as well. BRENNAN: Now, the White House has not yet detailed exactly what these tariffs on China are going to look like. Are they talking to Republicans like yourself? ERNST: Well, there -- there are talks. And I have spoken on trade issues directly with the president before, and I hope that we can continue those conversations in the future. I know that Congress had the U.S. trade rep, Robert Lighthizer, in front of it the other day. They were asking him questions. And it was concerning that Mr. Lighthizer came back said, yes, it will be painful, basically, for the American farmer, but that's a small price to pay. And I -- I disagree. If we want to close up trade deficits, we need to do it in a smart manner. And let's allow American agricultural to close that gap. Let's open up additional markets, not close them off to agricultural goods. BRENNAN: You also sit on the Armed Services Committee. And late Friday, the president did announce that he was changing his position, but still banning, essentially, transgender people from serving in the military. Do you support that? ERNST: Well, I support allowing those transgenders that can serve, I believe they should serve. We do want to make sure that they meet physical requirements. We can't waive that. That is true across any -- any demographic within our military, making sure that they are physically fit and they meet the mental standard. But I have asked transgenders myself, if you are willing to lay down your life beside mine, I would welcome you into our military. But, again, there are standards that have to be met. And I will support the president and the administration on making sure that standards are met. But if there are transgenders that meet those qualifications, certainly, I would gladly have them serve in our United States military. BRENNAN: Will you ask the White House to change its position? ERNST: Well, I think that the White House has done a very studied analysis of how we have the best-qualified people coming into the military. BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. ERNST: And so I'm happy to have those discussions with the administration, but, again, making sure that those standards are applied fairly across the spectrum of every citizen that wants to join our United States military. BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for joining us this morning. ERNST: Thank you, Margaret. BRENNAN: We will be back in one minute with five of the students who put together the March for Our Lives rally yesterday. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look at the Never Again movement. It began hours after the February 14 shooting in Parkland, Florida. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not here for bread crumbs. We're here for real change. We're here to lead. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They might preach NRA. They might preach G-U-N. But we're reaching R-E-V, register, educate, vote. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: But it was Emma Gonzalez' six minutes and 20 second presentation, the exact time of the gunman's rampage, that brought the crowd to silence, as she stood still, tears streaming down her face, honoring those who were lost. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (BEEPING) EMMA GONZALEZ, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: Since the time that I came out here, it has been six minutes and 20 seconds. The shooter has ceased shooting and will soon abandon his rifle, blend in with the students as they escape and walk free for an hour before arrest. Fight for your lives, before it's someone else's job. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) BRENNAN: Today, we welcome five of those student activists, Jaclyn Corin, Ryan Deitsch, Delaney Tarr, plus Cameron Kasky and Emma Gonzalez. Emma, what was that like watching yourself on tape there? GONZALEZ: That was kind of weird. (LAUGHTER) GONZALEZ: I mean, in the moment, it felt so good to finally say it, because, of course, it's really stressful the whole day. You're waiting and waiting and waiting. And I was the last one. So, it had just been building up, and it felt so good to finally say it. BRENNAN: Cameron, what is the overarching policy goal here? I mean, what are you asking for here in Washington? CAMERON KASKY, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: Well, here in Washington, we're demanding an assault weapons ban. We're demanding the prohibition of sales of high-capacity magazines. And we are demanding universal background checks, which is something you will see from the polls pretty much the entire country is behind. And yet we have seen nothing of it. BRENNAN: Well, you did have a statement from the White House yesterday, where the president said he appreciated you all celebrating your First Amendment right, and pointed that his administration banned bump stocks, they enacted the Stop School Violence Act, which authorized grants to increase school safety, and some actions to improve background checks records. Do all of you consider that progress? CORIN: You know, the Stop School Violence Act doesn't even mention the word gun once. Obviously, school safety is important, but it doesn't just happen in schools. And people need to understand that it's a public safety issue, not a school safety issue. So, we need to protect -- we need to fight the problem from the core, which is guns. KASKY: You will notice, in all these shootings, not just the ones in schools, in movie theaters, airports, churches, nightclubs, there's no specific mental health issue that you can tie to every single one. The only thing you can tie to every single one is weapons that belong in the hands of soldiers in the hands of citizens who are untrained. BRENNAN: Do you think that the more than 200,000 people who came out yesterday agree with all of the points that you have been asking for here, Delaney? (CROSSTALK) DELANEY TARR, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: Well, I mean, I do believe that even if they -- there is some difference in opinion on some small issues, ultimately, the fact is that all of these people coming to the largest march on Washington, because it is the largest march on Washington, they were there because they support the cause. They support safety. They support our lives and protecting our lives. And that's what matters. Even if there is some small issue that they don't necessarily stand with us on, they stand with us. And that's what matters. RYAN DEITSCH, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: Well, I mean, I can say from firsthand, as I said the line \"We need to arm our teachers,\" I heard booing from the crowd. I heard they were clearly not behind a message like that. And when I turned it around to say that they need to be armed with pens, pencils, paper, and the money they need to support themselves, you could see the crowd regain support, regain -- like, so there were... BRENNAN: Yes, you confused people a little bit on that... (CROSSTALK) DEITSCH: I did confuse a lot of people. But the crowd was very like-minded, because they all were on the same page that they just didn't want to see all these innocent children die. BRENNAN: Now, you all are not just rallying here in Washington. You have also been pushing in your home state of Florida. But Florida did just decide that they're going to allow training of some teachers to be armed. Some districts can opt out. Do you feel like you lost the argument back at home? KASKY: Not at all. As a matter of fact, in Florida, they passed a bill that raised the age to 21, added a three-day waiting period. These are very small steps in the right direction. But I think you will notice, if all teachers are required to be armed, or at least several teachers per building, many teachers will quit. We have -- every single teacher from my school that I have spoken to said that, if there was an armed teacher in their building, trained or not, they would be out of there. Arming teachers only put kids more in danger, and it puts the teachers in more danger. BRENNAN: Were you surprised to see action in your home state before you saw it in Washington? KASKY: Yes. (CROSSTALK) CORIN: Yes, very much so, because Rick Scott is funded by the NRA. And... BRENNAN: Your governor. CORIN: Yes, our governor. And he defied it, in a sense. And the NRA, in turn, sued the state of Florida. So, that's obviously a step in the right direction. He's running for senator. So, that might have been a reason why he did it, to get the popular vote, but it's still a step. BRENNAN: You're cynical. You're political gaming here, huh? You're student class president? Is that right? CORIN: Yes. BRENNAN: When you're looking at this kind of political activism right now, are you inspired that you want to actually become politically involved after you graduate? CORIN: A hundred percent. A hundred percent, yes. BRENNAN: You going to run for office yourself someday? CORIN: Maybe so. I wasn't really politically involved before this, but I have learned so much in a matter of month-and-a-half, that it's intrigued me, poli-sci. Yes. (LAUGHTER) BRENNAN: We're going to take a break in a few seconds, so we don't have much time here. And then we will come back and finish the conversation. But, quickly, can you raise your hand if you're going to be voting in November? Are you eligible to vote? CORIN: My birthday is in October, so I hit the mark. (LAUGHTER) KASKY: I'm not a Russian computer, so I can't vote in the next election, but for the one vote I can't cast, we will have thousands for us. BRENNAN: And do you have congressional candidates who have signed on to your agenda? GONZALEZ: We're not endorsing any political figures. BRENNAN: Are they endorsing your platform? KASKY: We endorse ideas, not people. And... TARR: If they choose to support us, then we -- absolutely, we love that. We want support, but we're not endorsing any particular candidate. BRENNAN: OK. We have to take real quick, short break, but I want all of you to stay with us, and all of you at home as well. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: We have got more with the Stoneman Douglas High School students coming up. And we hope you will join us next week on FACE THE NATION, where we will be talking with two Republicans from South Carolina, Congressman Trey Gowdy and Senator Tim Scott. They have got a new book coming out. It's called \"Unified,\" a word you don't hear much in Washington. That's next Sunday. Back in a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION and more conversation with our students here in Washington. We will take a look at the rest of the news around the White House. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan. We continue our conversation with Stoneman Douglas High School students Jaclyn Corin, Ryan Deitsch and Delaney Tarr, plus Cameron Kasky and Emma Gonzalez. You guys are more than -- than students. You've become activists. You've had this incredible turnout, not just here in Washington, but around the country. Emma, how do you keep this momentum going? EMMA GONZALEZ, STONEMAN DOUGLAS STUDENT: We're going to be pushing for -- just as Ryan was saying, we're going to be revving up for the election. This is not the end. This was just the beginning. We're going to -- over the summer we're going to try to, you know, like go around to colleges and stuff and -- or our communities, reach out to the kids locally all around the country. And we didn't just have support all over the country, we had support all over the world. We had like almost 900 marches yesterday. BRENNAN: What does that feel like? I mean what did you do after the march? Did you go home and watch the news coverage or -- GONZALEZ: We went to the -- we went -- we went to eat some food. I mean we had a nice hang out at the hotel, which is why my voice is so hoarse because I was screaming like the whole night. CAMERON KASKY, STONEMAN DOUGLAS STUDENT: We, you know, moving forward, it's all about registering to vote, educating others and starting more of conversation so more people get politically involved because, again, the youth of America needs to step up and start voting. You'll see the statistics. It's an embarrassing turnout. One in five people in the last election showed up in the 18 to, was it 29, demographic? And we -- BRENNAN: And you think -- for you all at this table, you have become single issue voters. You won't back someone or vote for them unless they sign on to the agenda that you've laid out? GONZALEZ: We're not backing anybody in general. And we're not going to be single voters at all. BRENNAN: But when you do get the chance to vote, that is something -- you won't vote for someone who doesn't support what you're asking for? JACLYN CORIN, STONEMAN DOUGLAS STUDENT: Yes. It should be something that is at the forefront of the political conversation. It kills more people a year than leukemia. It's an epidemic that we need to face. BRENNAN: But which it -- specifically someone has to call for a ban on AR-15s for you to vote for them? CORIN: I mean -- RYAN DEITSCH, STONEMAN DOUGLAS STUDENT: Assault weapons. CORIN: I would favor that candidate over another one that -- as long as they support some of our ideals more so than the other person, I would vote for them. DELANEY TARR, STONEMAN DOUGLAS STUDENT: We know that this is an issue of compromise and not necessarily in every state we're going to have a politics who is asking for everything that we're asking for. But we want, more than anything, our voters to make educated votes. We want them to know what it is they're voting on. And that's what we've been pushing, because even if they don't necessarily always agree with us, our country needs to know what they're voting on. We can't have them stand behind when there's issues like this that need to be at the forefront of the conversation. Like Jackie (ph) said, this needs to be a centralized issue in the next election. KASKY: From what you've seen from very recent polls, we were at Fox News this morning. We saw a poll they put out. The American people are starting to not be interested in putting anybody into office who's on the NRA's payroll. BRENNAN: Well, we actually also have a poll ourselves that I wanted to cite to you, the CBS News/Ugov poll shows two-thirds of those surveyed say they need to agree with their candidates for the midterm elections on the issue of gun control. So what we see in November is going to be heavily influenced, they are saying, by where that candidate stands on gun control. That's consistent among Democrats, Republicans and independents. CORIN: As it should be. GONZALEZ: Because this is a non-party issue. This is bipartisan. KASKY: And this is one of the issues at the forefront of our nation right now because as you've seen there have been shooting since the one at Stoneman Douglas. The -- this violence isn't going to end unless we do something concrete. BRENNAN: And yet you didn't see the change that you were asking for immediately. This, for you, is a long term campaign. DEITSCH: Well -- well, it's the -- it's the government, the bureaucracy, and they will continually bog things down. I mean the Stop School Violence Act, if you actually read the whole thing, it doesn't really do much. Most of it is already things that have been done, especially in our school a lot of those were already checked off, but these things still happened. I mean it's just going to continue to happen unless we change something. KASKY: That bill, the silent rhetoric behind it is that since the government will never agree on anything, let's pass something very easy and simple that everyone can get behind. But that's because it doesn't do anything. This -- that bill does nothing to keep the students or people outside of schools outside of the line of fire and we're fighting for people everywhere. BRENNAN: That bill you're talking about, fix NICS, you're talking about -- CORIN: The Stop School Violence Act. KASKY: No, the Stop School Violence Act. This isn't just in schools. We met with people from communities who are frightened to leave their houses because -- and who have woken up to the sound of gunshots very frequently. This is everywhere. This is an epidemic. And the Stop School Violence Act does almost nothing to stop it. It doesn't say the word \"gun\" once. It doesn't say the words \"background checks\" once. And 97 percent of the country in a poll showed that they support universal background checks. Anyone who doesn't, I don't understand that. BRENNAN: All right. Well, all of you, as you say, you're going to continue to work on this. We'll continue to track what you get done. Thank you very much for coming here. CORIN: Thank you for having us. TARR: Thank you. BRENNAN: Congratulations on the rally. I know you're all very excited about that. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: We want to turn now to a student at Stoneman Douglas High School who has an opposing viewpoint in the debate over gun violence. Since the shooting at his school last month, Kyle Kashuv has met with President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, along with top lawmakers in Congress, pushing proposals to improve school safety and voice his support for the Second Amendment. And Kyle Kashuv is here with us today. Kyle, welcome to FACE THE NATION. KYLE KASHUV, STONEMAN DOUGLAS STUDENT: Thank you. BRENNAN: Now, you don't necessarily support the march that just happened, but tell me why you're here in Washington. KASHUV: Well, look, I'm here for one very simple reason, I don't want to see this ever happen again. And what I saw at the march yesterday, which really frustrated me, is that I have a differing point of view, but what really concerned me was that how come I wasn't invited to speak at the march because, as Americans, we all have different points of views and it's important to represent them all equally. BRENNAN: And your point of view is, what, you don't agree with the agenda that they're laying out there in terms of restrictions on assault weapons? KASHUV: Well, yes. I mean I talked to senators and I looked at all the facts and they all point in the same direction, that a ban on assault weapons will not solve this issue. It's simply -- it's simply a -- BRENNAN: And restrictions on high capacity magazines. KASHUV: That won't solve the issue. What we've seen is that there are certain things such as having -- enforcing the regulation that's currently in law. I mean we've seen on so many different levels that the cowards of Broward (ph) failed, the FBI failed, Sheriff Scott Israel failed. So many different multi-layered levels failed in Parkland. And it's absolutely reprehensible that I didn't see one single poster yesterday at the march that said f the NRA that -- no, sorry, that said f Sheriff Scott Israel. BRENNAN: So you are a survivor. You lived through this assault yourself. What do you think would have prevented another student like you from going through something similar? KASHUV: Well, look, I mean, this kid was flagged. He was flagged by the child protective services. He was -- BRENNAN: The shooter. KASHUV: Yes. I don't like to say his name. I prefer not to. He was flagged by the FBI. He was flagged so many different times by the Broward Sheriff's Office. And it's -- we need to see that we have to hold our government accountable, we have to, because this can happen again if our government does not do what it's supposed to do. And I find it ironic that after all this -- and we've seen so many different government failures -- we want to trust the government even more. BRENNAN: Do you have any points of agreement with your classmates? KASHUV: I agree with them completely, that this cannot happen ever again. But I differ with them on what policy needs to be made. BRENNAN: So you've been here in Washington. You actually -- you were welcomed to the White House. The first lady invited you as well. Do you think that you're going to stay politically involved? KASHUV: Well, look, I'm going to do everything that I have to do to make sure this won't ever happen again and to ensure American's safety. BRENNAN: So have you considered -- I mean give me a sense, when you go back to Parkland and you have to go to school and sit in the same classroom with some of these people you're disagreeing with, how many other fellow students support your way of thinking? KASHUV: There -- there's a very -- there's a silent minority at Stoneman Douglas who agrees with me completely. Something called the Marshal Program, which was registered and implemented in Florida and which would allow properly trained officers and veterans, and unemployment veterans, to acquire the training to protect our school because we've seen in Maryland that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. And it really concerned me as to home come we did not see a single person -- BRENNAN: You want -- you would have liked more armed guards at the school? KASHUV: Absolutely. I mean we saw it in Maryland. He stopped the shooter. He did his job. And had the cowards of Broward done their job, I think that the count in Parkland would have been much lower. We saw that in Maryland that a good guy with a gun stopped a bad guy with a gun. The only way to stop an active shooter on campus is to have another person to eliminate him. BRENNAN: So in your meetings with people on Capitol Hill and at the White House, did you get any promises to take action? Did they tell you anything would be done to follow through on what you're laying out? KASHUV: Every single senator that I have spoken with does not want to see this happen. I spoke with Senator Marco Rubio. BRENNAN: Of course. KASHUV: He cares so much about this. And it pains me to see how he's being represented in the media. BRENNAN: But did they promise to do any of the things that you're asking for? KASHUV: They promised to fight tooth and nail to make sure this won't ever happen again. But we have to make sure that the laws that we're enacting don't hurt America on a national scale. And that's why I think that we have to sit down with all members of this issue, OK, sit down with me and David Hogg or Cameron Kasky and debate this and find a common middle ground because that's the only way that we're going to protect the American people. BRENNAN: Kyle, thank you for coming on. KASHUV: Thank you for having me. BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment with our political panel. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: And now some political analysis. Jamelle Bouie is the chief political correspondent at \"Slate\" and a CBS News political analyst. Michael Gerson is a columnist at \"The Washington Post.\" We'd like to welcome to the program Zeke Miller. He's a White House reporter for \"The Associated Press.\" And Anne Gearan is a White House correspondent for \"The Washington Post.\" Lots, as always, to talk about in the week that was. Zeke, we saw some news this morning out of the White House, the president had dismissed his legal counsel, John Dowd, earlier in the week. He said he was going to replace him, but now we're learning the president can't hire the person he wanted. What's going on? ZEKE MILLER, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, we're finding out that the Trump legal team looks a little like the Trump White House to a certain extent where they're just not getting the i's dotted and the t's crossed, where here the Trump legal team is saying that because his new attorneys represent others in that -- in the Russia investigation, that -- that they are conflicted out from working for the president and that -- you know, that's one of those things that they probably should have worked out before they got rid of John Dowd. BRENNAN: So what happened? How did John Dowd get fired before there was actually a new lawyer to replace him? MILLER: Well, it's really not entirely clear, like everything else around the Trump legal team. It is kind of a little slap dash to a certain extent where they're not actually doing all the leg work. And also it's the challenge of working for President Trump where he does make some of those decisions somewhat impulsively and that doesn't always lead to sort of all the follow through and all the background that needs to get -- the legwork that needs to get all those things in place. BRENNAN: Anne, we saw another shakeup at the White House this week. H.R. McMaster, who has been rumored to be departing the White House for some time, actually is now resigning. He's being replaced by John Bolton. What does that signal about what's ahead for foreign policy? ANNE GEARAN, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, I think it signals, buckle up, John Bolton is a very, very skilled tactician. He has been around Washington for decades. He has held some of the most extreme views now represented in the White House in administration's past and in between those administrations. And he has been consistent. I do not expect him to change those views at all. He is an interventionist in the classic sense. He's -- he was the original neoconservative. And he has -- BRENNAN: But the president campaigned saying he didn't support those ideals. GEARAN: Right. He -- the president has said that the Iraq War was one of the biggest blunders of American history, not just foreign policy, history, period. John Bolton was and remains a resolute supporter of the Iraq War. I think it very much remains to be seen how they mesh on policy. Trump appears to like Bolton for his pithy, forthright opinions, often expressed on Fox News. But also just that, you know, he's a -- he's a guy who Trump recognizes. He is very opinionated and very firm in those opinions. And one of the things he didn't like about McMaster is that he thought that McMaster was too cerebral and caveated everything on this hand and that hand. And he didn't like that. JAMELLE BOUIE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I think one thing that's worth noting about President Trump is that during the campaign he did campaign against the Iraq War, but that wasn't necessarily sort of a dovish position. President -- President Trump throughout the campaign in 2016 said that what the United States military should have done is taken the oil. It should have been much more aggressive. It should have -- essentially activism the most imperial power in Iraq. And I think there's a degree to which Bolton -- the Bolton twist reflects this aggressiveness within Trump's political message, even that that -- that was there at the same time that Trump was skeptical of the Iraq War. MICHAEL GERSON, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": I agree with that. I mean he is not a neoconservative. He does not believe in the promotion of democracy -- BRENNAN: The president is not. GERSON: No, no -- no, Bolton is not. BRENNAN: Bolton. GERSON: He is much more in the category of Dick Cheney, a hard powered realist. An interventionist, exactly right, but not with an idealistic bent. So I think it does kind of fit the president in a certain way. But I think sometimes we read a little bit too much into these, too, because I'm not sure that this represents some kind of change in policy. I think it's just equally plausible that the president likes people who play loyalists on television. And that's exactly what he was. And I think that's what attracted the president to him, not to his views on foreign policy. BRENNAN: It's interesting you say you don't necessarily view him as ideological in this sense because there has been this narrative that the president's surrounding himself with people who are more ideological on some of these issues. Certainly on Iran, Bolton has been on the record that he wants to fully pull out of this nuclear deal. He's been on the record urging some military intervention in North Korea as well. GERSON: I think he's deferring to people to defer to him, who are not disagreeing with him. I mean he's punished people that confront him, that bring a different perspective. I don't think it's that Larry Kudlow is a Kempite. That's not the reason that he's there. He's a supply sider. The president is not. He doesn't have any views on that topic as far as I can tell. But he's a loyalist. And I think he's selected out people who have strong views that disagree with him. MILLER: Well, we saw that even just -- all the factions early on in the administration, whether it be the Jared Kushner wing, which has been weakened, the Reince Priebus wing of the Republican establishment that's also been weakened, and the Steve Bannon wing of nationalists have been largely exiled out of this administration, and replace that team of rivals as kind of this squad of cheerleaders of people who have that personal relationship with the president, and that's what he values more than anything else. And I think that's exactly the right way to view both the Kudlow hire and then also this move with Bolton. BOUIE: I don't -- GEARAN (ph): And Kudlow (ph). BOUIE: I don't -- I think we shouldn't understate, though, that Kudlow, Bolton, these are -- they're television personalities as much as they are pundits or operators. And they -- I think there is something to the fact that the president, who does watch a tremendous amount of Fox News, who every morning tweets -- live tweets his Fox News viewing -- BRENNAN: He claims he doesn't watch television very often. BOUIE: He doesn't watch television at all. He's never seen a lick of it. But there's -- there has to be the degree to which this just does reflect the president's comfort with these television personalities. That he likes what they say on TV. That's why he wants them in his White House. BRENNAN: Well, fitting that idea is Larry Kudlow, who's on his economic team now replacing Gary Cohn, rejects the idea of tariffs. And the president doubled down this week on the tariff, not just on steel and aluminum, but put them on China. How do -- how do you make sense of that, Michael? I mean did this start a trade war? GERSON: I don't think you -- I don't think you do make logical sense of it. I mean this is a president where -- he's not just surrounded by chaos. I think chaos is internal. He doesn't have consistent views on a number of things. Tariffs may be actually an exception. This is one issue that he has talked about for quite a while. But it certainly doesn't influence his personnel choices in this case. So I -- you know, I think we do over interpret these things. BRENNAN: Anne, do you think that putting these tariffs on China, even though they're not detailed yet, complicates the rest of the diplomacy with North Korea because we need China's help? GEARAN: For sure. I mean it -- this is something that Trump talked about aversion of this on the campaign and people expected to see early on in the administration the fact that he didn't move on it quickly was seen as, oh, he's actually serious about trying to do something about North Korea, and then they did it. They spent a year applying very strict sanctions with China's cooperation and help at the United Nations. And Trump would occasionally, you know, smack Xi Jinping around a little bit saying, oh, he's not doing enough. But then, almost in the same breath, he would say, but he's a good guy, he's trying, he's trying to do something. And it -- Trump really does appear to understand that a key to any solution with North Korea, it goes through China. And so why he's doing this now is a mystery to me. And it absolutely complicates things. We have not heard China say at this point that they will no longer cooperate or really make any definitive statements about North Korea at all. But clearly it's a card they now have to play. BRENNAN: Zeke, what happened on Friday? The president came out and tweeted he was going to veto this $1.3 trillion spending package that he had been persuaded and the White House had said he was going to sign off on and then four hours later he changes his mind again. MILLER: Well, I mean, he'd been pretty clear that he did not like this legislation. Paul Ryan had to go over to the White House and sort of convince him earlier in the week to sort of get behind it. But he was watching television news. It all comes back to similar -- he was watching Fox News give the criticism from traditional conservatives over big spending legislation. This was big spending legislation that Republicans ran against and talked a lot about certainly in the Obama years, and that this is one the president was going to have to sit down and sign. So it was the $1.3 billion -- trillion price tag was also some of the other little sweeteners that Democrats got as an inducement to get their votes. All of those things got the president kind of riled up that morning. And it's not clear what he thought he was going to get. It wasn't a negotiating position. Congress was out of town. But it just -- it was a -- it was a little bit of venting and frustration. BOUIE: It was striking to watch their -- what that venting happen on Twitter because it's just a remarkable statement of presidential weakness. This is a Republican president, with a Republican Congress, and this is a Republican crafted spending bill fundamentally. And the president has gone on his main platform to say, I will -- I hate this -- I hate this bill. I'm not going to let it happen again. Which races the question, how did it happen in the first place? And I think that reflects the extent to which President Trump is not a particularly engaged president with Congress, does not have the kind of strength of relationships that would get him to work his will though Congress. And I'm just kind of shocked that he would express this and like let the world know that this is the case. But I suppose that is how President Trump does things. GERSON: He images himself a great negotiator, but this is a losers bluff. BOUIE: Right. GERSON: This is something that -- you know, not a good negotiating approach. BRENNAN: To say you're going to do something and then not do it. GERSON: Right. Exactly. And he wants high stakes negotiations with the North Koreans, with the Chinese on tariffs. But it's really kind of a self-confidence without accomplishment. I don't see him as particularly good in negotiations, particularly with the Congress, but in other areas. So I think he images himself the great negotiator, but I'm not sure that reality shows it. BRENNAN: Michael, I want to ask you about another TV moment yet to come on \"60 Minutes\" on this network tonight. Stormy Daniels is going to tell her story. This week we also heard from a Playboy playmate who claims to have had this past affair with Donald Trump before he was president. Are these stories credible and do they matter? GERSON: Well, it's actually an extraordinary cultural moment that a porn star is more credible than the president of the United States when it comes to these matters. I don't think it's even close. I would take her word over his on any of these matters. This is a case where the president has been caught in a certain approach, which is, he plays it close to the line, violates rules, he does unethical things and then he buys the silence of others, he buys legal threats, he encourages non-disclosure agreements, trying to cover what he does. And she has called him on this. This is -- and I think it's an amazing cultural moment. BRENNAN: A cultural moment. Does it have a political cost? BOUIE: I think it does. One thing that's striking about the Stormy Daniels controversy, scandal -- BRENNAN: I know, we don't even know what to call it really. BOUIE: I don't -- Daniels-gate? I don't know. Is that she's been able to keep it in the news. Like, unlike so much -- BRENNAN: Well, that's part of the legal strategy, it would appear. BOUIE: Right. Right. So much -- unlike so much of the controversy around President Trump, she and her lawyers have been able to make this a continuing story. And that, for me, is why I think this might actually have some political consequences for him down the road because it -- it is putting him in a bind. It's putting him and his team in a bind. They have to do something to address it without kind of confirming it. And that is something -- that's a -- that's a line they haven't been able to -- GERSON: And he's been silent on this, which is extraordinary. BOUIE: Right. BRENNAN: Very quickly, Anne, are we going to see the White House expel Russian diplomats, as they're indicating? GEARAN: It's certainly something that the White House is considering and Trump appears to be ready to go along with it. As we've discussed here, he changes his mind a lot. But a minimum of 20 is what's on the table according to people I've talked to in the last couple of days. And this would be in solidarity with Britain. BRENNAN: We'll watch and see. Thank you very much to all of you. We'll be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan",

            "article_content": "When he passed away, the 41st president of the United States, George Herbert Walker Bush, was 94. His one term in office began in 1989, and coincided with the end of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. You're about to hear from three former presidents, a rare occurrence in and of itself, discuss the life and legacy of George H.W. Bush. In recent interviews, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush all acknowledged number 41 was one of the best-prepared presidents in American history. Before becoming commander in chief, he was a fighter pilot, an oilman, a congressman, a diplomat, head of the CIA, and Ronald Reagan's vice president for two terms. He was also married to Barbara Bush for 73 years, until her death this past April. Together they had six children. \u00a0 We begin tonight with their eldest son, President George W. Bush, and what his father taught him about the highest office in the land. Former President George W. Bush: The mission was not George H. W. Bush, the mission was: how do we serve the United States? How do we help the United States? How do we make the United States better? Which is very important in establishing a culture that can succeed. Norah O'Donnell: That the office was more important than the man. Former President George W. Bush: The office is more important than the man. It's really one of the most important things for Americans to understand. Dad taught me this. And therefore, one of the jobs is to strengthen the institution of the presidency, bring honor to the office. And that clearly George H. W. Bush did. Norah O'Donnell: And bringing honor to the office, that institution, why is that so important? Former President George W. Bush: The institution of the presidency is a shock absorber. Look, every president has got strengths and weaknesses, we just wanna make sure that the country, the ballast of the ship estate, you know, is strong enough to withstand either tumultuous times or, you know, the foibles of mankind. Norah O'Donnell: You said that watching his presidency and the criticism that he got as president-- Former President George W. Bush: Yeah. Norah O'Donnell: --helped you. Former President George W. Bush: Yeah, it did. Because, first of all, being a child of a president is unpleasant. I mean, you watch somebody you love get lampooned, or made fun of, or harshly criticized. It hurts. And so by the time I became president, you know, I had to-- a fair amount of asbestos (LAUGHTER) on my skin. And it didn't hurt nearly as much, it turns out. You know? Norah O'Donnell: It was like fire retardant? Former President George W. Bush: Exactly. Fire retardant. (LAUGHTER) Norah O'Donnell: Did it bother your father to see you criticized while you were in office-- Former President George W. Bush: Yeah. (LAUGH) It did. \u00a0in the end, though, you know, we both knew that's part of the job, I mean, which is actually good, you know, for the country. I mean, you want your powerful people to be held up to scrutiny. Norah O'Donnell: When you look back at your father's term in office as president-- Former President George W. Bush: \u00a0Yeah. Norah O'Donnell: \u00a0--he starts, to many people, look better and better. Former President George W. Bush: (LAUGH) Yeah, we all do. (LAUGHTER) That's the way time works. I think he's gonna go down as the greatest one-term president ever. Because of his foreign policy, deftly handling the end of the Cold War, for example, reunification of Germany. When the Soviet Union collapsed, like so many times in his career, President Bush turned for help to his longtime trusted friend James Baker. George Bush chose James Baker for his secretary of state before naming anyone else to his cabinet. The two first met three decades earlier when Baker was just a Texas lawyer and a tennis player looking for a game. James Baker: neither one of us had a partner for the doubles matches. And so they put us together. And that's how we became friends. We first became (LAUGH) tennis doubles partners. Together, they dealt with the fall of the United States' old Cold War rival. They also faced new turmoil in the Middle East and a war followed. In 1990, the U.S. built a coalition of 33 nations to push Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi army out of Kuwait. Perhaps no president and secretary of state had known each other so well since James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. James Baker: And I was secretary of state for a president who was all-- who was like a brother. And there was never any question about wh-- if I went out and said something, no doubt about whether I was speaking for the president or not. Twenty-five years later, James Baker told us that his friend's four-year term in office was one of the most consequential in history. James Baker: I mean look at what happened on his watch. The world changed. And we had a peaceful resolution of the Cold War. It didn't have to end peacefully. It could have ended with a bang, and not a whimper. George Bush was the one who made sure that it ended that way, and took a lot of heat, by the way, from the press, for not dancing on the ruins of the wall when the Berlin Wall came down. James Baker: And notwithstanding all the pressure on him to stick it in Gorbachev's eye once the wall came down. He said, \"No. We got a lot of business still to do with Gorbachev. We're not going to do that.\" And it was the right thing to do it. And that, as much as anything else in my view, cemented the possibility of a peaceful end of the Cold War, as opposed to a cataclysmic end to the Cold War. Former President Barack Obama: I think more than anything you learn from when you look at your predecessors is-- what are the actions they took that you admire? What are the mistakes they made that you want to avoid? They tend to be, in some ways, speaking to you through their own record continuously. Former President Barack Obama awarded George H.W. Bush the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 and says he especially admired his foreign policy. Former President Barack Obama: What people don't appreciate fully, even within his own party, is the degree to which he had to land the plane when the Berlin Wall comes down. Former President Barack Obama: You have chaos potentially in the former Soviet Union and Russia. And uncertainty in Europe. All those things could have gone haywire at any point. And-- the-- the restraint, the caution, the lack of spiking the football that they showed was I think an enormous achievement. Norah O'Donnell: The author of a new book about your father and the end of the Cold War, his name's Jeffrey Engel, wrote, \"Bush, as much as anyone else, and certainly more than any other foreigner, can lay claim to being the father of modern Germany.\" Former President George W. Bush: Yeah. I think the Germans would tell you that. My friend Angela Merkel certainly told me that. And-- and the reason why is because he quietly worked to unify Germany without calling attention to himself. Europeans were very nervous about a unified Germany. Norah O'Donnell: There was a young KGB officer at the time (LAUGH) in Berlin. Former President George W. Bush: Yes, he was. Norah O'Donnell: You know who I'm talkin' about-- Former President George W. Bush: Yeah, I do. Norah O'Donnell: Vladimir Putin. Former President George W. Bush: Yeah. Norah O'Donnell: He wasn't happy about the end of the Cold War. Former President George W. Bush: No, he wasn't. Still isn't. And-- so-- Norah O'Donnell: Yeah. Former President George W. Bush: Here's-- here's a George Bush story. I learned-- one of the things I learned from him was to, you know, give these world leaders kinda special treatment if possible. Former President George W. Bush: And I said, \"Dad, I need a place to bring Vladimir Putin. Would you mind if I brought him to Kennebunkport,\" knowing full well that Putin would say, \"Wow, this is really great.\" And he said, \"Not at all.\" And he-- so Putin lands. Former President George W. Bush: And there's Dad at the foot of the stairs to greet him. As president, the elder Bush was known as a master of \"personal diplomacy\" and almost 15 years out of office, at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, he still had the knack. Former President George W. Bush: So he said, \"You wanna go out on our boat?\" Former President George W. Bush: And-- Putin said, \"Oh, I'd love to go.\" And so Putin has this interpreter (LAUGH) that's kind of-- you know-- didn't look like much of an outdoorsman. (LAUGH) And the old man opens that thing up full blast and this guy, I'm standing to this interpreter, he's like white knuckles, you know, hanging on to the boat wondering if he's going to live. And he's cutting through these waves, it's just classic George Bush. Norah O'Donnell: What was Putin doing? Former President George W. Bush: He loved it. You know, Putin's kind of one of these macho dudes that-- salt spray comin' across, you know, and he thought it was wonderful. It's the interpreter was (LAUGH) nerve-wracked. (LAUGHTER) George H.W. Bush also shared light-hearted moments with two other men who came after him as president. Former President Barack Obama: he was a good reminder that as fiercely as we may fight on policy and on issues, that ultimately we're Americans first. And that kind of attitude is something that I think a lot of people miss. Former President Bill Clinton: I think that history will be quite kind to him in his presidency. Former President Bill Clinton says he learned a lot about the character of the man he replaced from a letter. \u00a0 He read us the note George Bush left him in the Oval Office in 1993. Former President Bill Clinton: \"Dear Bill, when I walked into this office just now I felt the same sense of wonder and respect I felt four years ago. I know you will feel that, too. I wish you great happiness here. I never felt the loneliness some presidents have described. There will be very tough times, made even more difficult by criticism you may not think is fair. \"I'm not a very good one to give advice, but just don't let the critics discourage you or push you off course. You will be our president when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success now is our country's success. I'm rooting hard for you. Good luck.\" Former President Bill Clinton: This letter is a statement of who he is. That's why he's a world-class human being in my book Former President George W. Bush: Bill Clinton was smart about how he dealt with my dad. He treated him with great respect. And dad is a big enough man to, you know, want to befriend Bill. And they've become friends. And-- and-- it's-- it's neat to see. Former President Bill Clinton: And our friendship just got better. And in a world where everybody's just guttin' each other all the time I thought it was a good thing to show. Former President Bill Clinton: It's been one of the great joys of my life, my friendship with him. our arguments were good-natured and open, and we continue to debate things all the way up until recently. Their later-in-life friendship was unlikely given the hard-fought presidential campaign of 1992. President Bush's hopes of a second-term ended when Bill Clinton won the presidency with 43 percent of the vote. Texas billionaire Ross Perot, an independent, took 19 percent. Mr. Bush captured only 37 and went back home to Houston. It was a painful loss. We asked George W. Bush about what went wrong. Former President George W. Bush: He said, \"Read my lips, no new taxes,\" and-- which was-- a strong pledge, and then raised taxes for what he thought was good of the country. But, you know, it-- it's a clear lesson of consequences He gave that now infamous pledge at the 1988 Republican Convention in New Orleans. George H.W. Bush at Convention: The Congress will push me to raise taxes and I'll say no, and they'll push and I'll say no, and they'll push again and I'll say, to them, \"Read my lips, no new taxes.\" \u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: Was that one of his biggest mistakes? Former President George W. Bush: I think it-- politically it was for sure. Policy-wise, people had argued it wasn't. But yeah, politically-- Norah O'Donnell: Because he ended up raising taxes and it led to a balanced budget over time. Former President George W. Bush: Correct. Norah O'Donnell: You think that played a big role in his defeat in '92? Former President George W. Bush: I think it played a big role in-- in-- in fracturing the Republican party. I don't think it played a role in the general election so much. But in order to win you have to have a solid base. And if your base is fractured, it's gonna-- it's really hard to win in American politics. And it fractured his base in the Republican party. Norah O'Donnell: But that was an example, too, where he chose to do the right thing over what was the politically expedient thing, or what he may have said at the time. Former President George W. Bush: No, that's right. No, I'm-- I'm not arguing if you're right or wrong, I'm just saying politically it was-- it was harmful. Norah O'Donnell: Yeah. Former President George W. Bush: Policy-wise, you know, a lot of people would argue it helped the country. Former President Barack Obama: All that talk about trying to reduce the deficit required tough choices. It wasn't as if there weren't some serious cuts made as well. He did not enjoy the-- the fruits of his labor. By the time that people saw the benefits of reducing deficits and lower interest rates he had already-- he had already lost. Former President George W. Bush: He was able to absorb loss. Of course, the most stinging one was 1992. Norah O'Donnell: But the point you make, he had a lot of losses. Former President George W. Bush: Yes, he did. (LAUGH) Yeah, and bounced back which, you know-- and I think that's an important lesson in life, that you're gonna have losses in life. And the question is: how do you deal with them? George Herbert Walker Bush's life spanned the most important geopolitical events of the 20th century. On his 18th birthday, he enlisted in the Navy and became one of the youngest American fighter pilots in World War II. Fifty years later, as commander in chief, he helped secure a peaceful end to the Cold War. In retirement, he decided it would be fun to jump out of airplanes and sky dive until he was 90. But it was more than his achievements and his hobbies that made the man and the president unique. In historical terms, he was the last of his kind. Jon Meacham: I think we have to really think about this, because George Herbert Walker Bush was the last president of the World War II generation. from Roosevelt to Truman to Eisenhower to Kennedy to Nixon to Ford to Carter to Reagan, they had all been shaped by the Depression and the war. Historian Jon Meacham spent about a decade interviewing President Bush for his biography of the 41st president. Jon Meacham: To me, his story begins on his 18th birthday. Three things happened. He turned 18. He graduated from Andover. And he drove to Boston and took an oath as a Naval enlistee. Went to flight school. Became what we believe to be the youngest flying officer in the Navy. Former President George W. Bush: U.S. gets attacked and he makes up his mind that he wants to serve his country, even though his dad, who he loved dearly, suggested he go to college first. Norah O'Donnell: Where did he get that sense of duty, honor, country? Former President George W. Bush: I think his father. His dad was in World War I. Pretty confident that's where he got it. Norah O'Donnell: I read the only time he saw his own father cry was when he left. Former President George W. Bush: Yeah, at the train station. That's right. Turned 18 years old and right after his 18th birthday goes in and his dad wept. He flew a total of 58 combat missions in the Pacific. September 2nd, 1944 was nearly his last, when Lieutenant Bush and his two crewmates were shot out of the sky by the Japanese. Jon Meacham: The plane is hit. The wings go up in flames. The cockpit fills with smoke, but he keeps going. He takes out the tower, he goes back out. He realizes he's about to go down. He tells his two crewmates to hit the silk to get out, and then he bails out. He gashes his head on the tail of the plane, plunges into the sea. Comes up. He's retching seawater. And he realizes that his two crewmates have not made it. Jon Meacham: And to some extent, I think that every day since that Saturday in the Pacific, he's been trying to justify that he was spared when other men were fated to die. Four hours after his plane went down, Bush was plucked from the Pacific by the crew of the U.S.S. Finback. \u00a0\u00a0 An officer on board the submarine captured the rescue on 8mm film. Former President George W. Bush: One time I said, \"Dad, do you ever think about the war?\" This was late, much later. He said, \"I think about Delaney and White all the time.\" Norah O'Donnell: His two crew members. Former President George W. Bush: Yeah\u2026 By the way, he wasn't the only guy, of course, who went through that experience. I mean-- it kinda defined a generation, World War II did. And-- but it-- it-- I think it enabled him to be a, you know, a strong leader After the war, Bush went to Yale University, where he was a member of the Skull and Bones secret society and played first base on the baseball team. Former President George W. Bush: He was captain of a great baseball team. And a bunch of these World War II guys came back to Yale and they were in the NCAA finals twice. Norah O'Donnell: Could he have played in the majors? Former President George W. Bush: No. Good fielder, just couldn't hit. If you can't hit, you go-- don't go to the majors. But he did graduate Phi Beta Kappa in just two and a half years. By then he had married Barbara Pierce who became his partner in life and politics. \u00a0 Barbara Bush from archives: My job is to go out and talk about George Bush the man and this well-qualified person and I like doing it. Nobody asked me to do it. That's what I do. I don't give advice. I don't take it very well either I might add. When she died this past April, Barbara Bush had been married to George Bush for 73 of her 92 years. It was the longest marriage between a president and first lady in American history. Former President Bill Clinton: They probably both would hasten to say that the-- their lives-- they both did more than they would have, either one of them, if they hadn't been together. I mean, they're-- \u00a0remarkable, amazing partnership. Former President George W. Bush: This is a guy who ca-- by the way, who goes to Yale, is kind of the star at Yale, baseball captain, Phi Beta Kappa, and was expected to go to Wall Street and he decides to move to Odessa, Texas. And he goes out there and rents a duplex. This is an oilfield boomtown now in '48. And-- and our neighbors in this duplex were hookers. Norah O'Donnell: Really? Former President George W. Bush: Yeah. And we shared the bathroom with them. And-- Norah O'Donnell: What did Barbara Pierce Bush think about that? Former President George W. Bush: Yeah, I don't know. (LAUGH) But I'm-- I thankfully was not old enough to know. Norah O'Donnell: When I talked to your mom last time, she said that he never says, \"No,\" to her. Former President George W. Bush: Well that's why they stayed married for 70 years. It's a true love story. As Mother said, \"It's the only man I ever kissed.\" In 1953 the Bushes lost their second child, Robin, to leukemia when she was only three years old. But the family continued to grow. George W., joined by Jeb, Neil, Marvin, and finally Doro, settled in Houston in 1959. It was there James Baker became almost like a member of the family. \u00a0\u00a0 After Baker lost his first wife to cancer, George Bush asked him to join his campaign for the Senate in 1964, as a way to help him cope with his grief. George Bush's father, Prescott Bush, was a senator from Connecticut until 1963 and approved of his son's decision to join the family business. James Baker: It was pretty much in his blood. George H.W. Bush from archives: I had inculcated to me by a fantastic father a sense of service to my country\u2026 James Baker: He used to go around in-- in some of those early races, and he would say, \"My dad inculcated in me an appreciation of public service.\" I said, \"George, stop talking about inculcated. You're running in Texas. Nobody understands that down here.\" (LAUGHTER) So I think he probably intended to-- to go into politics from the very beginning. He lost that first race for the Senate in 1964 and another one in 1970. But never gave up on the idea he could be president. James Baker: I've never known a more competitive person in my life. Very competitive. Well, he ran for president of the United States when he was an asterisk in the polls. James Baker: Nobody took it seriously. And th-- in '79, people laughed at us. I had people in Texas say, \"Why are you doing this?\" I said, \"Because this is my friend. And I think he will make an extraordinarily good president.\" James Baker is the only man in history to be the White House chief of staff, the secretary of the treasury, and the secretary of state. But the most important role in his life may have been that of \"friend\" to George H.W. Bush. James Baker: He's a huge-- he's a huge part of my life. And--There were a lotta people who helped me along the way. But the guy who really got me going, got me started, turned me around at-- at a time in my life I've said if I were ever gonna become an alcoholic, it's when I lost that wife, and left me with those four small kids. And he was there for me and he's been there for me ever since. During the disputed presidential election of 2000, James Baker led the legal effort that ultimately won the White House for his old friend's eldest son. In the 241-year history of the republic, only two fathers and sons have become president. John Adams and John Quincy Adams and George Herbert Walker Bush and George W. Bush. Norah O'Donnell: How proud of you was he when you became president? Former President George W. Bush: Oh man. He was-- (LAUGH) \u00a0You know, my favorite story about all that is I just gotten sworn in and Andy Card said, \"Why don't you go down to the Oval and see what it feels like as president.\" And I said, \"Okay.\" So I went down, sitting down there and just kind of taking it all in and in walks dad. Former President George W. Bush: So Andy had told dad that I was down there. And he walks down and I said, \"Mr. President-- welcome.\" He said, \"Thank you, Mr. President.\" And that's pretty much all that was said for a while. And it was a very profound moment for me. Norah O'Donnell: What did he say to you when you were president, what kind of-- Former President George W. Bush: I love you. And, you know, as corny as that sounds to some-- it is the most important words you can hear in life. You don't hear a lotta people say, \"I love you,\" when you're president. (LAUGHTER) Norah O'Donnell: Your father was never comfortable with the word legacy. Former President George W. Bush: Yeah. Neither am I-- Norah O'Donnell: Called it the-- the L word. Right? Former President George W. Bush: Neither am I. Norah O'Donnell: Why? Former President George W. Bush: Because it's-- it's kind of self-serving. You know? Look at me. And the other thing is, is that there's-- if you really think about it the notion of your contributions to the country will never be fully known until there's a passage of time. Norah O'Donnell: But as his eldest son, what would you say his legacy is? Former President George W. Bush: First of all, one of the things about his presidency is that he followed a big figure in presidential politics, Ronald Reagan. I mean, Ronald Reagan cast a giant shadow. And he should. I mean, he's a transformative president. And secondly, historians tends to focus on two-term presidents. And so I feel really good about people, if they analyze not only his accomplishments but his character, they'll say, \"Job well done, George H. W. Bush.\"\u00a0 Produced by Keith Sharman and Erin Horan. Norah O'Donnell is the anchor and managing editor of the \"CBS Evening News.\" She also contributes to \"60 Minutes.\"",

            "article_content": "More than 200,000 people attended the March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, the culmination of weeks of activism by students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in February. The students called for stricter gun control and promised to hold politicians accountable at the ballot box if they don't act to prevent gun violence. Five of those students -- Jaclyn Corin, Ryan Deitsch, Delaney Tarr, Cameron Kasky and Emma Gonzalez -- joined us to discuss the march and why they think their movement is different than past efforts to curb access to guns. The following is a transcript of the interview with the students that aired Sunday, March 25, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Today we welcome five of those student activists: Jaclyn Corin, Ryan Deitsch, Delaney Tarr, plus Cameron Kasky and Emma Gonzalez. Emma, what was that like watching yourself on tape there? EMMA GONZALEZ: It was kind of weird. I mean in the moment it felt so good to finally say it because of course it's really stressful the whole day you're waiting and waiting and waiting and I was the last one. So it had just been building up and it felt so good to finally say it. BRENNAN: Cameron, what is the overarching policy goal here? I mean what are you asking for here in Washington? CAMERON KASKY: Well here in Washington we are demanding an assault weapons ban. We are demanding the prohibition of sales of high capacity magazines and we are demanding universal background checks which is something you'll see from the polls pretty much the entire country is behind and yet we've seen nothing of it. BRENNAN: Well you did have a statement from the White House yesterday where the president said he appreciated you all celebrating your first amendment right. And pointed that his administration banned bump stocks they enacted the Stop School Violence Act which authorized grants to increase school safety and some actions to improve background check records. Do all you consider that progress? JACLYN CORIN: You know the Stop School Violence Act doesn't even mention the word gun once. Obviously, school safety is important but it doesn't just happen in schools. And people need to understand that it's a public safety issue not a school safety issue. So we need to protect-- We need to fight the problem from the core which is guns. KASKY: You'll notice in all these shootings-- not just the ones in schools and movie theaters, airports, churches, nightclubs-- there's no specific mental health issue that you can tie to every single one. The only thing you could tie to every single one is weapons that belong in the hands of soldiers in the hands of citizens who are untrained. BRENNAN: Do you think that the more than 200,000 people who came out yesterday agree with all of the points that you have been asking for here? Delaney? KASKY: Well, we got some news DELANEY TARR: I mean I do believe that even if they - there's some difference in opinion on some small issues ultimately the fact is that all of these people coming to the largest march on Washington, because it is the largest march on Washington, they were there because they support the cause. They support safety. They support our lives and protecting our lives. And that's what matters. Even if there is some small issue that they don't necessarily stand with us on they stand with us and that's what matters. RYAN DEITSCH: Well I mean I can say from firsthand as I said the line, 'we need to arm our teachers,' I heard booing from the crowd. I heard they were clearly not behind a message like that. And when I turned it around to say that they need to be armed with pens, pencils, paper and the money they need to support themselves, you could see the crowd regain support, regain like... BRENNAN: You confused people a little bit on that. DEITSCH: So there were - I did confuse a lot of people but the crowd was very like-minded because they all were on the same page that they just didn't want to see all these innocent children die. BRENNAN: Now you all are not just rallying here in Washington. You've also been pushing in your home state of Florida. But Florida did just decide that they're going to allow training of some teachers to be armed. Some districts can opt out. Do you feel like you lost the argument back at home? KASKY: Not at all. As a matter of fact in Florida they passed a bill that raised the age to 21 added a three day waiting period. These are very small steps in the right direction. But I think you'll notice if all teachers are required to be armed or at least several teachers per building many teachers will quit. We have - every single teacher from my school that I've spoken to said that if there was an armed teacher in their building trained or not they would be out of there. Arming teachers only puts kids more in danger and it puts the teachers in more danger. BRENNAN: Were you surprised to see action in your home state before you saw it in Washington? CORIN: Yes very much so because Rick Scott is funded by the NRA. BRENNAN: Your governor. CORIN: Yes, our governor and he defied it in a sense. And the NRA in turn sued the state of Florida. So that's obviously a step in the right direction. He's running for senator so that might have been a reason why he did it to get the popular vote but it's still a step. BRENNAN: You're cynical? You're political gaming here, huh?. I mean you are student class president is that right? CORIN: Yeah. BRENNAN: When you're looking at this kind of political activism right now are you inspired that you want to actually become politically involved after you graduate? CORIN: 100 percent yeah. BRENNAN: You want to run for office yourself someday? CORIN: Maybe so. I mean I wasn't really politically involved before this. But I've learned so much in a matter of a month and a half that it's intrigued me. Poli Sci, yeah. BRENNAN: We're going to take a break in a few seconds so we don't have much time here and then we'll come back and finish the conversation but quickly-- can you raise your hand if you're going to be voting in November? Are you eligible to vote? (All students raise their hands except Kasky.) CORIN: My birthday is in October so I hit the mark. KASKY: I'm not a Russian computer so I can't vote in the next election. But for the one vote I can't cast we'll have thousands for us. BRENNAN: And do you have congressional candidates who have signed on to your agenda? GONZALEZ: We're not endorsing any political figures. BRENNAN: Are they endorsing your platform? KASKY: We endorse ideas not people. TARR: If they choose to support us then we absolutely we, we love that. We want, we want support. But we're not endorsing any particular candidates. BRENNAN: We have to take a real quick short break but I want all of you to stay with us and all of you at home as well. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. I'm Margaret Brennan. We continue our conversation with Stoneman Douglas High School students Jaclyn Corin, Ryan Deitsch and Delaney Tarr, plus Cameron Caskey and Emma Gonzalez. You guys are more than-than students. You've become activists. You've had this incredible turn out not just here in Washington but around the country. Emma, how do you keep this momentum going? GONZALEZ: We're going to be pushing for, just as Ryan was saying, we're going to be revving up for the election. This is not the end. This was just the beginning. We're going to over the summer we're going to try to, you know, go around to colleges and stuff in our communities, reach out to the kids locally all around the country. And we didn't just have support all over the country. We support all over the world. We had like almost 900 marches yesterday. BRENNAN: What did that feel like? GONZALEZ: It was amazing. BRENNAN: I mean what did you do after the march? Did you go home and watch the news coverage? GONZALEZ: We went to eat some food and we had a nice hang out at the hotel which is why my voice is so horse because I was screaming like the whole night. KASKY: We-- You know moving forward it's all about registering to vote, educating others and starting more of a conversation so more people get politically involved because again the youth of America needs to step up and start voting. You'll see the statistics. It's an embarrassing turn out. One in five people in the last election showed up in the 18 to, was it, 29 demographic? CORIN: 18 to 29. KASKY: And-- BRENNAN: And you think-- for you all at this table you have become single-issue voters. You won't back someone or vote for them unless they sign onto the agenda that you laid out? GONZALEZ: We're not backing anybody in general and we're not single-issue voters at all-- BRENNAN: But when you do get the chance to vote that is something-- you won't vote for someone who doesn't support what you're asking for? CORIN: Yeah, it should be something that is at the forefront of the political conversation. It kills more people a year than leukemia. It's an epidemic that we need to face. BRENNAN: But which-- specifically someone has to call for a ban on AR-15s for you to vote for them? CORIN: I mean, I would favor that candidate over another one that-- as long as they support some of our ideals more so than the other person, I would vote for them TARR: And we know that this is an issue of compromise and not necessarily in every state we're going to have a politician who is asking for everything that we're asking for, but we want more than anything our voters to make educated votes. We want them to know what it is they're voting on and that's what we've been pushing because even if they don't necessarily always agree with us, our country needs to know what they're voting on. We can't have them stand behind when there's issues like this that need to be at the forefront of the conversation. Like Jackie said this needs to be a centralized issue in the next election. KASKY: From what you've seen from very recent polls -- we were at Fox News this morning we saw a poll they put out -- the American people are starting to not be interested in putting anybody into office who's on the NRA's payroll. BRENNAN: Well, we actually also have a poll ourselves that I wanted to cite to you. The CBS News YouGov poll shows two thirds of those surveyed say they need to agree with their candidate for the midterm elections on the issue of gun control. So what we see in November is going to be heavily influenced they're saying by where that candidate stands on gun control. That's consistent among Democrats, Republicans and independents. CORIN: As it should be. GONZALEZ: Because this is a non-party issue. This is bipartisan. KASKY: And this is one of the issues at the forefront of our nation right now because as you've seen there have been shootings since the one at Stoneman Douglas. This violence isn't going to end unless we do something concrete. BRENNAN: And yet you didn't see the change that you were asking for immediately. This for you is a long-term campaign? DEITSCH: Well it's- it's the government, their bureaucracy and they will continually bog things down. I mean the Stop School Violence Act if you actually read the whole thing it doesn't really do much. Most of it is already things that have been done especially in our school. A lot of those were already checked off. But these things still happened. I mean it's just going to continue to happen unless we change something. KASKY: That bill, the silent rhetoric behind it is that since the government will never agree on anything, let's pass something very easy and simple that everyone can get behind. But that's because it doesn't do anything. This-- that bill does nothing to keep the students or people outside of schools outside of the line of fire and we're fighting for people everywhere. BRENNAN: That bill you're talking about Fix NICS? You're talking about-- ALL: Stop School Violence Act. KASKY: This isn't just in schools. We met with people from communities, who have who are frightened to leave their houses because-- and who have woken up to the sound of gunshots very frequently. This is everywhere. This is an epidemic. And to Stop School Violence Act does almost nothing to stop it. It doesn't say the word gun once. It doesn't say the words background checks once and 97 percent of the country in a poll showed that they support universal background checks. Anyone who doesn't, I don't understand that. BRENNAN: All right. Well all of you, as you say, you're going to continue to work on this. We'll continue to track what you get done. Thank you very much for coming here. Congratulations-- ALL: Thank you. BRENNAN: --On the rally, I know you're all very excited about that. We'll be right back.",

MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: Today on FACE THE NATION: The president makes some bold personnel moves and suggests there are more to come. But is the firing of Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe by Attorney General Jeff Sessions that has sparked a controversy that has Washington reeling.  Long a topic of conversation in Washington, the when will Rex Tillerson go question was answered Tuesday, when President Trump dismissed him by tweet.  CIA Director Mike Pompeo was named to replace Tillerson as the nation's top diplomat, with Gina Haspel, current number two at the CIA, moving up to the director's spot. If confirmed, she will be the first woman to hold that job.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm really at a point where we're getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRENNAN: Kentucky Republican Rand Paul says he will block the president's nominees to State and the CIA. We will talk with him and Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, who has a prickly relationship with the president, but is responsible for getting the new secretary of state confirmed.  Maine independent Angus King will be here to talk about Russia and the firing of Andrew McCabe.  We will also sit down with the South Korean foreign minister to get an update on the potentially historic meeting between President Trump and North Korean Kim Jong-un.  All of that, plus plenty of political analysis are coming right up on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan.  After a week at the White House filled with speculation about who the president would dismiss next, late Friday night, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. McCabe was former FBI Director Jim Comey's deputy. He had announced his departure months ago and was just hours away from being able to retire with his full pension.  But the firing sparked a fierce debate over whether it was justified or if it's an assault on federal law enforcement. Outrage intensified when the president's attorney, John Dowd, called for an end to the Mueller probe, which could be seen as an attempt to influence the ongoing investigation into Russian investigation meddling.  We begin with Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He joins us from Bowling Green this morning.  Senator, we do want to talk to you about your opposition to the president's nominees for the State Department and the CIA. But, first, I want to ask you about the Mueller investigation and the firing of Andrew McCabe this morning. The president has had a lot to say about the special counsel's investigation, and it comes in the wake of news that his lawyers received questions from Mueller's team and that the Trump Organization itself has been subpoenaed.  Do you believe his statements are an attempt to influence the investigation?  SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: Sure.  Any time the president speaks, I'm sure it has influence on public opinion. I don't know how much influence that has on the investigation.  I would say that the facts with regard to McCabe are very important. It appears that the facts are from the inspector general's office, and the inspector general is something I'm a big fan of. They're objective. They are not partisan. They look at the facts.  They basically have said that McCabe leaked classified documents. That's illegal. But then he also lied about leaking classified documents.  And so the FBI are sticklers on this. And they don't tolerate lying from their agents. And so, if all that is true, I see no way that he could continue in his office, and that punishment is appropriate.  I mean, look at it in comparison to General Flynn. General Flynn has been offered a year in jail for lying about something or misleading the FBI about something that was actually legal. So, here we have an instance where McCabe does something illegal and lies about it. I would say this is a greater offense than Flynn.  BRENNAN: Have you seen the results of the investigation into Andrew McCabe, which have not been made public? And are you saying you agree he should have been fired?  PAUL: If the facts are true as they have been reported in the media, that McCabe lied about releasing classified documents, yes, it's against the law to release classified documents and against the law to lie about it if the FBI asks you about it.  So, that would be two significant infractions. And if they're true, absolutely he should be fired.  BRENNAN: But you don't know that he did that? You haven't seen evidence that he did that, is what you're saying?  PAUL: Only what the news is reporting on this.  And that's what everyone in the news says, that this is what happened, that he leaked -- he illegally leaked classified documents and then lied about it.  BRENNAN: The president also tweeted that there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the FBI, at the Justice Department and the State Department.  Are you concerned that there is some sort of chill effect that might be going through federal law enforcement in the wake of this firing and the president's statements?  PAUL: I'm afraid that the FBI has been terribly damaged by all of this, really starting with James Comey.  And I think there's been this politicization of it. I think James Comey could well have cost Hillary Clinton the election by basically not indicting, but then saying she was guilty as heck in a press conference.  And then I think they reversed course and then went over the top on Trump. Really, the FBI needs to learn to stay out of politics. And here is the problem. And from the beginning of our country, Madison warned about this, that men are not angels.  So, you have people at the FBI that turn out to be very biased, McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page. This is why I have been advocating that no one should be allowed to search Americans' data, Republican or Democrat, without asking a judge for permission through a warrant.  This is the institutional reform that I have been advocating. And it means that bias can come from either side. But law enforcement has such enormous power, it needs to be held in check and balanced by judiciary -- by the judiciary.  BRENNAN: Because of the slim Republican majority, your vote will be key here and much needed if the president wants to got his new secretary of state nominee confirmed, Mike Pompeo.  What do you need to hear from him to change your vote from a no to a yes?  PAUL: I have been very supportive of the president on taxes, regulation, the judiciary.  But when it comes to foreign policy, the thing I liked about President Trump was his opposition to the Iraq War. I guess what I'm perplexed by is that he keeps nominating people around him on foreign policy who actually thought the Iraq War was so good that they want to have an Iran war now.  And so I think the lesson of the Iraq War was that there are unintended consequences from regime change. And so I don't think somebody being the head of secretary of state who wants regime change in Iran is a good thing or wants regime change in North Korea.  You really want a diplomat to be in charge of the State Department, not someone who is advocating for war. So, I can't vote for Pompeo.  On Haspel, my main concern about her is that she oversaw an illegal black ops operation in Thailand that included torture. And I don't think torture is what America is about.  BRENNAN: Well, the CIA is looking at declassifying the details of exactly what her job was.  They have not confirmed that she ran that black site. But why don't you withhold your judgment on her until you see the details of her 33-year career?  PAUL: Because I think there is ample information out there. And it's not disputed that she ran the black ops operation in Thailand, that she did oversee enhanced interrogation.  In fact, her colleagues have said that she was an enthusiastic supporter of this enhanced interrogation, or water-boarding, or torture, as most of us have come to believe it.  There is also evidence that she signed a cable to destroy the evidence. There were videotapes, which I'm sure were ghastly, of the simulated drowning. And these were destroyed with her support and advocacy when she returned home to Washington.  So, I think there's got to be plenty of good people at the CIA who weren't involved with torture. And, really, we're supposed to be the symbol of hope for the world. And people who want freedom from totalitarianism, they want freedom from torture.  They don't want the freedom to torture. And so I think this sets a terrible -- this sets a terrible example for the world.  (CROSSTALK)  BRENNAN: To be clear, though, that was U.S. policy at the time. That wasn't her individual policy. But just to...  PAUL: She was at a high enough...  BRENNAN: ... quickly fact-check you on something there, sir, the investigator who looked into some of what you're talking about with those tapes, the CBS News security contributor, the former number two the CIA, Mike Morell, did clear Haspel, saying she didn't order the destruction, her superior did. She just drafted the cable.  PAUL: Yes.  BRENNAN: Does that change your view of her?  PAUL: I think she was -- I think she was a willing participant in water-boarding. I think she was a willing participant in destroying the tapes.  It wasn't her standing up and making a principled stand and saying, I'm going to the president, I'm not going to destroy these tapes. It was her writing the memo. And who actually advocated for it, her or her superior, there's no that she was protesting against torture. There's every evidence that she was covering it up.  This is not what we stand for as a people. We stand for freedom and hope. We can't be the country that torture prisoners. And I have got three young members of my family in the military. I don't want every enemy around the world to think, oh, it's OK to torture people because the Americans do it.  I don't want my family to be captured and for other countries to think, oh, torture is OK. Absolutely, we cannot have her be the symbol of this.  (CROSSTALK)  PAUL: Excuse me?  BRENNAN: Will you filibuster these nominations?  PAUL: Yes, I will do everything to stop -- now, I don't have the power to stop her nomination.  If there's enough votes, she will eventually win. But there are few things in life where it is worth standing up and saying, enough is enough, this is wrong.  This is -- this is beneath contempt. We are not a people that should be so fearful or so vengeful that we think that torture is somehow acceptable. On what level could torture ever be acceptable?  No, we should make a stand on this. She should never lead the CIA. And one other reason is, they have such enormous power to destroy lives. They can listen to all the phone conversations of the world. They can assassinate people with drones. We should not have someone at the top who has actually been an advocate of or a participant in torture.  BRENNAN: Well, Gina Haspel will speak her piece when she has that confirmation hearing.  Thank you, Senator.  We turn now to Maine independent Senator Angus King, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He joins us from Carrabassett Valley, his home state, this morning.  Good morning, sir.  I want to give you a chance as well to respond to the firing of FBI's Deputy Andrew McCabe. It came just hours before his retirement, when he would have been allowed to receive full benefits. What is your reaction?  SEN. ANGUS KING (I), MAINE: Well, I think the first reaction is much as Rand Paul said, that I think we got to see that inspector general's report.  I don't want to go on press reports with pieces of it. A long time ago, I learned there are two sides to every story. And I want to see what the inspector general says. I want to see what Andrew McCabe has in the way of a response.  But even if you assume for a moment that the inspector general's report said he did these -- he had these violations of the code of the FBI, if you will, my problem is the timing and the way it all worked.  It just seems mean-spirited to come down on a guy within 48 hours of his scheduled retirement. He had 21 years of exceptional service in the FBI.  So, it was clearly rushed. And I think there are questions about that and whether the administration was putting pressure on the Justice Department to take this action.  The whole thing appears, at least at this point -- we're going to find out more in the coming weeks, but it appears to have been compressed in order to take vengeance on this guy for some reason. And I don't think that's the way we should be governing.  So, we have to find out the facts of what he did. And if he did, then some punishment was necessary. But to rush it through in order to take his pension away from him within a few hours of the end of his tenure strikes me, as I said, mean-spirited.  BRENNAN: Your fellow Intel Committee member Mark Warner has called on all members of Congress to speak out in defense of the special counsel.  The president has a lot to say about Robert Mueller this morning. His own personal attorney, John Dowd, has called for an end to the Mueller probe. What do you make of that?  KING: I think it's a huge mistake for the president. I think it's very dangerous for the country.  Robert Mueller is as straight an arrow as there is in America. He's a former Marine. He's a prosecutor. I think he's a Republican. He was -- when he was appointed, everybody said, hooray, this is the right guy.  And now he's just doing his job. And for the administration to keep trying to undercut what they're trying to do, the president keeps saying there's no story here, they didn't do anything wrong.  If they didn't do anything wrong, why are they going to such extreme lengths to undermine this investigation, which is being carried out in a very responsible way? You have noticed there haven't been many, if any leaks from the Mueller investigation, nonpolitical. They're trying to get to the bottom of a very complicated set of facts.  And anybody that says there's nothing to it, well, they have already had three or four guilty pleas and 15 or 20 indictments. That tells me that there is something going on here, and there's something serious. It may or may not involve the Trump campaign or the president, but it certainly involves a lot of other people.  This is a serious investigation. And if the president tries to terminate it prematurely, I think it will be a true constitutional crisis.  BRENNAN: What is the top question you have for Gina Haspel when she comes before your committee?  KING: Well, the reason question I have is, OK, what did you have to do with this so-called enhanced interrogation, which Rand Paul quite properly pointed out is actually torture?  And I particularly interested in the destruction of the videotape, because that was, as I understand it, against the instructions of the general counsel of the CIA. Somebody knew they were doing something wrong. I think the CIA should declassify as much surrounding this circumstance as possible, so she can answer these questions in an open setting, and the American people can understand what the context was.  I'm very, very troubled by this. And, as Senator Paul said, it seems to me there may be other people qualified to do this job that weren't involved in what John McCain has characterized one of the darkest moments of our recent history.  BRENNAN: You did vote for John Brennan to become CIA director. He was higher-ranking within the agency at the time when these practices, as you call it torture, were carried out.  How did you reconcile that? Why vote for him and withhold it for her?  KING: Well -- well, because we determined -- and there was lot of examination -- that he wasn't directly involved in the decision-making. He was there. He was an executive at the CIA.  But she was on the spot. At least, that's what -- and, again, we're talking about material that isn't fully in the public sphere. And that's why first thing I said was, the CIA should declassify as much of this as is remotely possible, so that we can all make a full judgment.  But her involvement was much more direct and hands-on, if you will, than John Brennan's. And, also, John came forth basically said, I regret that we did this.  One of the questions I want to ask her is, how do you feel about what went on, and what is your view looking back? And the other thing we have to think about, Margaret, is, she's going to work for a president who has said water-boarding is no big deal.  And although it's the law of the land that it can't be done now, is he going to try to change that? And is she going to follow orders from a president that tells her to do something that's contrary to the law because she was involved in this project 15 years ago?  So, those are the kinds of questions I think she's going to have to answer.  BRENNAN: And if she says she personally disagrees, it would be enough to switch your vote?  KING: Well, I'm not sure.  It's the whole context.  BRENNAN: OK.  KING: I want to listen to her explanation and how she reacts to the questions.  BRENNAN: Got it.  Senator, thank you very much for joining us this morning.  We will be back with more FACE THE NATION in one minute.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: Earlier, we sat down with Tennessee Senator Bob Corker. He's head of the Foreign Relations Committee and also happens to be one of the president's toughest critics in the Republican Party.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  BRENNAN: You're leaving the Senate. And you have been pretty candid in your past about what you thought of where the president was.  You questioned his stability. You questioned his competence.  Do you have a reason now that you're being more careful in your language? Have you fixed your relationship with the president?  SEN. BOB CORKER (R), TENNESSEE: Well, look, I don't think people realize that we never stopped talking.  When you say being more careful, I'm -- again, I'm assessing things as they are. And, as I just mentioned, there has been a lot of progress made. Sometimes, it's a little uncanny as to how it happens. And it's very unorthodox.  The president, just like a lot of businesspeople, just picks up the phone, and sometimes things happen in a good way, sometimes not. But we have made some -- we have made progress in North Korea. There's no question.  BRENNAN: You think progress is a meeting?  CORKER: Well, I'm really talking about the things we have done to bring the international community together to put us in a place where discussions can take place.  The Iran deal will be another issue. It's coming up in May. And right now, it doesn't feel like it's going to be extended. I think the president likely will move away from it, unless my -- our European counterparts really come together on a framework.  And it doesn't feel to me that they are. Now, as we get within two weeks of the May 12 date, that could change. But...  BRENNAN: You think the president is going to pull out of that Iran deal May 12?  CORKER: I do. I do.  BRENNAN: Now you have this timeline in May, where you could see the U.S. pulling out of a nuclear deal with Iran, at the same time it's starting to negotiate with North Korea about its nuclear program.  Do you think it makes things harder to get anywhere with North Korea?  CORKER: I don't. I mean, I know people...  BRENNAN: You don't think they're related?  CORKER: I don't.  Look, I -- I have used that argument, OK? But, at the end of the way, I think this -- this whole situation with North Korea and the way that it's shaping up right now, as I mentioned, is somewhat unorthodox.  And I think you're dealing with a leader there that probably doesn't think the same way that other countries and their leadership might. So, I'm not sure that it's going to end up having a detrimental effect.  BRENNAN: Do you think the president should sit down with Kim Jong-un?  CORKER: I think it's fine. Look, it's going to happen.  BRENNAN: You do believe that meeting is going to happen?  CORKER: I think, ultimately, it happens. I do.  You already seen -- you have seen the administration sort of move away from an instant meeting. They have said that they don't know exactly when it's going to occur. And I think there's...  BRENNAN: So, maybe not May, which is when...  (CROSSTALK)  CORKER: Well, I think you're seeing that happen because of the realities of what you have to do in preparation to make sure that it's successful.  It takes awhile for that to occur. We do have back channels ourselves, by the way, to North Korea. And we have our ways of setting things like that up in an appropriate manner.  BRENNAN: And do you think Mike Pompeo, who is currently at the CIA, but will ultimately face confirmation ahead of your committee to become secretary of state, is he the right person to be leading that diplomacy? Is he already laying some of this groundwork?  CORKER: I think he became aware of his situation over the weekend.  And you saw where he had already briefed himself up on North Korea a little bit more fully than he otherwise would have probably. It's my sense that Pompeo is much more aligned with the president.  And so I think one of the questions he will get during the hearing process is just ensuring that he's going to be giving honest assessments and that full range of options to the president as decisions are being made.  My sense is, though, they will get along. They will move much more fully together as they move down the path on foreign policy.  BRENNAN: Do you expect to have a new secretary of state by May?  CORKER: Look, it's -- Margaret, as you know, we're moving into the -- sort of the election season, and things are beginning to feel slightly more partisan. I hope that's the case, but we will see.  BRENNAN: Rand Paul says he's going to block the nomination.  CORKER: Well, we have 21 members. And so it takes 11. And we have one member who said they would oppose him.  There were two Democrats who voted for Pompeo on the floor as -- who are members of the committee -- for CIA.  BRENNAN: Have you spoken with Rex Tillerson since he was fired?  CORKER: I had a long conversation with him, yes.  BRENNAN: How is he doing?  CORKER: I think he's doing fine.  I think he feels he knows he's laid the groundwork for North Korea. I know he feels like he's moved things along in a good way, wants to have a very good transition with Pompeo. He's a class act in that regard.  So, I think he's at peace. I think he obviously wanted to stay a year. He moved beyond that. I think he was planning to be here this -- this entire year also, to make it two.  But, look, I think he feels like he served his country well and knows that the president needs to have his own secretary of state or one that he more gels fully with.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  BRENNAN: And you can see our full interview with Senator Corker on our Web site at FACETHENATION.com.  We will be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: We want to go now to Moscow and CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer, where today's presidential election is taking place against the backdrop of new sanctions and expelled diplomats -- Liz.  ELIZABETH PALMER, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.  As you can see, it's a beautiful day today here in Moscow, which may have helped voter turnout. Certainly, from what we saw at the polling stations this morning, it looked pretty heavy.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  PALMER (voice-over): All the signs of a real contest are here, but everyone knows how it's going to turn out. And President Putin should be announcing his victory in a few hours' time.  That will make him the longest continuously serving leader in Russian history, beating the record set by Joseph Stalin.  The U.K. government certainly won't be sending its congratulations. Britain's foreign secretary has said it's likely Putin himself decided to poison the Russian exile Sergei Skripal with nerve agent.  BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY: We think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision.  PALMER: In retaliation, Britain said it would expel 23 Russian diplomats. Then Moscow responded tit for tat and announced it would expel 23 British diplomats.  Meanwhile, Moscow was also taking heat from Washington last week, when the U.S. Treasury announced fresh sanctions against Russia for meddling in the election and staging cyber-attacks.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  PALMER: Now, in retaliation for that, the Russians have announced that they will be expanding their so-called black list, which is a list of Americans who are not allowed to visit or do business in Russia, although it's worth noting they have never made the contents of that list public -- Margaret.  BRENNAN: Liz, thank you.  We will be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.  White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short, he is with us. Lots of questions for him when we come back, so stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I'm Margaret Brennan.  We turn now to Marc Short, White House director of legislative affair, to get the administration's perspective on all that is going on in Washington.  Marc, you're a busy man.  Let's start on the nominations question.  MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR: Yes.  BRENNAN: Republicans really can't afford to lose a single vote. You just heard Senator Rand Paul says -- saying he opposes both the nominee to be CIA and the secretary of state. How do you get enough votes to get your guys through?  SHORT: Well, we think we have two incredibly qualified candidates there. Mike Pompeo, as you know, graduated top of his class at West Point, graduated top of his class at Harvard Law School, served our country with distinction in uniform, served our country with distinction in Congress. He's done a phenomenal job at restoring morale at the CIA. We think he is a phenomenal choice. He earned 15 Democrat votes in his confirmation only a year ago.  BRENNAN: You're going to need some of those Democrats this time too.  SHORT: Well, I think it's unfortunate where Rand Paul's position is and before the hearings begin and getting some of the answers to his questions. I think that, you know, Rand himself ran for president on policy. This kind of -- to put your head in the sand about North Korea and Iran and just hope they don't development nuclear weapons, that's out of -- that's out of sync with the rest of the American people, which is why they went a different direction.  But we think there's enough Democrats that will help support our candidates. And I think with Gina Haspel, you know, as you mentioned in your previous interview, 33 years of service in the CIA, station chief in multiple, the most dangerous places in the globe. Somebody who has earned the sport not just of Republican people who have run the CIA, but also Democrat heads. People like Leon Panetta. People like Brennan. People like Clapper. And even not in the CIA, but in the intelligence community. So she has broad, bipartisan support. We think she'll earn the support of many Democrats in her confirmation hearing too.  BRENNAN: Will the president agree to allow the CIA to publicly release information, the details of her background that Rand Paul and Angus King say they want to hear more about?  SHORT: I'm sure that we're going to look to provide as much information as necessary, without compromising any international secrets. So we're going to want to be cooperative. But, again, I think that we have two incredibly qualified candidates. The president's very excited that he's nominated them. And that -- looks forward to putting them in office as soon as possible.  And, you know, Margaret, as we -- as we face negotiations with North Korea, it's all the more important that this happen expeditiously. It's important that members come together and make sure these conformations happen quickly in the next coming weeks.  BRENNAN: But this was a decision the president made. And you're saying you need a secretary of state. Well, he had one until he fired him.  SHORT: Well, that's true, Margaret, but I think that the reality is that these are negotiations that are now beginning. It's important the president be on the same page with the secretary of state, who he works with and agrees with on many fronts. And so we -- we think that Congress should work quickly.  We're very frustrated at the pace of Congress in many nominations. As you and I have discussed off camera, the reality is that so far the number of filibusters in our nominees is four times greater in one year than the last four presidents combined in their entire first terms. It's really reaching an historic obstruction.  BRENNAN: And behind on nominations, too.  But I want to ask you about the place you work every day.  Senator Jeff Flake said Republicans should come out against the president if he starts attacking Robert Mueller, that that is a red line. The president's had a lot to say about the special counsel this morning. Are you hearing outcry from Republicans?  SHORT: I've not heard a lot of outcry from Republicans. In all due respect to Jeff Flake, I'm not sure as far as him representing the Republican Party, couldn't get re-elected in his own state today. So the reality is --  BRENNAN: You think Republicans are OK with the kind of (INAUDIBLE) the president is having this morning?  SHORT: I'm not -- I -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't think that the president or anybody right now in our White House is suggesting not cooperating in any way with the Mueller investigation. We've cooperated every single way. Naturally there's --  BRENNAN: The president's attorney called for an end to (INAUDIBLE) --  SHORT: Everyone in the White House has cooperated on this. And what I said is, is that we have cooperated in every single way, every single paper they've asked for, every single interview. And I think the reality, Margaret, is that, yes, there's a growing frustration that after more than a year and millions and millions of dollars spent on this, there remains no evidence of collusion with Russia.  BRENNAN: The investigation's ongoing.  SHORT: Of course it is.  BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE) --  SHORT: It's ongoing over a year. And it's been ongoing also in both the House and the Senate during their own independent investigation where the House has concluded there was no collusion.  I think at some point the American people are owed an answer to say, OK, if there is no collusion, how much longer will this drag on?  BRENNAN: Well, that is why they Justice Department put that special counsel in place, saying that the American people deserve an answer to that question of what Russia's influence was. So, in these public statements, isn't the president appearing to discredit or attempt to discredit the outcome of that?  SHORT: I think the president's expressing his frustration, which I think is well warranted and merited. As I said, there has been no evidence whatsoever of collusion. There's been millions and millions of dollars spent at taxpayer expense trying to uncover this.  And the reality is that there's two separate issues here. One is Russia interference, Margaret. And if you look at Russian interference, this administration has imposed sanctions. This administration has helped to arm Ukraine with defensive weapons to protect against Russian aggression. This administration partnered with NATO condemning the most recent murders in Britain by Russia. The previous -- the previous -- the previous -- the previous administration -- the previous --  BRENNAN: Right, but the president hasn't tweeted about those things today (INAUDIBLE) we didn't (ph) ask you (ph) about Ukraine.  SHORT: Well the previous Obama administration did absolutely nothing as far as combating interference in the elections. So this administration has taken action.  As it relates to collusion, there is none.  BRENNAN: How's morale at the White House? We know the chief of staff held a meeting this week to reassure people.  SHORT: Morale on our team is great, Margaret. I think the reality is we're --  BRENNAN: The legislative team.  SHORT: We're -- I think the reality is, is what the American people want to know is, despite the media's coverage of who's up, who's down, what's the latest palace intrigue --  BRENNAN: The secretary of state was fired this week.  SHORT: They want to know, what's the latest palace intrigue?  BRENNAN: That's -- that's not the media.  SHORT: What the American people want to know is, what is the unemployment rate? It's the lowest in 17 years. How are jobs doing? Lowest unemployment rate for Hispanic-Americans in history. Lowest for African-Americans in history. You see an economy that's growing again.  BRENNAN: But you're -- you're confident that the -- the staffers you're working with, you come to work every day, feel that their jobs are safe? I mean why did the chief of staff have to have that meeting (ph)?  SHORT: Any time -- any time in this environment there's always going to be lot of turmoil, Margaret. That's something you sign up for. You recognize you serve at the pleasure of the president. We sign up knowing that we're trying to do the will of the American people.  And as you look at the records of this administration and what the American people are pleased at with the way the economy is growing and the way that they are being protected, ISIS having lost 99 percent of the territory it contained prior to this administration, we're making America safer, the economy is booming, 4.5 million Americans have either received a wage increase or bonus since the tax plan came into effect. The economy, where we are as a country, the consumer sentiment reached a 20 year high just this week.  BRENNAN: Yes. All right. Well, Marc, you got a lot of work to do this week. Thank you very much for making the time to come on the show.  SHORT: Thanks for having me on, Margaret.  BRENNAN: We'll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: It's been 10 days since President Trump accepted North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un's invitation to meet. But there's still been no public response from North Korea. Yesterday I spoke with South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-Wha, who was in town for talks on trade and North Korea. That's where our conversation began.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  BRENNAN: Have you heard anything from North Korea in response?  KANG KYUNG-WHA, SOUTH KOREA'S FOREIGN MINISTER: Well, nothing publicly. But there is the channel of communication now established. So I'm sure there are back and forth messages.  But I think the North Korean leader would also need some time given the readiness with which President Trump has accepted the invitation to talks. I think we were all quite surprised by -- by the -- the readiness of that decision. I think it was an extremely courageous decision on the part of President Trump.  We believe the North Korean leader is now taking stock. We give them the benefit of the doubt and the time that he would need to come out with some public messaging.  BRENNAN: So you were surprised President Trump accepted so quickly. Do you think Kim Jong-un was surprised?  KANG: I think we all were.  BRENNAN: Your president, Moon --  KANG: Yes.  BRENNAN: Has plans already --  KANG: Yes.  BRENNAN: To meet with Kim Jong-un next month.  KANG: Uh-huh.  BRENNAN: What does South Korea hope to achieve from that conversation?  KANG: This is, of course, also a very historic engagement. And the North Korean leader is coming just south of the DMZ for the third inter-Korean summit. The two previous ones were held in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. So the indication that he is willing to come south for this is -- is very significant in itself.  BRENNAN: In the talks between North and South Korea, will the nuclear program even be a topic, or are you saving that for President Trump?  KANG: No, we're not saving that for I think President Trump. I think this is a concern, not just for United States, but for South Korea as well. But I think we will want to discuss key security issues, including the denuclearization issue.  BRENNAN: What conditions do the North Koreans have to meet before this conversation happens?  KANG: Well, in effect they already have. We have asked the North to indicate, in clear terms, the commitment to denuclearization. And he has, in fact, conveyed that commitment.  BRENNAN: He's given his word?  KANG: He has given his word. But the significance of his word is -- is quite -- quite weighty in the sense that this is the first time that the -- the words came directly from the North Korean supreme leader himself. And that has never been done before.  BRENNAN: The idea of a North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, meeting with an American president, caught a lot of people by surprise.  KANG: Uh-huh.  BRENNAN: What is the significance of that to South Korea?  KANG: Well, it clearly demonstrates that President Trump's will, determination, to resolve this issue once and for all. And I think that's hugely appreciated by the South Korean public. The previous years, before the administration, has been one of non-action, called strategic patience. What has changed is the maximum pressure campaign, which is a series of Security Council sanctions, but also U.S. unilateral sanctions.  North Korea is in a situation of very limited ability to engage economically with the outside world, which means it has very limited ways of improving its -- the livelihood of the people.  BRENNAN: You're describing a weak North Korea financially.  KANG: Economically, definitely.  BRENNAN: But they've never been this militarily strong when it comes to the development of their nuclear program. They've never come this close to being able to hit the U.S. mainland with a weapon before. So they're actually walking into these talks in a strong position in some ways.  KANG: But the -- I think -- I think that's probably what -- what goes in to the North Korean calculation of coming out to dialogue at this point. But, again, it's -- it's the strength on the -- on the side of its nuclear missiles program, on the side of the economy, very, very weak and increasingly so.  The art of diplomacy and negotiation is this -- what this boils down to.  BRENNAN: What is South Korea and what is the U.S., it's partner, willing to offer North Korea at this negotiation?  KANG: At this point we haven't offered it anything. We had made it clear that we will engage, but there will be no reward for dialogue.  BRENNAN: Does South Korea trust Kim Jong-un?  KANG: As I said, it's not a matter of trusting, it's mean -- it's a matter of discussing and pressing for action. And once you see those actions, then you move forward further.  BRENNAN: When President Trump says things like he did reportedly at this political event earlier this week when he suggested U.S. troops could be removed because of a trade dispute, how are those comments received in South Korea?  KANG: Well, any time troops are mentioned, it raises eyebrows. So, yes, it has caught attention. But we are absolutely confident of the American commitment to the alliance and the troop presence in our country.  BRENNAN: So you don't take comments like that seriously?  KANG: Well, we take any comment coming from the president very seriously. But in -- but, yes, but in the larger scheme of things is this alliance that have been the bedrock of peace and security in the -- in -- on the Korean peninsula, but also the northeast Asia for decades.  BRENNAN: Next week those tariffs on steel and aluminum go into effect.  KANG: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  BRENNAN: What's going to happen to South Korea?  KANG: Well, we've been arguing very much, you know, as ally, and at a particularly -- and a visible alliance at this point when we are trying to make the most of this opportunity that is created to come to terms with the North Korean nuclear issue, that we -- we -- we need -- we need an exemption on this. So we've put all of our arguments and considerations on the table we're hoping for a good result.  BRENNAN: No assurance that you will be exempt yet?  KANG: I think we'll know when the decision is made and announced. But I think we've put -- we're putting the best arguments in place.  BRENNAN: This comes in the middle of what was already tough renegotiation of that U.S. free trade deal with South Korea. So are you concerned that some of this beating up on trade is going to hurt the alliance?  KANG: There have always been trade issues. The steel issue is not entirely new. This is particularly big, but we take it for what it is and try to deal with it.  But, again, yes, coming at this particular time, it -- it's not helpful.  BRENNAN: Minister, thank you.  KANG: Thank you.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  BRENNAN: You can see our full interview with Minter Kang on our website, facethenation.com.  We'll be back in a moment with our political panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: For some political analysis.  Dan Balz is chief correspondent at \"The Washington Post.\" Susan Davis is a congressional correspondent for NPR. And Mark Landler is a White House correspondent at \"The New York Times.\"  Dan, we've been talking a lot about the hirings and firings at the White House this week. You saw late Friday Attorney General Jeff Sessions fire the deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe. Some are saying this will win him a few political points. What do you make of this?  DAN BALZ, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, I think that's probably right. He'll gain some points with the person he needs to gain those most with, and that's the president of the United States, who very much wanted to see McCabe go and had been -- had been tweeting for a long time and making statements that I think put the attorney general in a position where he had to act and had to fire him. And we have seen since that firing the president of the United States come back in and ratify that and push harder on that. So I think that what we -- what we saw was the intimidation coming from the president of the United States.  Again, we haven't seen the -- the report -- the IG report that lays out the rational for the firing. And I think everybody is -- is right in saying we have to see that before we can draw full conclusions. But there clearly was pressure coming from above on the attorney general on this. He was not acting simply as an independence agent.  BRENNAN: And we know that because the president sent a tweet at one point specifically pointing out that McCabe was going to retire for full benefits. And this firing came hours before that would have been possible.  BALZ: Right. And, you know, we've -- we've seen a number of people say, regardless of the merits of the case, the notion that this was rushed in a way as to be punitive and mean spirited is part of the issue that we now -- we now have. And following that, John Dowd's statement yesterday, that this would be a good time for Mueller to close down the investigation, initially suggesting he was speaking for the president, then walking that back, again, raises this question of the pressure that is being put on the Justice Department and on the special counsel.  BRENNAN: Susan, you're already hearing from Jeff Flake. In the past you've heard from Senator Graham say, don't go near Bob Mueller. That's a red line here. Is that for show? I mean Marc Short, from the White House, was saying they haven't heard that kind of outcry from congressional Republicans.  SUSAN DAVIS, CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, NPR: You know what we had heard from congressional leaders like the speaker and the majority leader in the Senate is that they have confidence in Mueller's investigation, that they don't support any effort to interfere with the investigation.  I do think that the interpretation of the president's reaction to the McCabe firing does seem like there is an acceleration of his frustration towards Mueller.  I don't know what happens if the president really does try to close down this investigation or go further with firings at the Justice Department. Congress has really been under Republicans quiet largely about how the president has handled this. They have not been very confrontational with him.  It has been described as a red line. I do think that's fair. I do think Senator Angus King, who you heard earlier on the program say something along those lines would -- would be like a constitutional crisis. And I think he's -- he's accurate in that. I think it's a concern, though, that Republicans at this stage continue to keep private. We did not see much of a reaction coming from Capitol Hill either about the firing of McCabe or his comments about the Mueller investigation. But the concern is real.  BRENNAN: You did have a few comments saying the Judiciary Committee is going to be looking into exactly what happened.  DAVIS: Yes. The question here, too, and as Dan said, it's not -- we don't know a lot about the substance, right? We haven't seen the IG report. But I do think there's a lot of members of Congress that look at this and are -- do raise questions about the timing. And why didn't they make a better case to the public. If -- if the substance is there, if Andrew McCabe did deserve to be fired, if the facts are on your side, then let the facts play out and let the public be on your side. And so the way it was handled, I do think, there is some frustration. Congress has not been very aggressive in its oversight of this administration. This might be something they just simply can't ignore.  BRENNAN: Mark, the president already had quite a week of news after firing his secretary of state, leading to these reports of chaos, upheaval, more changes to come.  What is happening? What is motivating this kind of communication from him today?  MARK LANDLER, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Well, I mean, the president's talked recently about how he's actually getting closer to having the cabinet that he wants in place. And, you know, there's a school of thought that says that --  BRENNAN: He picked the first cabinet.  LANDLER: He picked the first cabinet. But to be fair, he picked some people he didn't know well, people who were recommended to him by outsiders. Rex Tillerson is a good example of that. And now, after 14 months, I think he's coming into his own and I think he's decided he wants to have people around him who agree with him, who see the world the way he does, who don't push back.  One thing about Rex Tillerson is he pushed back on the Iran deal, for example. Mike Pompeo, by all accounts, won't do that. Tillerson was very forward leaning on diplomacy with North Korea at a time when the president wasn't. Pompeo would be much more inclined to line up with the president.  And so I think that we're seeing the president in some sense coming toward having the type of people around him that he's most comfortable with. And then you also have to say, this is a guy who does operate by having a chaotic environment around him. The type of chaos that many people would find untenable, President Trump is comfortable with. He always has been in his business career, and he is now as president.  BRENNAN: It was interesting to me to hear Senator Corker, in our interview, basically say, yes, the Iran deal most likely is dead in May. As you bring up Mike Pompeo, the nominee to be secretary of state, has been a vocal critic of that deal.  I mean what do we extrapolate from some of these changes the president is making to his cabinet?  LANDLER: Well, the Iran deal is an interesting test case because you've got several people on the national security team who have argued strenuously that the president not rip it up.  BRENNAN: H.R. McMaster being one of them.  LANDLER: HR. McMaster, Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, and the secretary -- the former secretary of state. With Pompeo in police, he will now have one less voice making that case. And also, to be sure, the president has gotten more and more impatient each time he's had to make this decision. And so I think Senator Corker is reflecting reality, which is, we're at the end of the line for this deal and without Tillerson's voice there to defend it, the likelihood is much higher he goes ahead and rips it up.  BRENNAN: Dan, you know, also this week you had the president saying that this defeat of Republicans in this Pennsylvania special election wasn't really a defeat, it was in some ways a referendum of Trumpism. Is that how you read Conor Lamb's victory?  BALZ: Not exactly. I mean if you want -- if you want a good example of a great attempt at spin, that was the argument. That one way or another Conor Lamb became the new congressman from that district because he was very Trumpian.  No, I think quite the opposite. I think this was, as we have said many times, this was a district that went 20 percent margin for Donald Trump, but it also went 17 points in favor of Mitt Romney in 2012. This was not just a Trump district, this was a solid Republican district. And the fact that it moved as dramatically as it did is an indication that Republicans have stiff headwinds heading into the midterm election.  Yes, Conor Lamb said some things that put him in a little bit better position in that district. He said he wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader, for example. He talked about being in favor of the Second Amendment. But in many other ways, he ran it on Democratic issues and the turnout was very, very strong.  And so I think we saw two things. One, that there were obviously some people who had voted for Donald Trump in 2016 who ended up voting for Conor Lamb. And the second, which we've seen again and again and again is that the energy and the enthusiasm and the intensity is greater on the Democratic side at this point than it is on the Republican side.  BRENNAN: Susan, so those stiff headwinds change the calculus of those in the Republican Party right now in terms of the willingness to challenge the president?  DAVIS: It is a very tricky thing for Republicans to do that because the one thing that was true, and also in Pennsylvania was true, is Republican voters aren't angry at the president. They still like him. The question is, are they going to show up and vote for people down the ballot? And Democrats face a similar problem under the Obama era, that Democratic voters still liked Barack Obama but they didn't show up in the midterms to support him.  One of the lessons of these midterm elections is that the president can hurt you, but he can't necessarily save you. And that I think Republicans, even though there was some very optimistic spin coming out of this race, a very aware of the fact that the House majority is very much in play. And that if they can't figure out a way to run in an environment where the president has an approval rating in the low 40s, that a lot of unexpected losses could be coming their way.  BRENNAN: Susan, Dan, Mark, thanks for coming on the show.  BALZ: Thank you.  LANDLER: Thank you.  DAVIS: Thank you.  BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching. Until next Sunday, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Ahead of a potential historic meeting with the North Korean leadership, President Trump fired his secretary of state this week, announcing he would nominate current CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Rex Tillerson. Mr. Trump's abrupt dismissal of Tillerson, who had been a vocal proponent of engagement with the North, raised questions about the proposed summit of U.S. and North Korean officials. Sen. Bob Corker, the outgoing Republican from Tennessee, is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of the GOP's most influential foreign policy voices. He joined us to discuss the possible meeting with North Korea, the prospects of Pompeo's nomination in the Senate and a conversation he had with Tillerson after his ouster. The following is a transcript of the interview with Corker that aired Sunday, March 18, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You're leaving the Senate, and you've been pretty candid in your past-- about what you thought of where the president was. You questioned his stability. You questioned his competence. Do you have a reason now that you're being more careful in your language? Have you fixed your relationship with the president? SEN. BOB CORKER: Well, look, you know, I-- I don't think people realize that we never stop talking. When you say be more careful, I'm-- I'm-- again, I'm assessing things as they are. And as I just mentioned-- there has been a lot of progress made. Sometimes it's-- it's a little un-- uncanny as to how it happens, and it's very unorthodox. And the president-- you know, just-- like a lotta business people just picks up the phone. And sometimes-- things happen-- in a good way. Sometimes not. But-- you know, we've made some-- we have made progress in North Korea. There's no question. MARGARET BRENNAN: You think progress is a meeting? SEN. BOB CORKER: Well, I'm-- I'm really talking about the things we've done to bring the international community together to-- to put us in a place where discussions can take-- place. The Iran deal will be another issue that's coming up in May, and-- right now it doesn't feel like it's gonna be extended. I think the president likely-- will move away from it, unless my-- our European counterparts really come together on a framework. And it doesn't feel to me that they are. Now, as we get-- within two weeks of the May 12th date, that could change. But-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You think the president's going to pull out of that Iran deal on May 12th? SEN. BOB CORKER: I do. I do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, you have this timeline in May where you could see the U.S. pulling out of a nuclear deal with Iran at the same time it's starting to negotiate with North Korea about its nuclear program. Do you think it makes things harder to get anywhere with North Korea? SEN. BOB CORKER: I-- I don't. I mean I know people-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think they're related? SEN. BOB CORKER: I-- I don't. I-- look, I-- I have used that argument, okay? But at the end of the day I think this-- this whole situation with North Korea and the way that-- it's shaping up right now is-- as I mentioned, is somewhat unorthodox, and I think you're dealing with-- a leader there that probably doesn't think the same way that other countries and their leadership might. So-- I'm not sure that it's gonna end up having a detrimental effect. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think the president should sit down with Kim Jong Un? SEN. BOB CORKER: I think it's fine-- it-- look, it's going to happen. I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You do believe that meeting's gonna happen? SEN. BOB CORKER: I-- I-- I think ultimately it happens. I do. You've already, you've seen the administration sort of move away from an instant meeting. They've-- said that-- you know, well, they don't know exactly when it's going to occur. And I think there's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So maybe not May, which is when the South Koreans-- SEN. BOB CORKER: Well, I think you're seeing that happen because the realities of what you have to do in preparation to make sure that it's successful. It takes a while for that to occur. We do have back channels ourselves, by the way-- to North Korea. And-- you know, we have our ways of-- of setting things like that up in an appropriate manner. MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- do you think Mike Pompeo, who's currently at the CIA but will ultimately-- face confirmation ahead of your committee to become Secretary of State. Is he the right person to be leading that diplomacy? I mean is he already laying some of this ground work? SEN. BOB CORKER: I think he became aware of his situation-- over the weekend. And you saw where he had already briefed himself up on North Korea a little but more fully than he otherwise would have, probably. It's my sense that Pompeo is much more aligned with the president. And so I think one of the questions he'll get-- you know, during the hearing process, is just ensuring that-- he's gonna be giving honest assessments-- and that full range of options to the president as decisions are being made. My sense is, though, they will get along. They will move much more fully together as they move down the path on foreign policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect to have a new secretary of state by May? SEN. BOB CORKER: Look, it's-- Margaret, as you know, we're moving into the-- sort of the election season, and things are beginning to feel slightly-- more partisan. I hope that's the case, but we'll see-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Rand Paul says he's gonna block the nomination. SEN. BOB CORKER: Well, we have 21 members-- and so it takes 11. And we have one member who said they would oppose him. There were two Democrats who voted for Pompeo on the floor as-- who were members of the committee-- for CIA. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you spoken with Rex Tillerson since he was fired? SEN. BOB CORKER: I had a long conversation with him. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 How is he doing? SEN. BOB CORKER: I think he's doin' fine. I think he-- he feels-- he knows he's laid the groundwork for North Korea. I know he-- he-- he feels like he's moved things along in a good way. Wants to have a very-- good transition with Pompeo. He's a class act in that regard. So I think he's at peace. I think-- he obviously wanted to stay a year. He moved beyond that. I think he was planning to be here this entire-- this entire year also to make it two-- but-- look, I-- I think he-- he feels like he served his country well, and-- and-- knows that-- the president needs to have his own Secretary of State, or one-- one that he more geehaws fully with. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does it concern you, though, that the president seems recently to be making staffing choices based more on ideology and personal beliefs? SEN. BOB CORKER: Ah, look, I-- as-- when the president called from Air Force One the other day to-- to let me know what was happening with Rex-- as I said to him-- every Cabinet member serves at his pleasure. He should have people that he feels-- he has confidence in. And I've been on the speakerphone during these debates. Okay? Where the president will call. He'll have his team of people around him in the Oval Office, and we'll be debating an issue. And I do think he likes to hear diverse opinions, but once a decision is made, I think he likes to see it move along quickly. And I think that was one of the frustrations he may have had with Secretary Tillerson.",

            "article_content": "House Republicans have launched an effort to expand the massive tax law they muscled through Congress last year, aiming to make permanent the individual tax cuts and small-business income deductions now set to expire in 2026. The pre-midterm elections push, which clicked into gear Tuesday, is portrayed as championing the middle class and small businesses. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, who heads the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said making the tax cuts permanent would build on the tax law's economic boost by adding 1.5 million new jobs and increasing wages. With the elections about four months away, polls are showing mixed support among voters for the $1.5 trillion package of individual and corporate tax cuts that President Donald Trump signed into law as his marquee legislative achievement. The new tax proposals are aimed at giving Republican lawmakers a selling point as they prepare to leave Washington to campaign in their districts. \"It's going to identify Republican priorities,\" said Marc Gerson, a former majority tax counsel for the Ways and Means Committee, who now heads the Washington law firm Miller & Chevalier. The new Republican outline also calls for new tax incentives for savings, by creating a \"universal savings account\" for families and allowing the popular, tax-free 529 college savings accounts to also be used to pay for apprenticeship fees and home schooling expenses, as well as paying off student debt. In addition, workers would be able to tap their retirement savings accounts without tax penalty to cover expenses from the birth of a child or an adoption. Start-up businesses would be permitted to write off more of their initial costs. \"We plan to work off this framework to build on the growing successes of the (tax law) and ensure this energized economy continues moving forward,\" Brady said in a statement. The tax law that took effect Jan. 1, the most sweeping rewrite of the U.S. tax code in three decades, is estimated to add around $1.5 trillion to the ballooning deficit. And deficit hawks as well as Democratic lawmakers \u2014 who were unanimous in opposing the tax legislation last year \u2014 wondered Tuesday how the Republicans intended to pay for the extended tax cuts. \"It's amazing to think that Washington's record debt binge by Congress still isn't over,\" Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement. \"This country is drowning in red ink. It is beyond irresponsible to add even a dollar more to the debt, and anyone who cares about fiscal responsibility should dismiss further tax cuts outright.\" Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the new Republican proposal \"doubles down on massive breaks for the rich and sweeteners for high fliers while trying to cover up the broken middle-class promises from their first tax law.\" \"Wages are falling as the cost of living climbs higher and higher,\" Wyden said in a statement. \"Instead of working across the aisle on ways to boost paychecks for working Americans, congressional Republicans laid out a plan to give the fortunate few another round of deficit-exploding tax cuts.\" The new tax law provides steep tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, and more modest reductions for middle- and low-income individuals and families. While the law slashed the corporate tax rate permanently from 35 percent to 21 percent, its tax cuts for individuals and the millions of U.S. \"pass-through\" businesses expire in eight years. The \"pass-through\" businesses pipeline their income to owners and other individuals, who then pay personal income tax on those earnings, not the corporate rate. They are allowed under the new law to deduct 20 percent of the first $315,000 of their earnings. Also until 2026, the tax law ended the $4,050 personal exemption for individuals, and capped at $10,000 the amount of property taxes or state or local taxes that consumers can deduct on their federal returns. Early this year, millions of working Americans got a boost from the tax law as they saw increases in their paychecks with less tax withheld by employers. But as Trump's populist attacks against free trade have erupted into trade wars with China and U.S. allies, trade tensions have overshadowed the tax cuts in economically vulnerable areas of the country that depend on exports. With retaliation coming against U.S.-made products such as blue jeans, motorcycles and whiskey, many of the hardest-hit states are those that were won by Trump in the 2016 election. Some in the business community have warned that the positive impact on the economy from the tax cuts could be eroded by harm inflicted by trade disputes. The solid Republican majority in the House nearly ensures passage of the new proposals before the November elections. But prospects in the Senate are clouded by the slim GOP majority and less appetite for tax cuts, given that a smaller proportion of members are facing re-election this year. Numerous senators are also concerned about the potential for blowing up the deficit with new tax cuts \u2014 absent corresponding new revenue sources. \"They'll see what comes out\" of the House, Gerson said.",

Bloomberg donated the money to his super PAC, Independence USA. First elected in 2001, Bloomberg served as mayor as a Republican before becoming an independent. He registered with the Democratic Party this month and is considered to be a potential presidential contender. He vowed to spend at least $80 million on the midterms in June. Independence USA produced its first national ad for $7 million, which will air throughout the country until the election. The remaining $3 million will go to digital advertising. The national ad argues that Republicans have hurt the middle class with their control of both houses of Congress. \"In Washington, one party is calling the shots, and the middle class isn't being heard,\" the ad says in a voiceover that plays over images of a diverse cast of Americans. \"We need a new Congress that will cut taxes for the middle class, ensure coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, and protect Social Security and Medicare.\" \"Vote for a Democratic candidate for an economy that works for everyone,\" the ad concludes. Bloomberg and Independence USA support candidates who emphasize gun laws, the environment and education. The former mayor is also the founder of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit group that advocates for gun control and is largely financed by Bloomberg.

            "article_content": "Facebook's high-profile security chief Alex Stamos announced Wednesday that he's leaving the company for a research and teaching role at Stanford University. Stamos has played a critical role in Facebook's response to 2016 U.S. presidential election meddling on its platform. \"I have been proud to work with some of the most skilled and dedicated security professionals in the world in one of the most difficult threat environments faced by any technology company,\" Stamos wrote in a Facebook post\u00a0announcing his departure. Stamos, who has worked at Facebook since 2015, will depart August 17. Just yesterday, he fielded questions from reporters on a conference call after\u00a0Facebook announced it shut down fake accounts\u00a0that aimed to influence the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. In his Facebook post, he touched on how the social network has responded to \"advanced adversaries.\" \"We have worked together to build new protections around user data, improve the security of products used by billions, roll out innovative encryption and privacy protections at unprecedented scale, and study and react to new classes of abuse by the world's most advanced adversaries,\" Stamos wrote. The New York Times reported in March that Stamos planned to leave the company this month and that his day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others in December. The Times reported that Facebook does not plan to appoint a successor for chief security officer. The paper also reported that Stamos advocated Facebook disclose more about Russian election interference in 2017, but met with resistance from colleagues. On Wednesday, Facebook chief operating officer\u00a0Sheryl Sandberg praised Stamos' contributions to security at Facebook,\u00a0CNET reports. \"Alex has played an important role in how we approach security challenges and helped us build relationships with partners so we can better address the threats we face,\" she said in a statement. \"We know he will be an enormous asset to the team at Stanford and we look forward to collaborating with him in his new role.\" At Stanford, Stamos says he will join the Freeman-Spogli Institute for International Studies as an adjunct professor and will contribute teaching for a new master's specialty in cybersecurity. He says he will also continue his work on understanding and preventing the misuse of technology as a Cyber Initiative Fellow, a William J. Perry Fellow in International Security and a Visiting Scholar at the Hoover Institution. CNET reports that Stamos started at Facebook after spending a year as Yahoo's chief information security officer. It was in these positions that he sometimes challenged company executives on privacy and security issues. The Associated Press reports that Facebook is bringing on thousands of human moderators and advanced artificial intelligence systems in an attempt to weed out fake accounts and foreign propaganda campaigns ahead of the midterm elections. However, security experts say bad actors are doing a better job hiding their tracks and have become more adept at camouflaging themselves from detection.

            "article_content": "A small street festival outside Miami features booths adorned with Puerto Rican flags. A band plays salsa music as vendors offer specialties from the Caribbean island such as rice with pork and chickpeas. There's also a woman working her way through the crowd with a clipboard, her white T-shirt emblazoned with the words \"Your vote, your voice, your future.\" She's searching for people like Shaimir Berrios, a 28-year-old who recently relocated to South Florida from Puerto Rico but has not yet registered for the upcoming U.S. elections. That makes her a prized commodity in what is expected to be a midterm election season with many close races. Berrios, selling natural soaps from one of the booths, moved to Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and she's eager to vote for the first time in a mainland election to show her anger over what she views as a tepid response by the U.S. federal government to the Sept. 20 storm that devastated the island. \"People have to look for change because it affects us. We have to get involved,\" she said, filling out the paperwork to register on a recent Sunday. The intensity of political attention is new for Puerto Ricans, who are accustomed to not having much political clout. While they are U.S. citizens, they cannot vote in the presidential election while on the island, which is a territory not a state. Their single representative in the House of Representatives has only limited voting power and they have no senators. But their votes have the same weight as other Americans when they move to the mainland, as hundreds of thousands have done over the past decade, first because of a deep economic recession and then because of Hurricane Maria. Political operatives, pollsters and politicians in at least four states are working hard to find people like Berrios, Puerto Ricans who are eligible to vote and whose party affiliation may be up for grabs. The efforts are particularly aggressive in Florida, where tens of thousands of people from the island relocated after the hurricane, but political types are also busy in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut. In Florida, where Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by only about 1 percentage point and Hispanic turnout was lower than expected, the votes of Puerto Ricans are potentially valuable in upcoming congressional and statewide races, said Susan McManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa. \"The bottom line is that mobilizing and getting out the vote of the Puerto Ricans is going to be critical,\" she said. At least 450,000 Puerto Ricans moved to the U.S. mainland over the past decade, causing the island's population to drop for the first time in modern history. It now has about 3.4 million people. How many have permanently relocated because of Hurricane Maria is not yet known, but estimates range from 115,000 to 200,000. There are now about 5.3 million Puerto Ricans on the U.S. mainland and they are concentrated in the Northeast and Florida. The recent street festival in the Miami suburb of Kendall is just one of many get-out-the-vote efforts aimed at Puerto Ricans. Organizers of the event said they are not affiliated with any party and voter registration was conducted by volunteers with the non-partisan League of Women Voters. \"We are just working so the Puerto Rican community can have its voice heard,\" the volunteer, Marisol Zenteno, said as she took a break from working a line of people waiting to buy pork and rice. \"They have the right when they come here to vote.\" But others are overtly partisan efforts. The Republican Party has hired three people to take charge of reaching out to displaced Puerto Ricans and to defend the Trump administration's response to the disaster and remind voters of the more than $20 billion in aid. \"It's an important vote for us,\" said Yali Nunez, a Republican National Committee spokeswoman. The Democratic Party is registering Puerto Ricans, especially in Florida, and has a \"voter education program\" aimed at helping people who fled Maria and at winning their vote, spokesman Francisco Pelayo said. The Latino Victory Fund, a nationwide Hispanic outreach effort co-founded by actress Eva Longoria, is also working to mobilize people who fled the island. A conservative effort is combining education and politics. The LIBRE Institute, which is funded by the billionaire activist Koch brothers, offers \"Welcome to Florida\" classes aimed at newly arrived Puerto Ricans. They teach English and job-hunting skills, concluding with a pitch for what Cesar Grajales describes as \"free-market\" principles. \"We don't talk about candidates, but we do talk about public policies,\" said Grajales, who is director of coalitions at the LIBRE Initiative, a parent organization. Around 80 people were attending three separate classes on a recent evening near Orlando, part of the Central Florida region where a majority of the Puerto Ricans in the state have settled. Dinette Rivera, one of the students, came to the mainland days after the hurricane knocked out power and water to most of Puerto Rico but she says hasn't found full-time work as a nurse yet because her English isn't fluent. The 33-year-old, who came with her husband and two children from the southeastern coastal town of Maunabo, said she has already registered as an independent and is eager to vote. \"We can choose someone who can help us,\" she said outside the class in an office park. The people in the classrooms are also being targeted by the main candidates for the U.S. Senate in Florida: Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Both have campaigned in the Orlando area and visited Puerto Rico. Scott has gone to the island five times since the storm. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, who held a campaign-style rally of his own outside Orlando, has urged people from the island who are on the mainland to get involved in local congressional races in states such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Florida to support candidates who have been responsive to the needs of the island and to punish those who have not. \"The call is to every Puerto Rican to be electorally active in the United States,\" Rossello said while announcing an initiative to mobilize Puerto Rican voters. At the street festival in Kendall, one newly registered voter said she was preparing to do just that. Aida Merced Lopez, a 74-year-old retiree, said she was looking forward to being able to punish President Trump, who angered many on the island by tossing paper towels to storm survivors in what some felt was a disrespectful way and quarreling publicly with the mayor of San Juan. \"It would be great if Puerto Rico could vote. If we could then maybe that guy wouldn't be here,\" Lopez said of the president.",

            "article_content": "Mother Jones is not just a magazine, friends. An epic figure long revered in the labor movement, Mary G. Harris Jones helped lead a people-powered uprising that established workplace rights for mine workers and shined a light on the horrors of child labor in the United States in the early 1900s. At a time when women had not yet won the right to vote, she marched her \"Children's Crusade\" right to the doorstep of President Theodore Roosevelt and leveraged the media to build public support for the workers. Though Mother Jones lived and fought a century ago, her mission and the stakes of that battle could not be more relevant than they are today. When the Supreme Court ruled against labor unions in Janus v. AFSCME late last month, the 5-4 decision was heralded by conservatives and lamented by progressives who are set to suffer the consequences for the foreseeable electoral future. Immediately, the Supreme Court's decision to prohibit unions from collecting \"fair share\" dues from nonunion workers \u2013 who benefit from bargaining agreements negotiated on behalf of all public sector employees regardless of their union membership status \u2013 will mean mean millions of dollars in lost dues for the labor movement.\u00a0 New York and California have already announced the end of automatic dues collections in their states. While that means less money for labor unions like the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the National Education Association (NEA), and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) to continue to push for good-paying jobs with benefits for teachers and other public employees, it will ultimately mean substantially less money for these unions to impact the political arena as well, assuming an exodus of union members follows the ruling. That is bad news for Democrats and progressive organizations whose campaigns and operations depend in large part on reliable labor dollars and an engaged union membership to support their work. The 2016 electoral cycle saw unions spend more money to support Democratic candidates than ever before, with their combined financial contributions amounting to\u00a0more than $167 million. That sum is far from enough to outstrip conservatives, whose PACs and most wealthy individual donors regularly outspend unions every election. But coupled with the ability to recruit and deploy armies of union member volunteers to hit the phones and knock doors in high DPI neighborhoods, union dollars have been a key part of Democratic progress for more than a generation. Truth be told, unions were dying long before the Janus decision. When I began working in the labor movement nearly 20 years ago, I was thrilled and proud to don the ubiquitous purple of SEIU. I felt the power of working people standing together to demand more from the most privileged in America, and I drew energy from the strikes and marches and bargaining meetings I witnessed. While the labor unions of today are a far cry from two decades ago \u2014 in good ways and in bad ones \u2014 the union experience I had then masked what was already a movement in decline.\u00a0 Union density among all U.S. workers was at just\u00a013.5 percent\u00a0at the start of the millennium, with union membership significantly higher for public sector employees \u2013 4 in 10 compared with less than 1 in 10 for the private sector. The process for union elections mandated by the 1948 National Labor Relations Act hurt union organizing drives about as much as it helped, with \"management consultants\" regularly gaming the system and spreading misinformation to sway worker votes. Meanwhile, the downward spiral in job quality, benefits, and workplace protections coinciding with the decrease in manufacturing jobs was also reverberating across other industries powered by working people. These trends have continued in recent years, with overall union density down to\u00a010.5 percent\u00a0and closer to 3 in 10 public sector workers in unions in 2017 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the Janus decision, labor is now in free fall. There is another way. The plight of working people has not been more dire in decades \u2014 nor has there ever been more jockeying by candidates on both sides of the aisle to be labeled champion of the working class. In the midst of despair, unions now have a real chance to reconnect with the working people. The recent social media push among labor organizers to demonstrate support for unions with a placard and photo marked\u00a0#Union\u00a0is a start. But in the wake of Janus, labor really needs to go all in. We have seen the fury that progressives can assemble when it's clear what's under attack \u2014 whether that's women's rights, the sanctity of science, the plight of immigrants seeking asylum, our schoolchildren facing down guns. It's up to unions now \u2014 with the declining resources they have left \u2014 to remind America what happened before they were the shield of the working man and woman and child, and what is likely to happen should they disappear altogether. It's time for a message campaign \u2014 a massive rebranding effort, really. And it's time for the 14.8 million union members left in the U.S. to take their message and their fight to the streets.\u00a0 There's reason for labor unions to be hopeful. More than half of Americans now view labor unions positively according to an April survey by the\u00a0Pew Research Center\u00a0\u2013 fully 55 percent compared to 41 percent in 2011. Gallup polling has similarly shown a steady rise in public opinion about labor unions in recent years, from 48 percent in 2009 to 61 percent in 2017. This shift in perception may be due to the recent teachers' protests in places like Oklahoma and West Virginia, where people saw union members advocating for higher quality education and basic classroom needs. But it's also probably a reflection of the general feeling that working people are continuing to lose in a system that has been rigged against them. It's critical that labor defines the stakes and makes the connection for the people who need and benefit from unions most \u2013 so they can be engaged in the fight to defend them. Unions ended child labor in America and helped establish the minimum wage. They fought for and won a 40-hour workweek for everyone. They created workplace safety standards. But they're not done yet. Income inequality continues to grow, and that hard-fought federal minimum wage hasn't been raised in nine years -- it stands at $7.25 an hour, less than half of a living wage of $15 an hour.\u00a0 Hashtag that.

Joe Crowley in June. The 30-year-old state representative is proud member of the Democratic Socialists of America.\u00a0 But it's unclear if the outpouring of national support will help him win a six-way race in Hawaii's primary elections on Sunday. The day after she won her primary election, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her support for Ing. \"He is incredibly inspiring \u2013 another working class American who knocked on 15,000 doors to win his state assembly seat,\" she wrote. \"Now he's running for Congress. Imagine what we could accomplish if we both went in tomorrow.\" America: Please send @KanielaIng to Congress with me!He is incredibly inspiring - another working class American who knocked on 15,000 doors to win his state assembly seat.Now he\u2019s running for Congress.

It is easy to draw parallels between Ing's campaign and that of Ocasio-Cortez. A campaign ad for Ing released in July was produced by the same company that created Ocasio-Cortez's viral campaign video. He released another campaign spot on Wednesday which showed him strumming a ukulele while saying that \"Hawaiian values\" are Democratic Socialist values. \"When we talk about policies like Medicare for All, universal health care, housing for all, public education through college, canceling student debt - these are just policies that would make everyday, working people's lives dignified,\" Ing said in the ad. \"All this stuff is possible, we just cannot lose hope, and we've got to come out and vote.\" \u201cWhat dreams would you pursue if your basic needs were met?\u201d Our message is mainstream; it just makes sense. Hawaiian values are @DemSocialists values. pic.twitter.com/FyUaBodmcx While he may benefit from low voter turnout, which some believe Ocasio-Cortez did, he faces five primary opponents, unlike Ocasio-Cortez, who faced one.\u00a0 Ing is facing big names such as former Rep. Ed Case, current Lt. Gov. Doug Chin, and state Sen. Donna Mercado Kim in the race for the seat soon to be vacated by Rep. Colleen Hanabusa. Ed Case, current Lt. Gov. Doug Chin, and state Sen. Donna Mercado Kim. Case, a former member of the conservative Blue Dog Democrats caucus while in Congress, and has argued that the district is too conservative to accept some radical progressive policies. Chin, who is also the former state attorney general, and Kim both have strong establishment credentials as longtime figures in Hawaii politics. Further, Ing isn't the only progressive option for voters. State Rep. Beth Fukumoto, a Republican until the election of Mr. Trump inspired her to switch parties in 2017, supports abolishing U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and creating a single-payer health care system, like Ing. Ing trails behind Case, Chin, and Kim in a poll taken in mid-July.\u00a0 Despite Ocasico-Cortez's shot to stardom after her win,\u00a0candidates endorsed by her\u00a0have a mixed success rate this election cycle. Cori Bush lost her primary bid against Rep. William Lacy Clay in Missouri, and Abdul El-Sayed was easily defeated by Gretchen Whitmer in the Democratic primary for governor in Michigan. However, Ocasio-Cortez-supported congressional candidates Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and James Thompson in Kansas won their primaries on Tuesday night.

            "article_content": "Americans may talk more about democracy than exercising it. In the 2014 midterms, only a third of U.S. voters bothered to cast ballots -- the lowest turnout for a national election in the developed world since 1945.\u00a0 But a growing number of U.S. companies are moving to change that by making it easier for people to vote. CEOs from companies including Patagonia, Levi Strauss, PayPal, Kaiser Permanente, Tyson Foods and Walmart recently issued a joint\u00a0statement\u00a0saying they are looking for ways to increase voter turnout, starting with the midterms.\u00a0Citing\u00a0research showing that work and family demands are a major impediment to hitting the ballot box, executives said they want to \"change the paradigm.\" Some businesses have already taken action. On election day in 2016, Patagonia closed all of its retail stores across the country, a distribution and customer service center in Nevada, and its California headquarters to give its employees time off -- paid -- to vote.\u00a0 With the outdoor gear company doing the same this November, CEO Rose Marcario is urging other companies to follow suit. \"No American should have to choose between a paycheck and fulfilling his or her duty as a citizen,\" said said in a\u00a0statement. For most companies, the commitment to enabling workers to vote stops short of turning Nov. 6 into a paid holiday, as Patagonia does. But some, such as Levi Strauss, are giving their workers paid time off to vote, an idea that's also getting play in academic circles. In a\u00a0petition\u00a0started by two Stanford University political science professors, they and hundreds of their colleagues call on companies including Walmart, Amazon, Starbucks, Home Depot, Lowe's, McDonald's and Target to give workers paid time off to vote. They also called on colleges and universities to cancel classes on election day. Walmart said it was supporting the effort primarily by providing voting information, including how to register and polling locations, to its workers and customers.\u00a0 \"In terms of our associates, we believe it's important that everyone has an opportunity to vote, and we have policies in place to ensure they have that opportunity,\" said a Walmart spokesperson in an email. At a time companies are more openly staking out positions on a range of issues, from climate change to the minimum wage, others are stepping further into the political fray.\u00a0 Levi Strauss' voter push\u00a0included an alliance with the nonprofit organization Rock the Vote. Separately, the retailer has pledged more than $1 million to nonprofits and youth activists working to end deadly shootings in the U.S. And Patagonia is publicly endorsing candidates for the first time, backing two Democrats for Senate, Jacky Rosen in Nevada and Jon Tester in Montana, citing \"unprecedented threats to our public lands and waters.\"",

            "article_content": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made clear almost two weeks ago that he would vote against a bill that eases some of the Dodd-Frank regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. He also made clear he wouldn't try to stop it. As more than a dozen Democratic senators helped Republicans chip away at the Obama-era banking law Wednesday, Schumer largely stepped aside, rather than twist arms. It was a do-what-you-must strategy aimed at allowing some moderate Democratic senators to avoid the wrath of powerful banking interests back home. But it also split the party and, some argued, muddied the party's populist message against President Donald Trump ahead of the midterm election. For Schumer it was a crucial test of how he intends to shepherd a deeply divided group of Democrats through a difficult campaign year, and beyond. While some of his predecessors might have blocked the vote or tried to hold troops in line, Schumer, a New Yorker unafraid of noisy disagreements, was comfortable with some fights within the family. \"When half of our caucus sides with Republicans and the banks, it's impossible to rise above the din and show that we're on the side of the working class,\" said Brian Fallon, a former top Schumer aide who later advised Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. \"You can't blame leader Schumer for not wanting to twist the arms of red-state Democrats against home-state banking interests,\" Fallon said, \"but from the standpoint of the larger party messaging, it's a missed opportunity to not strike a bright-line contrast on behalf of consumers.\" The Senate approved the bill Wednesday 67-31. Schumer put the party on this path last fall when he agreed to allow four Democratic senators \u2014 almost all of them up for re-election in states Trump won \u2014 to work with Senate Banking Committee Republicans on legislation to ease regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. Initial talks between Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the panel's chairman, and its top Democrat, Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, broke down as Democrats said the changes went too far. But within a month of gaining Schumer's nod, the Democratic senators \u2014 Jon Tester of Montana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Mark Warner of Virginia \u2014 struck a deal with Republicans. Their compromise sailed through the committee. Moderates say the changes they have been seeking for years are needed to help small and mid-size banks, particularly in rural regions, that can't afford to keep up with the regulations. But liberals argue it goes too far in lifting requirements on bigger banks that received federal bailout funds. Seizing the opening for a legislative victory \u2014 and a bipartisan bill that divides Democrats \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved it swiftly to the floor. Schumer, GOP aides said, was getting rolled. The left flank hammered Democrats for cozying up to bankers \u2014 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren named names of fellow Democratic senators in an email blast. But even if the Warren wing tried to filibuster, the GOP majority \u2014 with the support of Democrats \u2014 had more than the 60 votes needed to overcome a blockade. About the only option left was the war of words. And it has been explosive. \"This bill wouldn't be on the path to becoming law without the support of these Democrats,\" Warren chided colleagues in a tweet. \"Calling out members of my own party who are supporting the #BankLobbyistAct doesn't make me the most popular kid on the team. But that's not why I ran for the Senate,\" she said in another. Heitkamp shot back Monday that she didn't come to the Senate to \"worry about whether we were keeping the caucus together.\" \"I came here to represent North Dakota, and that's exactly what I'm doing,\" she told The Associated Press, adding that her local bankers say they'll be able to do more lending if the bill is passed. \"It really will make a huge difference for rural America.\" Schumer has mostly stood by as tensions flared. At a recent closed-door luncheon, moderate senators \u2014 they were taken aback by the directness of the attacks \u2014 told Warren she needs to stop. Schumer did tell Warren to focus her opposition on the substance of the bill, rather than its supporters, according to a person familiar with the exchange. Warren responded that working on these issues was why she ran for the Senate, according to another person familiar with the conversation. Both people requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private conversation publicly. But Schumer has largely let the caucus handle those disagreements among themselves, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the issues who was not authorized to discuss the private session publicly and requested anonymity. Senators, the aide said, don't want him to micro-manage. Schumer rose to become party leader after helping Democrats win tough elections in states now dominated by Trump voters when he was chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee more than a decade ago. At the time, Wall Street money flowed to Democrats as well as Republicans. Part of his appeal in taking over for retiring Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., after the 2016 election was a promise to stitch together the party's liberal and conservative wings, bringing Warren and moderate Democrats into caucus leadership positions. Schumer has kept them together more than many expected, especially as 10 Democratic senators run for re-election from Trump-won states. Senate Democrats held the line against GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and put up a fight against the president's nominees. All voted against the GOP tax plan. Where Reid might have halted the banking bill by pushing more Democrats to oppose it \u2014 a strategy that often prevented infighting but left some senators frustrated with inaction \u2014 Schumer decided to let the process play out. The outcome this week, though messy, could allow all sides to claim wins. Liberals take a populist stand that revs up the base and moderates strike a bipartisan compromise for their home-states. \"He's dealing with this little internecine war as good as could be expected,\" said Jim Manley, a former top Reid aide. \"That's an integral part of the playbook. Sometimes a good leader knows there are different ways for members to claim victory.\"",

But who gets to take credit for that? As Americans headed to the polls Tuesday, CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told \"CBS This Morning\" it's important to remember \"economic cycles are long.\" She also warned that the \"sugar high\" the U.S. economy is experiencing this year may not last into 2019. \u00a0\u00a0 \"This current upturn started back in June of 2009\u2026and from 2009 'til about 2017, through those years, we've seen growth at about, let's say 2.25 sometimes it popped up to 2.5 percent \u2013 tepid growth,\" Schlesinger said. \u00a0 This year, the economy is on track for 3 percent growth, which would be the best growth since 2005. \u00a0But that growth, Schlesinger said, comes at a cost with the 2018 deficit up 17 percent from 2017.  \"We saw a lot of spending by the government, the deficit has widened, and frankly, that could actually be a problem next year because if the deficit is up pretty high and we are having problems with tariffs, we could see growth cool next year. So economists are telling me 3 percent growth would be great this year. That sugar high may not last into 2019,\" Schlesinger said.  Ahead of the midterms, Democrats argued that the 2017 tax law that cut taxes for corporations and wealthy Americans and provided smaller tax cuts for middle and low-income people and families props up the seemingly robust economy. President Trump also promised an additional tax cut for middle-class Americans in the lead up to Election Day but has yet to offer many details on that.  Still, job growth has continued to hold steady with an average of 211,000 jobs added each month in 2018. U.S. businesses added a whopping 250,000 jobs in October, a number that surpassed Wall Street expectations. \u00a0 \"I think this far into a recovery the job situation is really terrific, right. We know that job growth accelerates early in a recovery but to have more than 200,000 jobs a month, every single month in 2018, is a really good number. Unemployment, it's down to a 49-year low, 3.7%. And also good news on wages which have just started to accelerate, up by just over 3 percent from a year ago.\"",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden headlined a get-out-the-vote rally with Democratic candidates in Orlando, Florida, on Tuesday afternoon. Biden has been campaigning for Democratic candidates across the country in the run-up to the midterm election, appearing in Indiana earlier this month to campaign for Sen. Joe Donnelly, and in Nevada over the weekend to stump for Democratic Senate candidate Jacky Rosen. He is currently completing a campaign swing through Florida, appearing at another rally in at the University of South Florida in Tampa on Monday, where he rallied with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. At that rally, he said that this year's election is \"bigger than politics.\" \"Get the hell up and take back the country. It is about who we are. It is about dreaming again,\" Biden said, encouraging Floridians to vote. Both Gillum and Nelson are in tight races. Biden rallied with Nelson, Rep. Stephanie Murphy and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer on Tuesday. His speech repeated lines from previous rallies, such as the assurance that this election is \"bigger than politics,\" and that \"we're in a battle for the soul of America.\" He also expanded on the difference between Democrats and Republicans in this election, particularly focusing on President Trump's tendency to cosy up to autocrats such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un. The crowd in attendance shouted that Mr. Trump was a \"traitor.\" \"America already knows who Donald Trump is. The question is, who are we?\" Biden said, presenting the election as an opportunity to make America a global leader again and restore the middle class -- similar arguments to what Mr. Trump makes at his own rallies. Biden said that he is a Democrat because he \"cannot stand the abuse of power.\" \"this president is more like George Wallace than George Washington,\" Biden said, referring to the Southern governor and segregation advocate, and alluding to Mr. Trump's racially charged rhetoric around the election. \"Democrats have to choose hope over fear.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The acting head of the IRS says the current tax-filing season has gone well, while acknowledging the tough challenge the cash-strapped agency faces of administering the new tax law that will affect 2019 returns. Acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter told Congress Thursday that some 79 million refunds totaling about $226 billion have been issued as of April 6, averaging $2,900 \u2014 up $13 from last year. Around 80 percent of returns filed claimed a refund. The agency's so-called level of service for taxpayers calling for information is running close to 80 percent. That's the number of toll-free callers who either talk to an IRS customer service rep or receive automated messages with tax information, divided by the total number of attempted calls. The final year under the \"old\" tax regime, 2017, has to be accounted for by taxpayers in returns by Tuesday. The agency, pummeled for years by criticism from congressional Republicans and funding cuts, now must administer and enforce the most sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code in three decades. Kautter told the Senate Finance Committee that the new law \"requires extensive work by the IRS this year and next.\" The paperwork alone is immense: about 450 forms and instructions will have to be amended. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the panel's chairman, said the new burden falls on an agency with a history of mismanagement and taxpayer abuse that is laboring under funding and technology deficits. \"On the one hand, the IRS has made marked improvements in recent years,\" Hatch said. \"But, on the other hand, it is an agency stuck in the past. It relies on software and core processing systems designed during the Kennedy administration. IRS employees routinely have to manually input return information into agency computers, and often require taxpayers to send information via fax machine.\" The massive Republican tax-cut legislation was muscled through Congress late last year and now stands as President Donald Trump's marquee achievement. It took effect Jan. 1, billed as a huge boon for the stressed middle class and a key GOP selling point in the midterm elections this year. The $1.5 trillion package provides generous tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, and more modest reductions for middle- and low-income individuals and families. The tax cuts for corporations are permanent, while those for individuals and families expire in 2026. Nonpartisan tax experts project that the law will bring lower taxes for the great majority of Americans, though not all. Already taxpayers have seen a tangible result of the new tax law. Millions of working Americans saw bigger paychecks starting early in the year. Companies and payroll service providers \u2014 and their computer systems \u2014 had to adjust to new withholding tables crafted by the IRS to reflect changes in tax rates for different income levels under the new law. The tax bill or refunds for the changes won't come in until 2019. For this filing season, \"I haven't heard about any disasters,\" says Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban Institute. And he gives the IRS credit for doing a good job this season of keeping up with scams. Still, the numbers that really count are the IRS budget figures. After years of Congress' cuts, \"The IRS doesn't have remotely enough money to do what it needs to do,\" Gleckman said. \"There's going to be huge challenges out there.\" During President Barack Obama's tenure, Republicans controlling the congressional purse strings accused the IRS of liberal bias and unfair targeting of conservative tax-exempt groups. This year, with the new tax law looming, Congress was more willing to open its wallet for the IRS and rejected to an extent the Trump administration's proposed cuts. But it ended up cutting in other areas, with the result that the agency budget is about the same \u2014 $11.5 billion \u2014 as in recent years. Kautter is doing double duty as the assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy. He is the acting head of the IRS. Trump has nominated as its new permanent chief Charles Rettig, a tax lawyer who has represented thousands of individuals and companies in civil and criminal tax matters before the agency. Rettig must be confirmed by the Senate. The House tax-writing committee, meanwhile, approved a series of bipartisan bills Wednesday aimed at changing the way the IRS operates. They would, for example, create an independent appeals process to help taxpayers resolve disputes with the agency, bolster programs that provide tax assistance to low-income, elderly, disabled people and immigrants, and crack down on fraud by tax preparer businesses that prey on unwary people. The agency would have to submit a plan for revamping its customer service strategy. The Ways and Means panel dispatched the legislation to the full House for a vote.",

            "article_content": "Some of the strongest opposition within the Republican party last year in the debate over the 2017 tax cut legislation flared up from lawmakers worried about a lower cap on deductions for state and local taxes. Now Republicans in these high-tax states who voted for the tax cuts are being skewered by their Democratic challengers targeting them over their support for President Trump's tax cuts. Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California faced a conundrum over the GOP tax cut with the $10,000 state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. Voting for the legislation would result in higher taxes for many of their constituents, and voting against it would mean bucking the party. With somber piano music in the background, Democratic House candidate Dana Balter, running in New York, claims in one of her two tax ads, \"The new tax law is hurting people\" and \"most of us will pay higher taxes\" as a result. Balter is running against Rep. John Katko, R-New York, who supported the tax cuts. His campaign spokesman said in a statement to CBS News Balter was \"spreading misinformation\" about the tax bill. Katko is firing back with\u00a0his own ads insisting Balter would be the one to raise taxes in order to pay for Medicare-for-All.\u00a0 Last week Balter's tax message was amplified when the House Majority PAC, which supports Democratic candidates,\u00a0 announced a $1 million ad buy spotlighting the state and local tax deduction cap. \"They depended on that deduction but Congressman Katko voted to take it away,\" the ad declares. David Harris, an accounting professor at the Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University, told CBS News the SALT cap is a \"perfect storm\" issue for local politicians.  \"It makes great political pressure...as it sounds like everybody is going to suffer,\" Harris said, though he noted that most New York residents won't in fact suffer, since most average New Yorkers use the standard tax deduction and therefore are unaffected by the SALT cap change.  CBS News currently rates this race and 13 others in California, New York and New Jersey as competitive.  Democrats across the country are also seizing on the issue. \"You know you can't defend the actual record that you voted for in Congress because you know it's unpopular,\" Democratic House candidate Josh Harder said last month in a debate against Rep. Jeff Denham, R-California, \"You call it a tax cut, it raised taxes in California.\" \u00a0\u00a0 Harder jabbed at Denham with the California Franchise Tax Board's finding that the 2017 tax plan could raise individual taxes on one million mostly-wealthy Californians next year by $12 billion dollars.\u00a0 \"I'm proud of the tax cuts, and we need to do more of it,\" Denham responded in the debate.\u00a0 \"Talk to people in our community that see in their paycheck, look at it every month on how your paycheck is changed,\" Denham shot back. \"That's a big deal in our community.\" The SALT cap was a \"dirty compromise\" last year for Republicans in an effort to diminish the deficit during their \"once-in-a-generation opportunity for major tax reform,\" Graeme Boushey, associate professor of political science at University of California at Irvine, told CBS News.  Boushey said this was a \"very hard vote\" for congressional members in wealthy districts, like Rep. Mimi Walters, R-California, who felt pressure to support this GOP promise.  Democrat Katie Porter, who is challenging Walters to represent the wealthy suburban district, tries to squeeze the congresswoman for voting along with her party. Porter told CNBC in a September digital debate, \"...other Republicans in Orange County in Congress...all voted \"no\" on Trump's tax plan because they knew it punished California families and would create a financial shock at people's pocketbooks in 2019.\"\u00a0 Porter overstated the number of California Republicans who voted against the tax plan, but it's true that 12 Republicans voted against the tax cuts and two were from Walters' neighboring districts.  Walters told CNBC, \"Ninety percent of Americans are going to see a benefit from this tax reform package.\" Walters added she believed \"the lower income people will definitely see a positive effect on this, middle class as well,\" because of the change that allows the first $12,000 in income to be tax-free.  CBS News classifies both Walters' and Denham's races as \"competitive\" this year.  The new tax plan also prompted four Democrat governors -- including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy --\u00a0to sue the federal government this summer, arguing the new state and local tax deduction limit is an \"unconstitutional assault\" which will \"disproportionately\" harm their states.\u00a0 First-term Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-New York, cut-down this effort and told WUTQ on October 3, \"The reason Governor Cuomo, who has teamed up with my opponent on just about everything, is suing the federal government is he is worried that wealthy people aren't going to get their lifeline.\" \u00a0 CBS News ranks her race as competitive this year as she defends her tax cuts vote and says \"95 percent\" of low-to middle-income individuals in her district will receive the tax cut.  \"You know who is not?\" Tenney told WUTQ, \"The wealthiest people around us. And trust me, they're complaining.\" And in New Jersey, Democrat Andy Kim is challenging Rep. Tom MacArthur and called the tax plan a \"disaster\" during a candidate forum this summer, according to the AP. \u00a0 MacArthur was the only Republican from the state to vote in favor of the tax cuts and told the New York Times last year the problem was not his federal tax cuts vote but how taxes are controlled in New Jersey's state capital.  \"If cutting taxes at the federal level forces Democrats in Trenton to do the same, then this would be a welcome new direction for the state and an even bigger win for New Jersey taxpayers,\" MacArthur said.\u00a0 These GOP incumbents are in line with party leaders who are trying to frame tax cuts as a marquee message for the midterms. \u00a0 \"We want to make tax cuts for individuals and families permanent. [Democrats] want to repeal tax reform\u2014and raise taxes on hardworking Americans,\" Speaker Paul Ryan said last Monday in a \"Better Off Now\" speech. \u00a0  In an effort to do this the House last month passed along party lines \"Tax Cuts 2.0\" in part to make the tax cuts permanent. The Senate has yet to vote on this legislation.\u00a0 Last December, CBS News polling found that independents, almost by a 2-to-1 margin, believed their taxes would go up under the new plan. A survey commissioned by the RNC last month, first reported by Bloomberg, found Republicans \"lost the messaging battle\" on the tax cuts.\u00a0 The nine Republicans who voted against the tax cut plan and are now running for re-election are trying to tiptoe by their past critiques of the tax plan without adding to relentless messaging from Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democrats who call this a \"Republican tax scam\" that benefits corporations and the wealthiest Americans.  Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-New York, voted against the tax cuts and predicted last December that if the cap was implemented it could \"lead to more families leaving\" her upper-New York region.",

            "article_content": "President Trump has filed an extension for his 2017 taxes, the White House said on Tuesday, citing the complicated nature of Mr. Trump's return situation. Tuesday is the deadline for filing 2017 tax returns. \"The president filed an extension for his 2017 tax return, as do many Americans with complex returns,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. \"He will file his tax return by the extension deadline of Oct. 15, 2018.\" Mr. Trump's tax situation is complicated in part by his vast business empire \u2014 he declined to divest himself from those businesses, while his sons run them. The president has opted not to release his tax returns, breaking with the tradition of recent presidents and presidential candidates. The White House has said the president will not release his returns while they are under audit.\u00a0 The extension filing comes as Mr. Trump and Republicans have claimed that, thanks to the GOP-led tax overhaul, Americans next year will have an incredibly simple filing system. Outgoing Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and others expressed their hope that Americans would be able to file their returns on paper the size of a postcard.\u00a0 Mr. Trump tweeted about taxes multiple times Tuesday. Months after the GOP passed their tax overhaul, the president has continued to travel to tout the new plan and its benefits for the middle class, ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. On Monday, he promoted his tax plan in a small business roundtable.\u00a0 So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill. Everyone is talking, really nice to see! Employment is up, Taxes are DOWN. Enjoy! When two pages of Mr. Trump's 2005 returns were leaked last year, they revealed that Mr. Trump reported more than $150 million in income, and paid $38 million in federal income taxes. The White House confirmed those details. That's an effective tax rate of 25.3 percent. Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "You've heard of the wealth gap. And you probably know it's growing worldwide, including in the U.S., where the measure is now as wide as it is in Russia.  But did you know how wide? According to a recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research,\u00a0almost 40 percent of U.S. households have zero or negative wealth. That is, they don't have any assets at all, while the top 5 percent hold about half.\u00a0 Of course, Americans aren't alone. The recovery since the Great Recession shifted more than half -- 50.1 percent -- of all household wealth to the\u00a0top 1 percent of global citizens, up from 45.5 percent in 2000, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from investment bank Credit Suisse (CS). \u00a0 That should set off alarms for investors who aren't paying enough attention to the wealth gap as U.S. markets break record high after record high, real estate prices are still climbing and the country comes close to what economists call \"full employment,\" Deutsche Bank (DB) Chief International Economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k  argued in a presentation this month. \"For now, global growth is good and earnings are good and the tax reform will continue to boost stocks,\" said Sl\u00f8k. \"But over the medium term, we think investors are making a mistake if they don't take inequality into account as a game changer for the benign outlook the market has at the moment.\" The Deutsche Bank note comes as gaps between more than just the rich and everyone else are widening. The gulf between upper-income families and lower- and middle-income families are also\u00a0at the highest levels ever recorded, a recent Pew Research analysis found. In 2016, the median wealth of lower-income families was 42 percent less than in 2007. For middle-income families, it was 33 percent lower. Net worth for those groups, $10,800 and $110,1000 respectively, are comparable to 1989 levels, according to Pew.  Though lower- and middle-income families overall experienced some gains in the past decade, they aren't big enough to make up for the losses suffered during the recession, the study said.\u00a0 Wealth disparity levels like these were last seen in the Gilded Age, and they may worsen this year, wrote Greg Wright, assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Merced, on the academic website The Conversation. The tax legislation passed last month cut taxes \u00a0on capital and for \"high-earning individuals,\" while giving lower-income earners \"smaller, temporary cuts,\" he wrote. \"Meanwhile, the government has yet to renew federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, a program affecting 9 million poor families,\" Wright added. \"And the tax bill repealed the Affordable Care Act's individual insurance mandate, which may ultimately lead to a loss of coverage for millions of low- and middle-income Americans.\" How did the world get here? The wealth gap has been widening over decades. The top 0.1 percent of American earners, or those with $6 million in average income, saw income surge by 320 percent between 1980 to 2014, compared with just 42 percent for middle-income workers, according to research published last year by economists including Gabriel Zucman.\u00a0 That created a gulf in spending power between the richest Americans and the middle class, giving those at the top the buying power to spring for homes worth $1 million or more, Zucman argued.\u00a0 Technology is also playing a part in middle-income level jobs where artificial intelligence and automation are expanding: Wages in those jobs are slipping, a recent Glassdoor report found. Pay for loan officers fell 6.1 percent in December compared with a year earlier, while office manager pay sank 1.1 percent and machine operators lost 1.9 percent as automation takes root more widely in manufacturing. There's a racial component, too. For every $100 in wealth that white families accumulate, black families have built up about about $5, a September study from Yale researchers found.\u00a0 The sweeping U.S. tax law changes may keep markets and property values rising for now,\u00a0 but there are already signs political norms\u00a0might shift\u00a0as 2018 elections loom, some economists argue. It \"raises the risks that voters want significant change from how society is currently designed,\" Deutsche Bank's Sl\u00f8k said. \"This can both be a turn to the left or the right. But generally a turn away from the current system.\" And because the gap took decades to develop, the adjustments needed to correct aren't simple.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"There are no easy fixes,\" Sl\u00f8k said. \"Different politicians will have different answers to what the right solutions are. But given current global trends in inequality, I think investors are making a mistake if they don't take the populist consequences of inequality into account.\"",

            "article_content": "BOGOTA, Colombia --\u00a0The conservative protege of a powerful former president and a leftist former guerrilla who has galvanized voters with an anti-establishment message are headed for what promises to be a polarizing presidential runoff after gaining the most votes in Sunday's election. With almost all quick-count results in, former senator Ivan Duque was leading with 39 percent of the ballots cast, short of the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a June runoff.\u00a0 One-time rebel and ex-Bogota mayor Gustavo Petro trailed in second place with 25 percent, edging out former Medellin Mayor Sergio Fajardo, who garnered nearly 24 percent. Duque and Petro represent opposite ends of Colombia's political spectrum and have presented dramatically different visions for the future of the Andean nation as it moves forward with a historic peace process with leftist rebels. Duque is the handpicked candidate of Alvaro Uribe, the ex-president and chief critic of the nation's 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. He is promising to amend important aspects of the accord like ensuring that drug trafficking is not an amnestied crime and blocking guerrilla leaders from political office. Petro supports the accord and has galvanized youth voters angered by deeply entrenched corruption and income inequality. He is vowing to end Colombia's dependence on oil exports and raise taxes on vast swaths of unproductive land in hopes of boosting agricultural production. Critics have warned his rise could push Colombia dangerously toward the left and rattle markets. \"The result was a sharp blow to traditional politics,\" said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue. \"With a Duque/Petro runoff, Colombians will face a starker choice than in many years.\" The election has sparked fears on both the left and right, with Duque's critics cautioning that his presidency would be tantamount to a constitutionally barred third term for Uribe. Though hugely popular among Colombians for improving security and weakening illegal armed groups, Uribe also presided over grave human rights violations by the military. Meanwhile, Petro and his populist \"Humane Colombia\" platform have drawn comparisons from critics to the late Venezuelan socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who Petro once admired. He brought Chavez to Colombia in 1994 shortly after the Venezuelan paratrooper was released from jail, where he was sent for staging a military coup. \"I'm worried ... Populism is strengthening,\" Nicolas Goyeneche, 28-year-old student, told Reuters news agency.\"But in the second round, we'll beat populism.\" Petro describes himself as a \"strong adversary\" of the neighboring country's current president, Nicolas Maduro, but his early ties to Chavez have dogged him throughout the campaign. His campaign likened the comparisons to fear-mongering tactics by a traditional political class no longer able to court votes based on their hardline stance against leftist rebels. In a speech before hundreds of supporters Sunday night, Petro said fears that he would turn Colombia into an authoritarian state where wealth is redistributed are unfounded. He said his proposals instead amount to a \"democratization\" of opportunities so that more Colombians can benefit from education and join the middle class. \"The nearly 5 million votes we received today are the votes of the youth, of excluded sectors far and wide across Colombia who have decided to burst in and say, 'We are present,'\" he said. Supporters waved flags emblazoned with the Soviet Union's hammer and sickle and the logo of the disbanded M-19 rebel group that Petro belonged to in his youth. Edilia Pinzon, 55, was among those cheering on Petro. \"We are making history,\" said Pinzon, a street merchant. \"The others who have reached power haven't fulfilled their promises, especially to those of us with few means.\" More than 19 million voters cast ballots in the election, the highest turnout in two decades. The results were especially harsh for Fajardo, who fell less than 2 points behind Petro and failed to advance to the next round. During weeks of negotiations he tried unsuccessfully to form an alliance with like-minded centrist Humberto de la Calle, whose 2 percent vote haul would've been enough to push Fajardo past Petro. Fajardo conceded defeat but showed no sign of who he'll support in a runoff where his 4.5 million supporters are likely to be decisive. Petro and Duque differ on almost every critical issue facing Colombia: Duque favors forcibly eradicating coca crops that have skyrocketed to record levels, whereas Petro favors substitution. Historically tight relations between the U.S. and Colombia would likely remain unchanged under a Duque presidency, whereas Petro has called U.S. assistance to Colombia \"help that has served for nothing.\" In regards to the peace deal, Duque has said he'll introduce a constitutional reform mandating that drug trafficking cannot be an amnestied crime. Under the accord, guerrillas involved in drug trafficking and violent crimes during the conflict who fully confess can avoid jail time. Many Colombians consider those terms far too generous. The FARC long funded itself by leveling a \"war tax\" on cocaine moving through territory it dominated, and 50 members of its leadership structure were indicted in 2006 in the U.S. on charges of running the world's largest drug cartel. In April, Colombian authorities arrested a former top rebel peace negotiator on a U.S. drug warrant on charges that he conspired with three others to smuggle several tons of cocaine into the U.S. with a wholesale value of $15 million. In a victory speech to supporters little changed from his regular campaign stump, Duque stressed law and order issues that are red meat to his conservative base. He said he didn't want to \"tear up\" Colombia's peace agreement but rather make modifications that would ensure victims of the conflict achieve \"peace with justice.\" \"I want to be the president who unites our country and not govern with a rearview mirror,\" he said. Analysts said that mostly urban voters turned off by Colombia's polarizing politics will play kingmaker in the second round. Political analyst Ivan Valencia, himself a former rebel, said Duque will face a steeper challenge winning over supporters of Fajardo and other centrist candidates because he's more hostile to the peace process, while Petro from the campaign's outset has tried to portray himself \u2014 so far with mixes success \u2014 as a moderate. \"Whichever candidate is able to move more to the center is the one who will win the election,\" said Valencia. De la Calle, the government's chief negotiator with the FARC, without specifically endorsing Petro, made an impassioned plea not to backtrack on implementation of the peace accord when a future free of armed conflict is within reach. \"The war brought us together during eight years,\" he said. \"And now peace is dividing us.\"",

Elizabeth Warren took a formal step toward a potential 2020 presidential campaign Monday morning, announcing in an email to supporters and video message on social media that she is forming an exploratory committee to test the viability of a bid for the White House.\u00a0 The Federal Election Commission posted her statement of organization later in the day. The Massachusetts Democrat expanded on her plans later in the day. She plans to begin traveling to the early-voting primary and caucus states soon. The exploratory committee will enable her to raise money to pay for that travel and to hire staff for this effort. \"The problem we've got right now in Washington is that it works great for those who've got money to buy influence, and I'm fighting against that, and you bet it's going to make a lot of people unhappy,\" said Warren, who spoke in generalities when reporters asked about her reason for running Monday afternoon.\u00a0 In her letter to supporters Monday morning, Warren said that she \"never in a zillion years\" thought she would run for office.

She lays out the vision for her presidency in the video as one in which democracy and our economy \"work for all of us.\" \u00a0 \"In our country if you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to take care of yourself and the people you love. That's a fundamental promise of America,\" she said. Warren talked about her own family's struggles -- her father was a janitor and her mother worked at Sears -- and yet, Warren grew up to be be a teacher, a law professor and a senator. Now, she believes \"working families today face a lot tougher path than my family did. And families of color face a path that is steeper and rockier. A path made even harder by the impact of generations of discrimination.\" While Warren represents Massachusetts, she was born and raised in Oklahoma, attended college in New Jersey, and taught at law schools in Texas and Pennsylvania before her Harvard job. Former students include Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., and incoming Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif. The Massachusetts senator, who just won re-election to her second Senate term and will be sworn in Thursday, said in September that she'd take a \"hard look\" at a bid for the White House after the midterms.\u00a0 Avid 2020 watchers noted that a couple of days ago Warren\u00a0changed her campaign Twitter account from @ElizabethForMA to a more general handle -- @EWarren -- according to a bot that tracks changes in congressional Twitter accounts.\u00a0 Over the past month, Warren has been personally reaching out to key Democratic constituencies in early-voting states, according to media reports. The Des Moines Register\u00a0reported\u00a0that top Iowa Democrats are among those she's been talking to as she mulls the viability of a presidential campaign. \"She's not calling me to ask about the weather or my Christmas plans,\"\u00a0Tri-County Democrats Chairman Kurt Meyer\u00a0told the Des Moines Register. Warren phoned him in early December.\u00a0  In late November Warren delivered a speech staking out positions on foreign policy issues, like the president's new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and American involvement in Afghanistan.\u00a0  In the fall, the Massachusetts Democrat also released the results of a DNA test\u00a0that she says shows she has some Native American heritage. She explained that she had done so to show \"I won't sit quietly for @realDonaldTrump's racism.\"\u00a0  President Trump has often taunted Warren, dubbing her \"Pocahontas\" to mock her claims of Native American heritage, and he had offered her $1 million to take a DNA test. However, once she took the test, he added the caveat that he would have to administer the test himself.  To announce the results of the DNA test, Warren used a campaign-style video that tried to directly address questions about her heritage. It's a controversy that has dogged Warren since she first ran for the Senate six years ago.  In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Mr. Trump again commented on Warren's heritage. \"She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage. That didn't work out too well,\" the president told \"All-American New Year\" co-host Pete Hegseth. \"I think you have more than she does, and maybe I do too and I have nothing. So, we'll see how she does, I wish her well, I hope she does well, I'd love to run against her.\" Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, said that Warren's candidacy \"couldn't be more out of touch.\"\u00a0 \"With her lack of support from voters \u2013 including in her home state \u2013 on top of her phony claim to minority status, now that she is formally running Americans will see her for what she is: another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud,\" McDaniel said in a statement. \"Voters know President Trump's agenda gets results and they will make their voices heard at the ballot box in 2020.\" Warren is a staunch consumer advocate who played a key role in the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration. She's also a former Harvard professor known for her progressive politics and her populist views on the economy.  Jack Turman, Grace Segers and Alex Sundby contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "With the Iowa caucuses just over a year away, Democratic caucusgoers are most likely to say former Vice President Joe Biden is their pick for 2020. A new poll\u00a0from CNN, the Des Moines Register and Mediacom reveals 32 percent of likely caucusgoers say Biden is their first choice. He is followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, with 19 percent support, Rep. Beto O'Rourke with 11 percent, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren with 8 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris with 5 percent. Biden also has the highest favorability rating among likely Democratic caucusgoers, at 82 percent. An earlier CNN poll in October of Democratic voters nationwide also landed Biden on top.\u00a0 Not only does Biden generate the most support among Democrats in Iowa \u2014 previous polls suggest the public thinks he has the best shot at defeating President Trump, who filed papers for reelection the day he took office last year. Mr. Trump has called Biden his \"dream\" opponent for 2020, but a July Politco/Morning Consult poll showed Biden beating Mr. Trump 46 percent to 35 percent in a hypothetical 2020 match-up.\u00a0 Taking the lead in early polling in Iowa doesn't always mean winning the caucuses, or making it all the way to the White House. In August 2015, the Des Moines Register showed Hillary Clinton polling ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders by 7 points. Clinton won the Iowa caucuses and the nomination of her party, but obviously lost in the general election. On the Republican side, in January 2015, the paper's polling showed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker leading the Republican pack, and he ended up dropping out of the race months before the Iowa caucuses. It was Texas Sen. Ted Cruz who won the caucuses, and he also bowed out of the race, making way for Mr. Trump.\u00a0 In June 2011 ahead of the 2012 caucuses, Des Moines Register polling showed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney with a slight edge over Michele Bachmann. But a final count of the votes in 2012 showed Rick Santorum the victor in the Iowa caucuses. Santorum dropped out of the race months later. Romney did end up winning the GOP nomination but lost the presidential election to the sitting president, Barack obama.\u00a0 In May 2007 ahead of the 2008 Iowa caucuses, it was John Edwards who held the lead in the Des Moines Register's polling. Then-Sen. Obama ultimately won the Iowa caucuses, and the White House. On the Republican side, in May 2007 it was Romney who had the edge in Des Moines Register polling. Other pollsters had now-Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani as the favorite. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee won the Iowa caucuses among Republicans in 2008. But the late Sen. John McCain, not Huckabee, clinched the GOP nomination, only to lose to Obama.\u00a0 Biden has yet to say whether he's running in 2020. He decided not to enter the race in 2016 and ultimately expressed some regret about that decision. In an October interview with \"CBS This Morning,\" Biden said he isn't deciding whether he should run based on polling.\u00a0 \"I don't think about the polling data,\" Biden told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Norah O'Donnell. \"I think about whether or not I should run based on very private decisions relating to my family and the loss of my son and what I want to do with the rest of my life. But I don't think of it in terms of can I win, can I \u2013 will I lose. That's not part of the calculation.\" Biden, despite his intense criticism of the president, doesn't think moving to impeach him is the right move for the Democratic Party.\u00a0 \"I think we should focus on all the terrible things that are happening now in terms of interest of the middle class people and working class people,\" Biden told \"CBS This Morning.\" The latest poll showing Biden leading among likely Democratic caucusgoers polled 455 registered voters with a margin of error of 4.6 percentage points.\u00a0 The Iowa caucuses are set for February 2020.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor who is running for a third term in November, is in trouble. He's being challenged in the Democratic primary by Cynthia Nixon, a progressive activist who's best known for playing Miranda on \"Sex and the City.\" And while Cuomo is the obvious favorite to win re-election, Nixon has a chance to defeat him.  Yes, but she'll have to run a masterful campaign. Nixon has never run for office before, and Cuomo has some $30 million in the bank, which is important in a state dominated by the extraordinarily expensive New York State media market. But Cuomo has some unique baggage, and New York has an odd system of voting that can benefit insurgents like Nixon. It would be a mistake to say she doesn't have a shot.  I love New York, and today I'm announcing my candidacy for governor. Join us: https://t.co/9DwsxWW8xX pic.twitter.com/kYTvx6GZiD On the one hand, Cuomo has a lot going for him. He's got plenty of money. He's relatively popular. He's the scion of a Democratic political dynasty, his father being Mario Cuomo, a charismatic and crusading liberal who was himself a three-term governor. Like his father, Andrew Cuomo also has national ambitions, which is really just a way of saying he probably wants to be president.  But Cuomo may be vulnerable to a challenge from his left. First elected governor in 2010, Cuomo marketed himself as a moderate who was big on fiscal discipline. He quickly made an alliance with Republicans in the state senate, which controls a majority due to a breakaway group of Democratic lawmakers who Cuomo stayed on good terms with.  This may have seemed like smart politics at the time. However, the Democratic Party's base started moving left in a major way over recent years. Cuomo has tried to catch up with them, touting his liberal positions on social issues and embracing progressive ideas like a $15 minimum wage and free college for some middle-class New Yorkers.  Still, progressives don't trust him, and he has a hilariously dysfunctional relationship with New York City's left-leaning mayor, Bill de Blasio. The mayor, who by just about any measure is more progressive than Cuomo, sees this election has an opportunity to get rid of, or at least bloody, his rival in Albany. And to that end, he's lending some of his political muscle to Nixon, his friend and longtime political ally.  Sure he can, and right now polls show him in an early lead. Also, it's very rare for an incumbent governor to lose re-election.  But, at this stage of the race, polls can be misleading. Everyone in New York knows who Andrew Cuomo is, but Nixon is still relatively unknown, despite her years of political activism. That means Nixon's standing has a lot of room to grow.  Cuomo is a famously sharp-elbowed and calculating politician who excels at negative campaigning. \"Ruthless\" is a word commonly used to describe him, by both detractors and supporters. Yet in the #MeToo era, he may have to hold his fire when dealing with Nixon. \"This time the boxing gloves he usually puts on cannot be laced up,'' Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime Democratic consultant and former Cuomo adviser, told The Buffalo News last week.  For example, just as Nixon got into the race last week, Christine Quinn -- a Cuomo ally and former New York City Council speaker -- called her an \"unqualified lesbian.\" Quinn, like Nixon, is openly gay. But Nixon had campaigned for de Blasio against Quinn when they ran against each other for mayor in 2013, making the comment seem like sour grapes. Quinn's comments appeared to quickly give Nixon a boost, and reflected poorly on Cuomo. Quinn later apologized.\u00a0 \"Good evening, unqualified lesbians!\" Cynthia Nixon says to crowd at the Stonewall Inn, quickly embracing comment from Christine Quinn. pic.twitter.com/sraVyDlyjo Does he ever. One of his former top aides and closest friends, Joseph Percoco, was just convicted on federal corruption charges. It was a major embarrassment for Cuomo, who has long touted himself as an anti-corruption reformer. To make matters worse, Cuomo implied his name was \"never mentioned\" during Percoco's trial. This prompted The New York Times to note that Cuomo's name had been mentioned 136 times during the trial.  Then there's the New York City subway system, which is the busiest in the world. The once-reliable service has been plagued with long wait times and spotty service in recent years, much to the frustration of the millions of New Yorkers who depend on it. De Blasio and Cuomo have repeatedly blamed each other for the subway's woes, but ultimately the MTA, which runs the subway, is a state agency, meaning that it's really Cuomo's problem.  Meanwhile, much of Upstate New York is mired in economic decline. This is a state of affairs that existed long before Cuomo entered office, but after eight years in the governor's mansion, vast swaths of the once-prosperous region are still losing jobs and losing people.  It is also worth noting that Cuomo, who has a famously quick temper and has never faced a truly competitive election for governor, may be a bit rusty on the stump. For example, a joke he made Sunday at a Harlem church about the dancing abilities of Jewish people reportedly fell flat. He also abruptly canceled an appearance at a fundraiser for the Nassau County Democratic Party on Monday night. It's not good for him. But Cuomo has survived a primary challenge before, defeating little-known academic Zephyr Teachout in 2014. But Teachout defied expectations by netting 33 percent of the vote, which is better than most people thought she would do. De Blasio also endorsed Cuomo in 2014, and helped him secure the backing of the small yet influential Working Families Party (WFP).  New York has an odd \"fusion voting\" system that allows minor parties to occupy space on the ballot and cross-endorse the candidates of other parties. So candidates often have their names on the ballot more than once, which tends to help their odds.  This gives minor parties like WFP some degree of influence over which candidates the two big parties nominate. The two big minor parties are the WFP, which typically cross-endorses the Democratic candidate, and the Conservative Party, which usually cross-endorses with the Republican.  Sometimes, however, the smaller parties think the big-party nominee is too moderate, and endorse somebody else. When this happens, the WFP can siphon away votes from the Democrats, and the Conservatives can do the same to the GOP. In 1971, the Conservative Party even elected a U.S. senator, successfully running James Buckley (the brother of National Review founder William F. Buckley) against the Democratic and Republican nominees.  De Blasio and Nixon are both closely tied to the WFP. Should Nixon win the WFP nomination, she could wind up on the general election ballot in November even if Cuomo beats her in September's Democratic primary. That could split the liberal vote, and maybe even give the New York GOP a chance at winning their first statewide race since 2002.  A lot can happen between now and September, and Cuomo is still the clear favorite to win not only the Democratic primary but also the general. Still, this should still be a heck of a race.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is embracing the potential for a trade war after announcing his intent to place tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as he rebuffs allies who have pushed to be exempted from the stiff duties. The protectionist policy will be made official in the next two weeks, White House officials said Sunday, as the administration defended the decision from critics in Washington and overseas. Mr. Trump appeared unbowed Sunday, as he tweeted that American \"Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it's time for a change!\" Mr. Trump's pronouncement Thursday that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively, on imported steel and aluminum, roiled markets and rankled allies. While his rhetoric has been focused on China, the duties will also cover significant imports from Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and the European Union. Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said: \"At this point in time there's no country exclusions.\" The across-the-board action breaks with the recommendation of the Pentagon, which pushed for more targeted tariffs on metals imports from countries like China and warned that a wide-ranging move would jeopardize national security partnerships. But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose agency oversaw reviews of the industries that recommended the tariffs, said Sunday ABC's \"This Week\" that Trump is \"talking about a fairly broad brush.\" Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said the sweeping action would let China \"off the hook,\" adding the tariffs would drive a wedge between the U.S. and its allies. \"China wins when we fight with Europe,\" he said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \u2033China wins when the American consumer has higher prices because of tariffs that don't affect Chinese behavior.\" Mr. Trump has threatened to tax European cars if the EU boosts tariffs on American products in response to the president's plan to increase duties on steel and aluminum. British Prime Minister Theresa May raised her \"deep concern\" at the tariff announcement in a phone call with Mr. Trump Sunday. May's office says she \"raised our deep concern at the president's forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminum tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity.\" But Ross rejected threats of retaliation from American allies as \"pretty trivial\" and not much more than a \"rounding error.\" Few issues could blur the lines of partisanship in Trump-era Washington. Trade is one of them. Labor unions and liberal Democrats are in the unusual position of applauding Trump's approach, while Republicans and an array of business groups are warning of dire economic and political consequences if he goes ahead with the tariffs. Trade politics often cut along regional, rather than ideological, lines, as politicians reflect the interests of the hometown industries and workers. But rarely does a debate open so wide a rift between a president and his party \u2014 leaving him almost exclusively with support from his ideological opposites. \"Good, finally,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat and progressive as he cheered Trump's move. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who has called for Trump to resign, agreed. \"I urge the administration to follow through and to take aggressive measures to ensure our workers can compete on a level playing field,\" Casey tweeted. This moment of unusual alliance was long expected. As a candidate, Mr. Trump made his populist and protectionist positions on trade quite clear, at times hitting the same themes as one of the Democratic presidential candidates, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \"This wave of globalization has wiped out totally, totally our middle class,\" Trump told voters in the hard-hit steel town of Monessen, Pennsylvania, during one of his campaign stops. \"It doesn't have to be this way.\" Mr. Trump's criticism of trade agreements and China's trade policies found support with white working-class Americans whose wages had stagnated over the years. Victories in big steel-producing states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana demonstrated that his tough trade talk had a receptive audience. Both candidates in a March 13 House election in Pennsylvania have embraced the president's plans for tariffs. They addressed the topic Saturday in a debate that aired on WTAE in Pittsburgh. \"For too long, China has been making cheap steel and they've been flooding the market with it. It's not fair and it's not right. So I actually think this is long overdue,\" said Democratic candidate Conor Lamb. \"Unfortunately, many of our competitors around the world have slanted the playing field, and their thumb has been on the scale, and I think President Trump is trying to even that scale back out,\" said Republican candidate Rick Saccone. But Mr. Trump's GOP allies on Capitol Hill have little use for the tariff approach. They argue that other industries that rely on steel and aluminum products will suffer. The cost of new appliances, cars and buildings will rise if the president follows through, they warn, and other nations could retaliate. The end result could erode the president's base of support with rural America and even the blue-collar workers the president says he trying to help. \"There is always retaliation, and typically a lot of these countries single out agriculture when they do that. So, we're very concerned,\" said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., asked the administration to reconsider its stance. He said American companies could move their operations abroad and not face retaliatory tariffs. \"This scenario would lead to the exact opposite outcome of the administration's stated objective, which is to protect American jobs,\" Walker said. The Business Roundtable's Josh Bolten, a chief of staff for President George W. Bush, called on Mr. Trump to have \"the courage\" to step back from his campaign rhetoric on trade. \"Sometimes a president needs to, you need to stick to your principles but you also need to recognize in cases where stuff you said in the campaign isn't right and ought to be drawn back,\" he said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \u2033The president needs to have the courage to do that.\" Tim Phillips, president of the Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity, noted that Mr. Trump narrowly won in Iowa and Wisconsin, two heavily rural states that could suffer if countries impose retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural goods. \"It hurts the administration politically because trade wars, protectionism, they lead to higher prices for individual Americans,\" Phillips said. \"It's basically a tax increase.\" The president wasn't backing down, at least on Twitter, where he posted this message: \"Trade wars are good, and easy to win.\"",

            "article_content": "Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former Mayor of New York City, is considering a run for presidency as a Democrat, he told the New York Times. \"It's impossible to conceive that I could run as a Republican \u2014 things like choice, so many of the issues, I'm just way away from where the Republican Party is today,\" Mr. Bloomberg told the Times, in a story that was posted Monday. \"That's not to say I'm with the Democratic Party on everything, but I don't see how you could possibly run as a Republican. So if you ran, yeah, you'd have to run as a Democrat.\" \u00a0 He told the Times that he firmly believes that a candidate has to run as a major-party candidate. Bloomberg has the money to fund a presidential run. Born into a middle-class Boston family, his fortune is now estimated at over $50 billion, making him the 11th richest person in the world. His company's signature product, the Bloomberg Terminal, is a fixture at major financial firms.\u00a0 He's using some of his fortune -- $80 million -- to help Democrats recapture the House majority in the midterm elections. But Bloomberg would face resistance on some fronts in the party, especially from progressives. He was dubious of some of the sexual misconduct claims about media figures, according to the Times. Bloomberg defended Charlie Rose, the former \"CBS This Morning\" and PBS anchor who broadcast his PBS show from Bloomberg's company in New York.\u00a0 \"We never had a complaint, whatsoever, and when I read some of the stuff, I was surprised, I will say. But I never saw anything and we have no record, we've checked very carefully,\" Bloomberg told the Times. He suggested, \"Let the court system decide\" whether Rose is guilty of the allegations against him, though he acknowledged the claims might never be examined by a court. And Bloomberg may also lack a record that would readily endear him to left-leaning voters.  The longtime Democrat became a Republican in 2001 when he wanted to run for New York mayor \u2013 the local GOP offered him their ballot line, which allowed Bloomberg to sidestep a primary. Initially written off as a candidate by observers, Bloomberg was elected mayor after he was endorsed by Rudy Giuliani, who had become the most popular politician in America following the 9/11 attacks.  As mayor, Bloomberg oversaw the rebuilding of lower Manhattan amid declining crime rates and significant demographic changes. In addition to being mayor, he was also sometimes the city's single richest citizen, giving him unparalleled power over the nation's largest metropolis.  But Bloomberg was also unafraid to pick fights across the ideological spectrum. He eventually dropped his Republican affiliation, deciding to run for reelection as an independent, while also flooding anti-gun organizations across the country with cash. A social liberal, he also led crusades against salt in restaurants and sugar-filled sodas he saw as a health hazard. Bloomberg, aided by a subservient city council, changed the laws that would have prevented him from running for a third term. Making use of his essentially unlimited wealth, Bloomberg fended off a stronger-than-expected Democratic challenger amid liberal concerns about his policies on crime and housing.  Since leaving office in 2013, Bloomberg has spent his time and money championing new restrictions on gun ownership and initiatives to fight climate change. He had considered running for president in 2008, 2012, and 2016, but eventually abstained on all three occasions. In 2016, he endorsed Hillary Clinton and spoke at the Democratic convention.  Should Bloomberg decide to run in 2020, he would be one of a number of New Yorkers who could potentially seek the office.  Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and current New York Mayor Bill de Blasio have all been touted as possible candidates. And the current commander-in-chief, President Donald Trump, is a New Yorker as well.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "CONCORD, N.H. -- New Hampshire Democrats on Tuesday nominated a former state senator who emphasized her single-mom background as governor and a gay man who worked his way up through local politics as their nominee for Congress in a key swing district. Former state Sen. Molly Kelly defeated former Portsmouth Mayor Steve Marchand to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and will face Republican Gov. Chris Sununu in November. Sununu, in his first term, faced no primary opposition. Kelly said strong Democratic turnout should send a message to Sununu that voters want someone who will put the people first, not corporate special interests. A five-term senator from Harrisville, she frequently emphasized her experience as a single mother who raised three children while putting herself through college.\u00a0 \"The people of New Hampshire know that I will fight for them every single day because I understand their struggles,\" she said in a statement Tuesday night. \"Chris Sununu should not underestimate me. I've been underestimated before.\" Executive Councilor Chris Pappas won an 11-way race for the Democratic nomination in the 1st Congressional district. Pappas, who is openly gay, is a former state lawmaker who is serving his third term on the governor's Executive Council and runs a family restaurant in Manchester. He had the backing of the state's two Democratic U.S. senators, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, and touted his strong financial support from New Hampshire residents. \"It's about having an effort that is home-grown, that's about who we are as Granite Staters, to try to push back forcefully against what we're seeing in Washington, which are destructive policies that are undermining opportunities for working people and middle-class families,\" he said in an interview last week. It was in that District that Democrat Carol Shea-Porter's decision to step down after four nonconsecutive terms resulted in a swarm of candidates seeking to replace her. They included Levi Sanders, son of Vermont senator and former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, who came up short. The younger Sanders\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0that he would not vote for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as House speaker should the Democrats take the House, but would support Rep. Barbara Lee. Sanders has not been endorsed by his father. The district, which covers the eastern half of the state, was once reliably Republican but has flipped in each of the past four cycles. In 2016, it returned Shea-Porter to Congress but backed President Trump. CBS News rates New Hampshire's 1st District race as competitive this fall. \u00a0 State Sen. Andy Sanborn and Eddie Edwards, former enforcement chief for the state liquor commission, have emerged as the front-runners in the six-candidate Republican race. Late Wednesday night, Edwards grabbed the party's nomination for the U.S. House. Edwards, who has received the backing of Mr. Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, has sought to make the race about character and integrity, and he has also said he'd refuse to support Sanborn as the nominee. Sanborn, a four-term senator from Bedford, has acknowledged making a sexual \"joke\" to a Statehouse intern in 2013 but said a recent investigation into the matter was politically motivated. Seven Republicans were competing for a chance to face Democratic U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster in the 2nd Congressional District. But most of the action was in the eastern 1st District. On the crowded Democratic side, former Obama administration official Maura Sullivan raised more money than the other 10 candidates combined, but she's faced criticism for being both new to the state and voting in general. She moved to the state last year, and acknowledged not voting in several recent elections. She said she and her fianc\u00e9 moved to New Hampshire last year to put down roots, but her opponents have accused her of district shopping. After the New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper reported that she failed to vote in either of the past two midterm elections or the 2016 presidential primary, Sullivan said she regrets not voting more often but saw herself as a soldier and public servant. Secretary of State William Gardner was predicting 180,000 ballots will be cast, roughly split among Democrats and Republicans. That amounts to about 19 percent of registered voters and would be a record for Democratic ballots cast in a midterm primary. Rhode Island holds its primary Wednesday, and New York follows a day later. Caitlin Conant contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "In the last few months, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has become one of the most prominent political faces of the #MeToo movement. Her candor and willingness to be out front has also made her a lightning rod. This week on the broadcast, the junior senator from New York talks with Sharyn Alfonsi about her decision to call out members of her own party, including former President Bill Clinton and Senator Al Franken, whom she urged to resign in December. Gillibrand also tells 60 Minutes that Congress is still an \"old boys club,\" in part because women are hesitant to run. \"I think it's hard to run for office,\" she says on the broadcast. \"You know, a lot of women don't like the negative campaigning. They don't like the aggressiveness of it.\" In the clip above, she also says there are other reasons why women might decide against stepping into the political fray. A lot of women, she says, want to protect their families from the \"rough and tumble\" aspect of politics\u2014especially when there are other ways to serve their country. \"So if you have a choice between serving in a local charity or being in some kind of social services role, those are often much more attractive because you can still help people,\" she says, \"but you don't have to go through the difficulty of running for office.\" That's why she offers this advice to prospective candidates: If you don't fight for what you want, no one else will. \"The reason you have to run is because the things you care about are not being represented right now,\" she says. \"The things you want to change aren't being worked on and aren't going to change.\" Gillibrand knows first-hand about the negative campaigning that some women might fear. In the clip above, she talks with Alfonsi about her 2008 Congressional re-election campaign. She was running against longtime New York Republican party leader Sandy Treadwell, a self-funded candidate with a large war chest to spend on campaign ads, including many negative ones. Gillibrand decided to just ignore them. \u00a0 \"We turned off the TV for three months before the elections\u2014turned off the TV,\" she says. Ignoring the negativity is something Gillibrand says she learned from her grandmother, Polly Noonan, who was a back-room power broker for the Albany Democratic party. \"Politics is rough and tumble, and you just don't listen to that part,\" Gillibrand says. \"That it's like if you're playing a sport, the job of the other team is to hit you as hard as they can.\" After two years in Congress, Gillibrand was appointed in 2009 to fill the senate seat vacated when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State. At the time, she worried the women's movement had ended. \"I was worried the women's movement was dead or dying because the percentage of women actually went down in the House of Representatives,\" she says in the clip above. \"We had voted on an anti-choice bill on the House floor with a Democratic speaker and Democratic president. And there wasn't an outcry. I felt like women's voices weren't being heard.\" But now, she says, in response to Donald Trump winning the election, the Women's March has reignited the cause. The movement to speak out even helped in the Democrats' successful fight against repealing the Affordable Care Act, Gillibrand says. \"It's a revolution,\" she says, \"and it's incredibly powerful.\" But why, Alfonsi asks Gillibrand in the clip above, have the Democrats struggled with appealing to white middle-class voters? \"If the question you're asking is why did President Trump win, I have a theory,\" Gillibrand answers. \"President Trump ran on a couple of Democratic messages. He just ran on them well. His first message really was, 'The system's rigged.' And the system is rigged. That was a message that was our message.\" \"But,\" Alfonsi points out, \"he won with it.\" \"I got it. He stole our message,\" Gillibrand says. \"Did he mean it? Has he done anything to reward work in this country? Has he done anything to change the shift away from just share value and towards investing in employees? No.\" He does change the conversation, Alfonsi says, every time he tweets. Is the Democrats' message getting lost in the noise? \"Well, that's my job,\" Gillibrand says. \"I have to speak out to my constituents to prove to them that I'm working for them.\" The videos above were edited by Will Croxton.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "TORONTO --\u00a0The United States and Canada announced late Sunday they'd\u00a0reached a deal for Canada to stay in the North American trade pact with the United States and Mexico. The announcement was made an hour before a White House-imposed deadline of midnight on Sept 30. In a joint statement, U.S.Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said the accord would be renamed the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement). They asserted that USMCA would result in freer markets and fairer trade. \"USMCA will give our workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region,\" the joint statement said. \"It will strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home.\" The agreement\u00a0gives U.S. farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market. But it keeps a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) dispute-resolution process that the U.S. wanted to jettison and offers Canada protection if President Trump goes ahead with plans to impose tariffs on cars, trucks and auto parts imported into the U.S. The president took to Twitter early Monday to sing the deal's praises: Congratulations to Mexico and Canada! In another tweet, Mr. Trump said the new agreement \"greatly opens markets to our Farmers and Manufacturers, reduce[s] Trade Barriers to the U.S. and will bring all three Great Nations closer together in competition with the rest of the world.\" ....deficiencies and mistakes in NAFTA, greatly opens markets to our Farmers and Manufacturers, reduces Trade Barriers to the U.S. and will bring all three Great Nations together in competition with the rest of the world. The USMCA is a historic transaction! Senior administration officials speaking with CBS News called the pact a \"big win\" for the U.S. Canadian and Mexican officials praised it. \"It's a good day for Canada,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said as he left his office. Trudeau said he would have more to say Monday. \"It is a good night for Mexico, and for North America,\" Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray tweeted. \"We celebrate a trilateral deal. The door closes on trade fragmentation in the region,\" Jesus Seade, trade negotiator for Mexico's incoming president, said via Twitter. Representatives of Mexican president-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador called a news conference for Monday to discuss details of the deal. The administration officials told CBS News they expected it to be signed by Mr. Trump and his Canadian and Mexican counterparts on Nov. 30, then submitted to Congress, with a vote expected some time next year. Getting Congressional approval could be difficult, especially if Democrats take control of the House, the officials said. They noted that the accord would come up for review every six years, which they said would give the U.S. significant leverage if Canada or Mexico don't comply with any parts of it. The importance of a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal can't be underestimated: Trade among the three partners affects jobs and profits in all of them, and all three wanted to get a deal done before the change of government in Mexico in two months, CBS News' Pamela Falk reports. The original North America deal took years to negotiate and commerce among the U.S., Mexico and Canada has relied on the continuation of a trade accord, Falk added. Canada, the United States' No. 2 trading partner, was left out when the U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement last month to revamp NAFTA.   So much American trade depends on the 1994 deal that U.S. financial markets were jittery about a possible collapse of negotiations -- and because Mr. Trump made campaign promises to get rid of NAFTA. Mexico's economics ministry said in a tweet earlier Sunday that the text of the pact would be delivered to the Mexican Senate Sunday night, adding that, \"If there is agreement with Canada, the text will be trilateral. If there is not, it will be bilateral.\" Mr. Trump had said he wanted to go ahead with a revamped NAFTA -- with or without Canada. It was unclear, however, whether he had authority from Congress to pursue a revamped NAFTA with only Mexico, and some lawmakers said they wouldn't go along with a deal that left out Canada. U.S.-Canada talks bogged down earlier this month, and most trade analysts expected the Sept. 30 deadline to come and go without Canada being reinstated. They suspected Canada, which had said it wasn't bound by U.S. deadlines, was delaying the talks until after provincial elections Monday in Quebec, where support for Canadian dairy tariffs runs high.",

            "article_content": "Over the protests of many Democrats, the Senate on Wednesday evening approved President Donald Trump's choice to become the new head of the IRS. Democrats opposed the nomination because of a new Trump administration policy allowing some groups involved in politics to hide their donors' identities. The Senate voted 64-33 to confirm Beverly Hills tax attorney Charles Rettig as Internal Revenue Service commissioner. Democrats who voted against him did so even though they considered him qualified for the job. Still, 15 Democrats voted with the Republicans to approve Rettig. With the midterm elections barely two months away, critics say the new policy announced by the IRS in July will let more dark money \u2014 including from foreign interests \u2014 flood into the U.S. political system. The policy lifted donor disclosure requirements for thousands of groups, including those spending millions on political ads. Groups that will benefit include so-called social-welfare organizations, business leagues and labor unions. Among them are sections of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and a group linked to the billionaire Koch brothers. The Democrats say that although Rettig is qualified for the position, they needed to register their concern over the new IRS policy. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said he asked Rettig to commit to changing the new rule, without result. \"He wouldn't even acknowledge that there is a real problem here for the cause of transparency and openness in our democracy,\" Wyden said in remarks on the Senate floor before the vote. \"So over the next two months, while political ads flood the airwaves, millions of Americans are going to wonder how much of this stuff is paid for by lawbreaking foreigners and special interests,\" Wyden said. \"Because of the new rule, the IRS and law enforcers are going to be in the dark, too. ... This is as corrupt as anything I know of before the United States Senate.\" News of the IRS policy change this summer came the same day federal prosecutors charged a gun-rights activist living in Washington with serving as a covert Russian agent gathering intelligence on U.S. officials and political organizations. Court papers show that the activist, Maria Butina, made efforts to use contacts with the National Rifle Association to develop relationships with U.S. politicians during the 2016 campaign. The revelations of alleged Russian efforts to use the NRA as a conduit into political influence, coming soon after Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stoked the Democrats' furor over the IRS action as part of a string of related events. Rettig faces the challenge of administering the sweeping $1.5 trillion tax law enacted by Republicans in Congress in December, which became Trump's signature legislative achievement. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Rettig also is expected to work to modernize the IRS' outdated technology. \"With the biggest tax overhaul in a generation on the books, it's about time that the agency charged with administering our nation's tax laws has a confirmed commissioner,\" Hatch said Wednesday. Trump named Rettig nearly eight months ago, and an acting commissioner has filled the role. As a tax attorney, Rettig has represented thousands of individuals and companies in civil and criminal tax matters before the IRS and against it in court. His clients have included affluent taxpayers seeking to strike deals with the IRS to turn over information on offshore bank accounts in exchange for reduced penalties. During the 2016 campaign, Rettig defended Trump's decision to break with tradition by refusing to release his personal tax filings. At his confirmation hearing last month, Rettig pledged to uphold the political independence of the IRS. Opposition from some Democrats also stemmed from another new IRS rule aimed at preventing residents in high-tax states from avoiding a new cap on widely popular state and local tax deductions. The action under the new Republican tax law pitted the Trump administration against high-tax, heavily Democratic states. That rule targets moves by states like New York, New Jersey and California \u2014 where residents could see substantial increases in their federal tax bills next spring because of the $10,000 cap on state and local deductions. The cap was put in as a compromise to eliminating the deductions completely, as part of the massive GOP tax package. Experts say the issue likely will have to be resolved by the federal courts. On the Senate floor, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., called the move \"one giant hit job on New Jersey's middle class.\" The Democrats voting to approve Rettig were Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ben Cardin of Maryland, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Doug Jones of Alabama, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Christopher Murphy of Connecticut, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.",

            "article_content": "The trade understanding between the U.S. and Mexico announced by President Donald Trump Monday sets into motion a series of events that could lead to an overhaul of the North American Free Trade agreement. Although NAFTA has been in force among the U.S., Mexico and Canada since 1994, Mr. Trump doesn't want the new deal to be called NAFTA.\u00a0 Whatever it's called, the deal appears significant, but it lacks detailed specifics. It does add pressure on Canada to reenter the talks if the 1994 agreement is to be overhauled. Plus, Congress must approve the changes. All of this is on a very tight timetable, economists and observers said. The preliminary deal may encourage more manufacturing in the U.S. Yet it's far from final. Even after being formally signed, Mexico's lawmakers also must ratify it.  Here are some key points from the announcement and what may happen next: Mr. Trump's announcement includes plans to wrap up negotiations between the U.S., Canada and Mexico by Saturday at the latest. That deadline targets a final sign-off by Mexico's current President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto before his administration leaves in November. \"We could have a separate deal [with Canada], or we could put it into this deal,\" Mr. Trump said today. Canada hasn't participated in the renegotiations for two months. And Mr. Trump said individual trade deals are still on the table. He threatened tariffs on autos imported from Canada as another way to keep up pressure. Canada said it was \"encouraged by the continued optimism shown by our negotiation partners,\" according to Adam Austen, spokesperson for Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, who called progress between the U.S. and Mexico \"necessary.\" \"We are in regular contact with our negotiating partners, and we will continue to work toward a modernized NAFTA,\" Austen said. \"We will only sign a new NAFTA that is good for Canada and good for the middle class. Canada's signature is required.\" Mr. Trump has the authority to renegotiate NAFTA as a trilateral agreement, so Canada must be involved, said Michelle Casario, an assistant professor of economics at Villanova University. \u00a0 Even if Canada and the U.S. work out their differences, \"Congress has a very tight window to ratify any new trade deal, there is no guarantee that an agreement will be in place by the end of this year,\" analysts at Moody's Investors Service said in an email. Under the U.S. Trade Promotion Authority law, known as TPA or \"fast track,\" Mr. Trump must wait 90 days to sign an agreement after notifying Congress of his intention to do so. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican and chairman of the subcommittee on international trade, said in a statement the Mexico agreement is a \"positive step,\" but he added that Canada needs to be party to a final deal. \"A trilateral agreement is the best path forward,\" he said, noting millions of jobs are at stake. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told reporters Monday a TPA notice should be sent by Friday, triggering the 90-day period. Canada will have an option to sign into the agreement later if a breakthrough doesn't happen this week, he said. \"The accelerated timeline to reach agreement with Canada over the next week presents a risk to the finalization of the deal,\" Raymond James analyst Ed Mills wrote in a note. That's because the midterm elections might make it tougher for Mr. Trump to get what he wants from Congress. \"There is a good chance that control of the House majority might have flipped to the Democrats, who could have different views on some aspects of the agreement than the Administration, making ultimate passage somewhat more difficult,\" Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips wrote in a note. One piece that may ease tensions with Canada: The U.S. softened its demand for a five-year \"sunset clause\" requiring the deal to be renewed, a sticking point that led to the stalemate with Canada. The U.S.-Mexico agreement now includes a six-year mandated review period with Mexico. If the parties don't come up with a renewal, the agreement would end in 10 years. Neither President Trump nor Pe\u00f1a Nieto   mentioned the sunset clause during their announcement. The agreement has some key changes for the auto, farming and textile industries but is short on the detailed text typical among nations before an agreement is signed, experts said. Fact sheets from the U.S. Trade Representative are \"really incredibly thin for someone who claims to have negotiated the biggest trade deal in history,\" said Height Capital analyst Clayton Allen in an interview. \"The only things we know for sure, content has to come within the NAFTA region.\" Mexico agreed to ensure that 75 percent of automotive content will be produced within the trade bloc, up from a current 62.5 percent, to receive duty-free benefits. But no further details were available. It also mandates 40 percent to 45 percent of content will be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour. Those changes are meant to encourage more auto production in the U.S. But the changes in labor rules may raise costs for consumers. The global auto supply chain is so complex and integrated, the changes would be difficult as outlined, Villanova's Casario said. \"The bottom line here is the agreement would increase production costs, and that would increase costs for consumers,\" Casario said. Digital trade is now included, and intellectual property rights were also added. Both those items may improve on the 1994 NAFTA agreement as technology has evolved, Casario said.\u00a0 Duty-free access to farm products will also stay in the deal, and Mexico agreed to immediately start buying as many U.S. farm products as possible. That should please farmers, Allen said. --\u00a0The Associated Press contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump thinks the stock market would \"crash\" if he were impeached and \"everybody would be very poor.\" Wall Street analysts beg to differ. Exhibit A: For now, financial markets have largely shrugged off Mr. Trump's political woes. Leading stock indexes are little changed since Tuesday, when his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, seemed to implicate the president in campaign finance violations and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u00a0was convicted on eight counts\u00a0of bank fraud.\u00a0 Although investors famously hate the kind of uncertainty that can come with a major presidential crisis, analysts say Wall Street remains focused on more tangible concerns, such as how Mr. Trump's protectionist trade agenda could affect U.S. economic growth. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR, also notes that investors are already reaping the benefits of Mr. Trump's economic policies, such as his steep corporate tax cuts. \"The market isn't sentimental,\" Hogan said. \"It looks at the administration, and we've gotten the pro-business policies that the market wanted. That's locked and loaded.\" The president's exit from the political stage could even benefit stocks given the widespread opposition in the financial and corporate world to Mr. Trump's trade policies, which have led to tensions with China, Europe and other major economies around the world. Mr. Trump's Twitter habits also wouldn't be missed, Hogan said. \"It loses [Mr. Trump's] disruptive tweets and bad economic policy toward trade, and the market looks at that as a positive,\" he said. Vice President Mike Pence, who would step into the president's role if Mr. Trump were impeached, \"doesn't seem to be a protectionist and a hawk, so you might have a market that reacts positively to it at some juncture.\" Investors are particularly concerned with the prospects of a prolonged trade war with China. Credit rating agency Moody's predicted in a report on Wednesday that America's trade relations with the world's second-largest economy would worsen and dent U.S. growth.\u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile, a post-impeachment slide in stocks -- while that could affect investor and business sentiment -- likely wouldn't inflict a a serious financial toll on most Americans given that most shares are held by a small fraction of wealthy Americans.\u00a0 In other words, many middle-class and lower-income households would feel little impact from a market downdraft simply because they don't own stocks.\u00a0 History offers some precedent for assessing how the stock market might react following the impeachment and ouster of a sitting president. During the Watergate scandal, when President Richard Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment, stocks fell sharply. The S&P 500 slumped more than 20 percent between the time of the Watergate break-in and Nixon's resignation.\u00a0 But stocks were falling well before the drama over Watergate, Capital Economics notes, with investors focused more on a steep slowdown in economic growth at the time, the impact of OPEC's oil embargo and runaway inflation. More important, stocks came roaring back after Nixon's exit. After President Clinton was impeached in 1998 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, stocks actually rose sharply. While the nation may have been riveted by the political and personal spectacle, investors mostly looked past it and instead focused on the era's booming corporate profits, strong wage growth, low unemployment and surging tech sector.\u00a0 One lesson from these episodes, experts say: Wall Street tends to concentrate on risks it can quantify. Those tend to be issues like tax and trade policies, unemployment, wages and corporate profitability.\u00a0 \"Of course, it would be unfair to dismiss the influence of politics altogether,\" Capital Economics said in a report. \"The S&P 500 did rally strongly in the wake of President Trump's election victory, and has occasionally reacted to his statements on trade and the Fed.\" Still, it added, \"Overall, though, we think that influence of politics will remain small.\"",

            "article_content": "A congressional watchdog said the Trump administration needs to step up its management of sign-up seasons for former President Barack Obama's health care law after mixed results last year in the throes of a failed GOP effort to repeal it. The report due out Thursday from the Government Accountability Office is likely to add to Democrats' election-year narrative that the administration actively undermined \"Obamacare\" without regard for the consequences to consumers. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office was more nuanced. On one hand, it found problems with consumer counseling and advertising and recommended such basic fixes as setting enrollment targets. But it also credited administration actions that did help people enroll, such as a more reliable HealthCare.gov website and reduced call center wait times. Sign-ups for 2019 begin this November. A copy of the report from the investigative agency for Congress was provided to The Associated Press. It found that: The Health and Human Services Department under Trump broke with its own previous practice by failing to set enrollment targets for HealthCare.gov last year. The watchdog recommended that HHS resume setting goals, a standard management tool for government agencies. Without setting numeric goals, HHS won't be able to measure whether it is meeting \"its current objective of improving Americans' access to health care,\" the report said. The administration responded that it does not believe such targets are relevant. HHS used \"problematic\" and \"unreliable\" data to justify a 40 percent cut in funding for enrollment counseling programs known as Navigators. HHS responded that it's making changes to how those counseling programs are evaluated. But it has cut funding again, by about 70 percent. When HHS slashed money for open-enrollment advertising by 90 percent overall, officials said they were doing away with wasteful spending. But an internal study by the department had actually found paid television ads were one of the most effective ways to enroll consumers. The budget for TV ads went from $26.6 million in the Obama administration's final year to zero under President Donald Trump. \"This independent and nonpartisan GAO report confirms that the Trump administration's sabotage of our health care system is driving up costs for consumers and leaving more Americans without health insurance,\" said a statement from a group of Democratic lawmakers led by Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey. HHS said in a statement that the 2018 enrollment season was the \"most cost-effective and successful experience\" for consumers, citing a 90 percent customer satisfaction rate with the HealthCare.gov call center. Republicans' drive to \"repeal and replace\" the health care law stalled in the Senate last year, and the Trump administration instead found itself having to run a program the president repeatedly branded a \"disaster.\" The watchdog found that sign-ups in the 39 states served by HHS through the federal HealthCare.gov website dipped by 5 percent last year, while states running their own enrollment effort maintained their sign-up levels. A total of 11.7 million people enrolled for 2018 coverage, with about 85 percent receiving subsidies to help pay their premiums. The report validated a longtime Republican criticism that high premiums discourage consumers from signing up for coverage. But it also found that Trump contributed to premium increases for 2018 by canceling payments that reimburse insurers for lower deductibles and copays provided to low-income people. That forced the carriers to jack up rates. \"Substantial increases\" in premiums triggered by Trump cut both ways, the watchdog found. People with modest incomes entitled to subsidies got more financial aid from the government, and their coverage became more affordable. But solid middle-class customers paying full premiums were priced out of the market.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Stacey Abrams Wednesday in her bid to become Georgia's first Democratic governor in 15 years and the nation's first-ever black female state executive. The former vice president hailed Abrams in a statement to The Associated Press for her \"track record of building consensus across party lines\" while still advancing Democratic priorities like Medicaid expansion and public education.\u00a0 In an interview with the AP, Abrams said Biden's backing \"continues to reflect the broad and diverse coalition that I'm attempting to build\" in a GOP-dominated state. Biden joined other potential 2020 presidential candidates including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California in backing Abrams. Though Abrams, a former state House floor leader, has been buoyed by high-profile supporters and campaign contributions from liberals across the country, she's still expected to be a decided underdog this fall. She's awaiting the results of a July 24 runoff between Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp to learn who she'll face in the general election. No Democratic candidate for governor, U.S. Senate or president has prevailed in Georgia since 1998. Abrams and Biden might seem like unlikely political partners. But the 44-year-old Atlanta attorney and the 75-year-old former vice president are forming a campaign alliance that could make perfect sense for both politicians and a Democratic Party that's still looking for the right counter arguments in era of President Donald Trump. She's styled herself as an unapologetic progressive \u2014 a nod to a Georgia electorate that is becoming younger, more urban and less-white, but still includes large swaths of white voters beyond metro Atlanta who've abandoned Democrats in recent decades. Biden, who prides himself on being a middle-class advocate who connects even with many Trump voters, can boost that argument, Abrams says. She adds that she has no qualms about accepting support from national Democrats with styles and policy preferences as different as Biden and Sanders, an icon of the activist left. For Biden, the alliance puts him on record alongside one of the party's high-profile up-and-comers who has an opportunity to make history. It also signals to any reticent Georgia Democrats that Abrams deserves full party support. Abrams won a May 22 primary over Stacey Evans, another former state legislator, by almost a 3-to-1 margin. But Evans had enjoyed backing of many old-guard Democratic Party figures, most of whom were white. Evans quickly endorsed Abrams after the primary ballots were counted. Beyond Georgia, many of Biden's endorsements in the 2018 midterms have come in GOP-leaning territory, though his aides stress that he is not trying to take an absolute side on specific ideological battles within the party. That means he's backed House candidates like Pennsylvania's Conor Lamb, who pointedly opposes sweeping new gun restrictions, but also Texan Gina Ortiz Jones, who supports a single-payer, government-run health insurance system.",

            "article_content": "BERLIN -- The co-leader of the far-right nationalist Alternative for Germany party on Saturday dismissed the Nazi era as a \"speck of bird poop\" in German history, drawing swift condemnation from mainstream politicians and outrage on social media. Alexander Gauland said Germans must take responsibility for 12 years of rule by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi party, but argued that it's only a small part of Germany's history.  \"We have a glorious history and it, dear friends, lasted longer than those blasted 12 years,\" he told a gathering of the party's youth movement, according to the dpa news agency.  \"Hitler and the Nazis are just a speck of bird poop in more than 1,000 years of successful German history,\" he said to applause.  The party, known by its German acronym AfD, became the third largest in Germany's parliament after the 2017 election. It is also the largest opposition party.  Responding to Gauland, the secretary general of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Party, wrote on Twitter that \"50 million victims of war, the Holocaust and total war are just bird poop\" for Gauland and his party.  Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said Gauland's comments reveal the true nature of a party hiding behind middle-class respectability.  Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt of the Greens party called Gauland's comments a slap in the face to Holocaust survivors and their descendants and said they highlight the need to push back against a hate-filled minority.  \"Those who say they understand the concerns of AfD voters haven't understood anything,\" she said.  Marco Buschmann of the Free Democratic Party said politicians who systematically play down the Nazi dictatorship and the Holocaust show how bleak their vision for Germany's future is.  Hitler and his party ruled Germany from 1933-1945, in later years engineering the genocide of Jews in Europe. Millions of people were persecuted or perished under Nazi rule, including six million Jews who lost their lives in the Holocaust.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Cynthia Nixon, a progressive activist and actress best known for playing Miranda on HBO's \"Sex and the City,\" announced Monday that she would challenge New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a Democratic primary.  I love New York, and today I'm announcing my candidacy for governor. Join us: https://t.co/9DwsxWW8xX pic.twitter.com/kYTvx6GZiD Nixon is known as an ally of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who often finds himself at odds with Cuomo, and has been mulling a bid for months. The governor, who was first elected in 2010, is running for a third term. Cuomo faced a stronger-than-expected primary challenge from progressive academic Zephyr Teachout in 2014. He is thought of as a potential candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020.  First, however, he'll have to fend off Nixon, who has largely left acting for activism in recent years. Her announcement video does not mention Cuomo by name, but does knock \"politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us.\"  \"We are now the most unequal state in the entire country,\" Nixon says in the ad, \"with both incredible wealth and extreme poverty.\" De Blasio backed Cuomo in the 2014 primary despite their frequent sparring. However, given his close connections to Nixon, de Blasio is unlikely to support Cuomo this time. Two strategists with ties to de Blasio have joined Nixon's campaign, and Nixon's wife recently left her job as an education adviser in the mayor's administration.  Nixon would be the first gay person and first woman to be governor of New York. But Cuomo, who has raised some $30 million for the race, will be tough opponent to beat. Polls indicate he is rather popular in the state, and enjoys what amounts to universal name recognition.  Still, Cuomo is thought by some to be vulnerable, in large part due his rocky relationship with progressives. For most of his tenure, Cuomo developed a working alliance with Republicans in the state senate, and marketed himself as a moderate on economic issues.  Since winning reelection in 2014, Cuomo has hewed a bit to the left. He has, for example, championed a program that allows some middle-class New Yorkers to attend public college for free. However, progressives argue that he has fallen short on his promises, while his feud with de Blasio has only intensified.  The Democratic primary is set to occur in September.",

            "article_content": "Pushing the Republican tax package through Congress was only half the battle for President Donald Trump. Now that it's the law, convincing Americans that it was a good idea is not just a political imperative but an economic one, too. To boost GOP prospects in the midterm elections, Trump needs to show that Republicans are delivering on long-promised tax relief. And to meet the ambitious economic growth projections underpinning the law, the White House needs businesses and ordinary Americans to boost their spending in response to the tax changes. Aiming to advance both goals, the administration is deploying Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Cabinet officials and staff throughout the country to anchor events publicizing the law and its benefits to workers and employers. As part of that sales effort, Trump on Wednesday welcomed to the White House seven representatives of companies that have passed on the benefits of the tax law to their employees. \"It is not crumbs,\" Trump said after the employees described using the bonuses they've received to fund a wedding, a vacation, and retirement. It was a subtle brush-back to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's effort to use the word to minimize the scale of the bonuses. Pence, at the same time, was talking up the tax cuts to workers at a manufacturing company in West Virginia. The law provides steep tax cuts for corporations, with more modest breaks for most Americans \u2014 though some in the middle class from high-taxed states will pay more \u2014 and has suffered in the polls. But the White House hopes that is beginning to change as a parade of businesses announce additional investments in the U.S. or provide income boosts to their employers. The first benefits of the law are just beginning to be felt by everyday taxpayers. Expect a wide-ranging sales pitch. \"The best way to look at how we are going to promote, explain and highlight the benefits of tax reform is to look at how we worked to pass tax reform,\" said White House spokesman Josh Raffel. The charm offensive already is underway: First daughter and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump traveled to South Carolina on Jan. 26 with Republican Sen. Tim Scott to highlight the expansion of the child tax credit under the law to a predominantly female audience. An official said she would engage in more of those events going forward, as she did in the run-up to the law's passage. Inside the West Wing, the White House political office is overlaying the list of companies that have announced new investments or bonuses for their employees on a map of target races in the 2018 midterms, providing an outline for travel in the coming months. The events will be timed to coincide with filing deadlines and other opportunities to highlight how the law is affecting people, officials said. In the coming weeks, Trump is expected to mark increases in many employees' take-home pay as the IRS withholding tables reflecting the law's adjusted rates go into effect by Feb. 15. According to a tally of public announcements by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that supported the tax law, about 3 million workers have gotten bonuses, raises or larger payments to their retirement accounts since the tax law was signed. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated that the $1.5 trillion law would increase gross domestic product by 1.7 percentage points over a decade. And fiscal hawks have expressed optimism that accelerating economic growth \u2014 and subsequent revenues \u2014 will cut into the legislation's cost. At the White House Wednesday, Trump highlighted companies that have raised the minimum wage they pay workers or that have brought billions back to the U.S. from overseas. \"We also have massive investments coming in,\" he said. A White House tally shows at least 275 companies have increased wages, announced bonuses or promised new hires since the law's passage \u2014 a pace Trump said surprised him. \"We didn't know this was going to happen so much,\" he said Wednesday. The White House is not actively organizing the highly publicized announcements from the likes of Apple and Walmart. Instead, the administration casts them as a \"free-market response\" to the law. Tony Sayegh, the assistant treasury secretary for public affairs, said the announcements are \"helping shift so much of the misinformation that was put out there.\" \"We knew all along that this is exactly what you would see happening if we got the policy right, and we got the policy right,\" said Sayegh. Outside groups that promoted the law are lining up to help the White House sell it. Jay Timmons, the president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, said \"now it's up to business to deliver\" on the promises they made as they advocated for their tax breaks. His group has asked its 14,000 members for data on how the legislation has improved their businesses and the lives of their employees, and is preparing to share it with the White House and congressional leadership. \"Our manufacturers are feeling optimistic,\" Timmons said, adding that the White House effort would only help their efforts.",

Interviewed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Sperling offered a critical assessment of Trump's much anticipated speech to the gathering. The keynote by the U.S. president proved to be a toned-down version of the economic populism and trade protectionism that Trump delivered along the campaign trail leading up to his success in the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0 \"While he was not as perhaps divisive as he may have been in other speeches, I also don't think he did much to give a sense that he understands that you can be for America and believe that cooperating with the rest of the world is positive for everybody,\" said Sperling, who advised the Clinton and Obama administrations.\u00a0 Many global leaders and citizens view Trump \"as somebody who sees the world as a zero-sum game, where any benefit for one country comes at the expense of another,\" he added. That said, Sperling voiced support for the president's stance in regards to Beijing, saying the U.S. is justified in \"fighting against unfair trade practices by China,\" which includes allegations involving the dumping of steel and aluminum. \"One area where I probably do have a little bit of agreement with Donald Trump is I do believe we needed to be tougher on China, on trade, so I do support that,\" said Sperling. \"We should take a tougher line with China.\" During Trump's first year in office, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has taken on an increasingly prominent role in shaping U.S. relations with China, overtaking the more accommodating views of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and economic adviser Gary Cohn. Still, the Trump administration should signal that it is willing to play by the rules and should avoid a reckless decision such as \"pulling out of NAFTA, as opposed to trying to improve it,\" contended Sterling. And, while there was concern that Trump's \"America First\" message would not go over well among the globalist club of corporate elites in Davos, the recent $1.5 trillion tax cut found a receptive audience. In Sterling's view, the legislation simply allows the largest U.S. companies to buy back more stock, increase dividends and offer one-time bonuses to their employees. He noted, \"These workers could have done a lot better if [lawmakers] had simply given all of the tax cut directly to the middle class.\" \"Davos may be a place where that tax cut is most popular because some of the greatest beneficiaries are here,\" he said, adding: \"I don't think in the long term it's going to be a good thing for our country.\"",

No matter what you may have said during the campaign about changing Congress, hire enough Hill veterans to make the office run smoothly. And make sure the person answering the phone sounds like folks from back home. That's only some of the advice headed for the historic class of House freshmen of both major political parties streaming into Washington this week for orientation on the nuts and bolts underpinning a job like none other. Under tight security, new members and their staffs pulled up in front of a hotel about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the Capitol on Tuesday. A bank of cameras and a table marked \"luggage drop-off\" awaited their arrivals in the morning chill. \"I'm just trying to figure out what's going on,\" said Rep.-elect Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., a former member of the state legislature. \"I figure that we're the small fish in a very big pond right now.\" They are a younger generation of lawmakers \u2014 including a record number of women \u2014 arriving flush with victory and optimism. The Democrats are ready to take on President Donald Trump in the biggest and most diverse class of new lawmakers since Watergate. \"I hope that we are ushering in a new era,\" one of the class stars, Massachusetts Rep.-elect Ayanna Pressley, said Monday. They are psyched \u2014 if not exactly unified. Even among the new Democrats, there's an uncomfortable vote looming on whether Rep. Nancy Pelosi, former speaker of the House, should lead them. Rep.-elect Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., on Monday became the latest House Democrat newcomer to say she won't vote for Pelosi because she wants \"new leadership.\" Pelosi has said she expects to become speaker again. Pressley and several of her classmates made their Washington debut on Monday in a packed news conference whose setting suggested as much about the new majority's intentions as the agenda they described. Gathered in the atrium of the AFL-CIO down the street from the White House, they appeared as the newest members of the ascendant House Progressive Caucus, dedicated to universal health care and new climate policy. The incoming majority, including a gain of at least 32 seats, will be fighting a Republican-led Senate and a president with a history of tweeting trouble for people who displease him. And the newly elected Republicans are on the same side as Trump, at least in theory. But for both parties of newcomers, those big questions are for later. The first votes on Pelosi, for example, won't unfold until after Thanksgiving. And the new Congress, the 116th session, doesn't convene until Jan. 3. Now, for many newcomers, it's a scramble to stand up offices in the warren of Capitol Hill and back home in House districts that each represent more than 700,000 people. Every office has a budget. And every freshman who doesn't already have a home in pricey Washington will have to figure out how to rent an apartment, or maybe just keep a rollaway bed in the office, on a $174,000 salary. \"We focus on getting them to appreciate that there are certain activities that they have to do in the next 90 days,\" said Bradford Fitch, president and CEO of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Congressional Management Foundation, which is among those briefing new members. The new crop of lawmakers includes a lot of firsts. For the first time, two Native American women are headed to the House, in addition to two Muslim congresswomen-elect. Massachusetts and Connecticut also will send black women to Congress as firsts for their states. But not every freshman is new to Washington. Rep.-elect Donna Shalala of Florida was health and human services secretary to President Bill Clinton. Former NFL linebacker Colin Allred of Texas is a civil rights lawyer who worked in President Barack Obama's housing department. Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, is an Obama administration alumnus who served as a civilian adviser in Iraq. Whatever their background, every newly elected member is heading for a job as one of 435 colleagues in Washington juggling what can sometimes be a seven-day-a-week job of votes, constituent requests and committee meetings. All the while, those who intend to return are already thinking about \u2014 and soon will be fundraising for \u2014 their 2020 re-election campaigns. But first things first, Fitch said. At the progressive caucus briefing for new members on Monday, he handed out a 300-page book, \"Setting Course: A Congressional Management Guide,\" updated for the incoming Congress. It sets out everything from hiring a core staff in November and December to the culture of Congress. Chapter One talks about Dos and Don'ts of these first days. Do learn to delegate, for example. Don't \"skip the House/Senate orientations and party organizational activities.\" And don't \"try to do everything.\" During this period, \"they don't have to come up with a solution to the Middle East crisis,\" Fitch said.",

Biden himself is more conflicted \u2014 but he is listening keenly to the supporters pushing him to run for the White House in 2020. Biden is convinced he can beat President Donald Trump, friends and advisers say, and he has given himself until January to deliberate and size up potential competition for the Democratic nomination, according to people who have spoken to the former vice president about his decision-making.

Mr. Trump\u00a0quickly fired back, saying the former vice president \"would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.\" Mr. Trump has since said that running against Biden in 2020 would be a \"dream\", telling \"CBS Evening News\"' Jeff Glor that former President Obama \"took him out of the garbage heap.\" In the meantime, Biden diligently maintains a network of supporters in key states, a group 30 years in the making, while some of those competitors are still making introductions. As he takes each careful step, Biden faces the same dilemma. For an elder statesman in a leaderless party, one who long envisioned himself in the top job, the pull toward another presidential bid is strong. But the 75-year-old former vice president must weigh the realities of jumping into a crowded primary full of up-and-comers eager to debate the future of the party. \"He is not someone who needs to run to cement his place in history. He's not someone who needs to run to feel he's making a significant contribution to the public discourse and the Democratic Party,\" said Anita Dunn, a former adviser to President Barack Obama. \"But he is someone who, at the end of the day, feels a great deal of responsibility to listen to those people who are urging him to run.\" Biden would likely cast a long shadow, but a candidate Biden is not expected to clear what will be a crowded field of aspiring presidents in 2020. He would have competition for the support of the Democratic establishment. And he would almost certainly face tough challenges from the left \u2014 the source of much of the party's energy at the moment \u2014 possibly from liberal firebrands Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Biden would likely cast himself as a more centrist Democrat with working-class appeal, bipartisan credentials and grounding in a more civil political culture that has faded in the Trump era, said Jim Margolis, a top adviser to Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaigns. \"He would carry the imprimatur of the Obama administration in addition to occupying a space in the middle that isn't as crowded as others who are more actively running,\" said Margolis. He hit those themes gently at a memorial service for his late Senate colleague, Republican John McCain, last week. \"I always thought of John as a brother,\" Biden said. \"We had a hell of a lot of family fights.\" Biden has eyed the presidency for more than 30 years, waging a failed campaign for the party nomination in 1988 and again in 2008, before Obama named him his running mate. He passed on running again in 2016 as he dealt with his son Beau's battle with brain cancer. The younger Biden died in March 2015, as the Democratic campaign was taking shape. Since leaving the vice president's office he has emerged as among the party's most popular national figures, and one of its most willing Trump adversaries. Biden is in regular talks with a small team of longtime friends and advisers. He also talks to potential donors and longtime staff about the possibility of another campaign. However, he has also signaled to them they are free to ally with other prospective candidates, as he eyes a January timeframe for deciding on whether to run, according to three people familiar with Biden's thinking who spoke to The Associated Press about his plans on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. That leaves Biden for the next two months as one of his party's most sought-after 2018 campaign headliners. He plans to make multiple campaign stops a week this fall for Democratic candidates, according to people familiar with the plans. \"As the vice president has said many times himself, he is focused on electing as many Democrats as possible all across the country and on encouraging people to get out and vote this fall,\" Biden adviser Kate Bedingfield said. \"That's the focus of his energy right now.\" Biden's choices so far have shown off his deep ties to key early states. He has campaigned for a young former aide now running for Congress in northeastern Iowa, a part of the state with enduring personal loyalty to Biden but that swung toward Mr. Trump in 2016. He recently penned an op-ed in The Des Moines Register eulogizing the late Rep. Leonard Boswell, an act that was not political but at the family's request, according to aides. In South Carolina, Biden endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor, as well as longtime friend and former South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian, a state Senate candidate. \"If he wants, the day he says he wants to be running for president, he would have a built-in network here,\" Harpootlian said. \"He's got friends here going back 30 years.\" Not all early-state party activists are clamoring for Biden Part III. What's left of his New Hampshire network, for instance, is fragmented, aging and undecided heading into 2020, said John Broderick, state chairman of Biden's first campaign. Though Broderick, now 70, said his own family would gladly support Biden again, many in Biden's New Hampshire support network \"are getting longer in the tooth like I am.\" Likewise, Iowa Democrat Mary Maloney, a leading campaign activist for both of Biden's campaigns, said she would support him, but wondered if younger voters would roll their eyes at yet another Baby Boomer candidate. \"I don't know if a lot of young people get Joe Biden,\" said Maloney, who is 63. For that reason, Biden certainly wouldn't block younger prospects from stepping forward, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley said. \"There's a lot of young talent within the party that would like to run themselves,\" he said. All that aside, Margolis, who is in touch with Biden's team, said, \"I'm pretty confident that he and his closest advisers legitimately believe he has a real shot at this.\" Aboard the same New York shuttle in July, Margolis witnessed the unscripted reaction Biden received. \"Just watching on the plane, one after another coming up to him,\" Margolis said. \"Joe Biden was the happiest guy in the world.\"",

            "article_content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A prominent human rights activist in Bahrain was sentenced Wednesday to five years in prison over tweets alleging prison torture in his country and misconduct in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, despite wide international criticism of his trial. Nabeel Rajab's sentencing marks the latest chapter in a years-long crackdown on dissent in Bahrain, a tiny island kingdom off the coast of Saudi Arabia that's home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet. He's already serving a two-year sentence handed down in July over television interviews he gave that included criticism of Bahrain. Rajab has been hospitalized several times during his most-recent incarceration over heart problems and ulcers. Rajab's Twitter account posted a message Wednesday saying he entered court with a \"cheerful smile\" before his sentencing. After his sentencing, he raised his hands making a peace sign and laughed. The court's decision drew immediate condemnation from activists. \"It's time the Trump administration showed some spine in standing up to the dictatorship in Bahrain,\" said Brian Dooley, a senior adviser at the U.S. -based group Human Rights First. \"It should take punitive action over this verdict and send the American ambassador to visit Rajab in prison to tell him that the U.S. is on his side and against this reckless repression.\" Western diplomats were on hand for Rajab's trial Wednesday in Manama, Bahrain's capital. Bahraini officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bahrain's constitution guarantees its citizens freedom of speech. Rajab's legal problems began after Bahrain quashed 2011 Arab Spring protests. In August 2012, Rajab was sentenced to three years in prison for allegedly fomenting clashes between police and protesters. He already was serving a three-month sentence for posting anti-government comments on Twitter. He was released in May 2014 after serving two years, but was detained again over his comments on Twitter. Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa pardoned Rajab in July 2015 over concerns about his health after the activist served some three months in prison. But Rajab was again arrested in June 2016. Bahrain, a nation only some 290 square miles in size, is home to some 1.4 million people. About half are Bahraini citizens, the majority of them Shiite. The island has been ruled since 1783 by the Sunni Al Khalifa family. King Hamad, who took the throne in 1999, initially took steps to move the country from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one. The first parliamentary elections since 1973 were held in 2002. However, its Shiite majority accused the government of treating them like second-class citizens. They joined pro-democracy activists in demanding more political freedoms in 2011 as Arab Spring protests swept the wider Middle East. Saudi and Emirati troops ultimately helped violently put down the demonstrations. Amid this recent crackdown, local Shiite militant groups have carried out several attacks on security forces. Independent news gathering in Bahrain also has grown more difficult, with the government refusing to accredit two Associated Press reporters and others while shutting down a prominent local independent newspaper. America has faced criticism over its stance on Bahrain, which hosts over 7,000 U.S. troops, mostly sailors attached to a sprawling base called the Naval Support Activity in Manama. President Donald Trump's administration has approved a multibillion-dollar sale of F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain without the human rights conditions imposed by the State Department under President Barack Obama. At a briefing Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert described Rajab as a \"prominent human rights activist\" and said American officials were \"disappointed\" by his recent convictions. \"We continue to have conversations with the government of Bahrain about our very serious concerns,\" she said.",

Facing a challenging political map that requires Democrats to defend 26 Senate seats, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee  chairman, is hoping that healthcare will be a winning message for the party this fall.\u00a0 Some in the party are promoting a single-payer, Medicare-for-all heathcare system, but Van Hollen seemed to suggest that it's a proposal that may be too narrow for the midterms. \"The idea of making sure we have universal coverage is definitely something that has broad support in the country. How exactly you get there is a matter of debate and discussion, including the Democratic caucus,\" he said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Thursday,\u00a0 Van Hollen attempted to minimize any divisions within the party over whether to support single-payer or to expand existing Affordable Care Act (ACA) provisions, saying that while there is \"a very broad spectrum of views\" within the caucus, Democrats are unified on the need to make prescription drugs more affordable and to stop Medicare and Medicaid cuts. The DSCC chairman also said that Senate Democrats would \"welcome support\" from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in the 2018 midterm elections. Although he noted that the DSCC does not make those decisions and that it's up to the individual campaigns to decide who they want involved, Van Hollen said, \"As the head of the DSCC, we welcome those individuals and everybody who wants to help.\" In the past couple of weeks, Hillary Clinton has been stepping up her involvement in the 2018 midterms \u2013 she spoke at the DNC Women's Leadership Forum, and she endorsed New York Gov.

            "article_content": "Some Medicare beneficiaries would pay more for their prescription drugs under President Donald Trump's budget even as the sickest patients save thousands of dollars, a complex trade-off that may make it harder to sell Congress on the plan in an election year. In budget documents, the administration said its proposals strike a balance between improving the popular \"Part D\" prescription benefit for the 42 million seniors enrolled, while correcting design flaws that increase program costs for taxpayers. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is expected to testify on the proposal later this week in Congress. Trump has made bringing down drug costs a top priority, but his administration's plan would create winners and losers. The high cost of medicines is the leading health care concern among consumers. Independent experts said the administration's plan will help beneficiaries with the highest prescription drug costs, an estimated 1 million of the sickest patients, those whose individual bills reach a total of more than $8,418 apiece. But about 4.5 million seniors in the group just behind them could end up spending more of their own money. That's because the budget proposes a change in how Medicare accounts for manufacturer discounts received by patients whose total bills range between $3,750 and $8,418. They could wind up paying about $1,000 more. A senior Senate Democrat said the Trump plan missed the mark. \"Instead of picking winners and losers and leaving big pharma unscathed, the president should follow through on his promise to lower high drug prices by getting Republicans in Congress to work with Democrats on behalf of Americans who are getting clobbered at the pharmacy counter,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement. Wyden is the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, which oversees Medicare. \"The package reduces costs for some but increases costs for others, and the effect on premiums is not clear,\" said Tricia Neuman, a Medicare expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Also unclear is how the Trump plan interacts with changes to the Medicare prescription plan enacted by Congress just last week. Medicare's prescription drug benefit is delivered through private insurance plans. Here's more detail on the trade-off for beneficiaries: \u2014 The budget eliminates cost sharing for Medicare beneficiaries who reach the program's \"catastrophic\" coverage threshold, currently $8,418 in total costs. Instead of paying 5 percent of the cost of their medications, the sickest patients would pay nothing. They'd be the winners. \u2014 A second group just behind the sickest patients would lose ground financially. Currently Medicare counts manufacturer discounts received by patients in this group to calculate total spending that determines when they qualify for catastrophic coverage. That practice would stop, meaning beneficiaries would have to spend more of their own money to reach the threshold for the richer catastrophic coverage. \"It's complicated,\" said Joe Baker of the Medicare Rights Center. \"The winners in this proposal are people with very high drug spending. The people who are the losers here are the people who are stuck in the middle.\" In other Medicare drug changes, the budget calls for requiring insurers to share manufacturer rebates with patients, and it expands coverage for medications to treat substance abuse.",

            "article_content": "Cheered on by a handful of activists, liberal House Democrats announced outside the Capitol that they were forming a caucus to push for \"Medicare for All\" \u2014 shorthand for government-financed health care. At the same time Thursday, Democratic senators were introducing a resolution aimed at putting Republicans on the defensive about Trump administration efforts to undermine former President Barack Obama's health care law. Neither proposal has much chance of going anywhere in the Republican-run House or Senate. But the bigger problem for Democrats is that the two messages \u2014 fundamentally reshaping the nation's health care system versus defending Obama's popular law \u2014 divide the party as it tries grabbing control of Congress in this fall's elections. All Democrats oppose President Donald Trump's repeated efforts to scuttle Obama's Affordable Care Act, and many have backed expanding government-paid health care, including Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. But many also think drawing campaign-season attention to Democratic efforts to reinvent the country's $3 trillion-a-year health care system, a costly and complex undertaking, is a mistake. Promoting \"Medicare for All\" opens the door for Republicans to accuse Democrats of plotting tax increases, unaffordable federal costs and the loss of employer-provided coverage, these Democrats argue. They say it's better to play offense by focusing on controlling medical costs and opposing GOP efforts to demolish the 2010 health care law. \"Every Democrat is being asked, 'Do you support this or do you not?' and it's becoming a political wedge in an election year,\" Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., said of the \"Medicare for All\" drive. \"And I think we should be focusing on the terrible things that are happening under this administration right now.\" The new caucus has more than 60 members, nearly 1-in-3 House Democrats, including many from safely blue districts where liberal voters prevail. Backing \"Medicare for All\" lets them tap into activists' fervor for universal health care that helped propel Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders to an unexpectedly strong challenge to Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. \"If you live in America, you've got a right to affordable quality health care, period,\" said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., a caucus founder, prompting applause from supporters watching her group's news conference Thursday. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., another leader, later said she backs a 2017 House bill providing free health care financed partly by boosting taxes on wealthy Americans. That bill has more than 120 Democratic co-sponsors. But she said her group's goal is to build consensus for legislation it may introduce next year, with decisions remaining about costs, financing and other questions. A similar bill by Sanders last year drew 16 Democratic co-sponsors, including at least four potential 2020 presidential contenders. Sponsors haven't released price tags, but Sanders said a version he promoted during his 2016 campaign would have cost $1.4 trillion annually \u2014 a figure some analysts said was far too low. \"The only proposal here is a 'Medicare for All' caucus to figure out what the right proposal is,\" Jayapal said. That's not stopping the GOP from getting ready to jump on the issue. By combing through candidate and newspaper websites, social media and other sources, Republicans have compiled quotes from around two dozen Democratic House challengers embracing \"Medicare for All.\" A Republican provided the information on condition of anonymity to disclose internal preparations. \"It would break Medicare,\" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \"And it would end any private insurance as we know it.\" Trump and congressional Republicans tried repealing the ACA last year and failed. But they've taken incremental whacks at it, including cutting federal subsidies to many insurers, erasing the penalty for people who don't buy insurance and opening the door to low-cost plans providing less coverage. That's exactly where many Democrats running in swing districts are concentrating their messages. Democrat Clarke Tucker, challenging Arkansas GOP Rep. French Hill, said in an early TV ad, \"I'll stand up to anyone who tries to take your health care.\" And Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., said in an interview, \"I'd say we ought to focus on Republican efforts to undermine the ACA right now and the impact that's had on costs going up.\" That was also the focus for Democratic senators in their resolution Thursday authorizing the Senate's legal counsel to intervene in a lawsuit in which 20 GOP-led states allege the health care law is no longer constitutional. The Trump administration said last month it will stop defending key parts of the law in court, including provisions protecting patients with pre-existing medical conditions. Polls show large majorities favor helping those consumers. Democrats want the Senate counsel to defend the protections for people with pre-existing problems. There's little chance Republicans controlling the Senate will allow such a vote, which Democrats hope would put GOP senators in an uncomfortable position. \"This is a test of the Republican Party, whether or not they are going to do the right thing,\" said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for all\" plan would increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, according to a study by a university-based libertarian policy center. That's trillion with a \"T.\" The latest plan from the Vermont independent would require historic tax increases as government replaces what employers and consumers now pay for health care, according to the analysis being released Monday by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia. It would deliver significant savings on administration and drug costs, but increased demand for care would drive up spending, the analysis found. Sanders' plan builds on Medicare, the popular insurance program for seniors. All U.S. residents would be covered with no copays and deductibles for medical services. The insurance industry would be relegated to a minor role. \"Enacting something like 'Medicare for all' would be a transformative change in the size of the federal government,\" said Charles Blahous, the study's author. Blahous was a senior economic adviser to former President George W. Bush and a public trustee of Social Security and Medicare during the Obama administration. Responding to the study, Sanders took aim at the Mercatus Center, which receives funding from the conservative Koch brothers. Koch Industries CEO Charles Koch is on the center's board. \"If every major country on earth can guarantee health care to all, and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita than we do, it is absurd for anyone to suggest that the United States cannot do the same,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"This grossly misleading and biased report is the Koch brothers response to the growing support in our country for a 'Medicare for all' program.\" Sanders' office has not done a cost analysis, a spokesman said. However, the Mercatus estimates are within the range of other cost projections for Sanders' 2016 plan. Sanders' staff found an error in an initial version of the Mercatus report, which counted a long-term care program that was in the 2016 proposal but not the current one. Blahous corrected it, reducing his estimate by about $3 trillion over 10 years. Blahous says the report is his own work, not the Koch brothers'. Also called \"single-payer\" over the years, \"Medicare for all\" reflects a long-time wish among liberals for a government-run system that covers all Americans. The idea won broad rank-and-file support after Sanders ran on it in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. Looking ahead to the 2020 election, Democrats are debating whether single-payer should be a \"litmus test\" for national candidates. The Mercatus analysis estimated the 10-year cost of \"Medicare for all\" from 2022 to 2031, after an initial phase-in. Its findings are similar to those of several independent studies of Sanders' 2016 plan. Those studies found increases in federal spending over 10 years that ranged from $24.7 trillion to $34.7 trillion. Kenneth Thorpe, a health policy professor at Emory University in Atlanta, authored one of those studies and says the Mercatus analysis reinforces them. \"It's showing that if you are going to go in this direction, it's going to cost the federal government $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion a year in terms of spending,\" said Thorpe. \"Even though people don't pay premiums, the tax increases are going to be enormous. There are going to be a lot of people who'll pay more in taxes than they save on premiums.\" Thorpe was a senior health policy adviser in the Clinton administration. The Mercatus study takes issue with a key cost-saving feature of the plan \u2014 that hospitals and doctors will accept payment based on lower Medicare rates for all their patients. The study found that the plan would reap substantial savings from lower prescription costs \u2014 $846 billion over 10 years \u2014 since the government would deal directly with drugmakers. Savings from streamlined administration would be even greater, nearly $1.6 trillion. But other provisions would tend to drive up spending, including coverage for nearly 30 million uninsured people, no deductibles and copays, and improved benefits, including dental, vision and hearing. After taking into account current government health care financing, the study estimated that doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes would not fully cover the additional costs.",

            "article_content": "\u00a0A major liberal policy group is raising the ante on the health care debate with a new plan that builds on Medicare to guarantee coverage for all. Called \"Medicare Extra for All,\" the proposal to be released Thursday by the Center for American Progress gives politically energized Democrats more options to achieve a long-sought goal. Still, the plan would preserve a role for employer coverage and for the health insurance industry. Employers and individuals would have a choice of joining Medicare Extra, but it would not be required. That differs from the more traditional \"single-payer\" approach advocated by Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, in which the government would hold the reins of the health care system. Even though the plan has no chance of passing in a Republican-controlled Congress, center president Neera Tanden said, \"We think it's time to go bolder. There is consensus on the progressive side that universal coverage should be the goal and health care is a right.\" Picking up on the leftward shift among Democrats, Republicans are already working up rebuttals. President Donald Trump tweeted earlier this month that \"Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!\" The Center for American Progress is a think tank that was closely aligned with President Barack Obama and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. A 2005 proposal from the center foreshadowed Obama's Affordable Care Act. Medicare Extra would use Medicare's thrifty payment system as framework to pool working-age people and their families, low-income people now covered by Medicaid, and seniors. A major missing piece: There's no cost estimate for the plan, although its authors say that's in the works. The proposal comes at a time when polls show intense interest among Democrats and some independents in a government-run system that would guarantee coverage and benefits while reducing the complexity and out-of-pocket costs associated with private insurance. The future of health care is expected to be a defining issue in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, and political messages will be tested and honed in this fall's midterm elections. A nonpartisan expert who independently reviewed the Medicare Extra plan said it could provide Democrats with a middle way to achieve their longstanding goal of coverage for all. \"It's an attempt to capture the enthusiasm for a single-payer system among the Democratic base, but trying to create a more politically and fiscally realistic roadmap,\" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. To be sure, taxes would rise and the federal government would take on a larger role. \"It is in some ways 'repeal and replace,' but from the left rather than the right,\" Levitt added. Medicare Extra envisions a complex transition that would take the better part of a decade. Among its major elements: \u2014All U.S. citizens and lawful residents would be automatically eligible for coverage. \u2014Preventive care, treatment for chronic disease, and generic prescription drugs would be free. Dental, vision and hearing services would be included. \u2014Low-income people would pay no premiums or copays. Premiums and cost-sharing would be determined according to income for everyone else. \u2014Employers would have the option of maintaining their own plans or joining Medicare Extra. Workers could pick the government plan over their employer's. The proposal would preserve the tax-free status of employer-provided health care, subject to a limit. \u2014Seniors with private Medicare Advantage insurance plans through Medicare would be able to keep similar coverage, although the program would be redesigned and called \"Medicare Choice.\" Seniors would gain coverage for vision, dental and hearing services not now provided by Medicare. Long-term care services would be covered. \u2014Government would negotiate prices for prescription drugs, medical devices and medical equipment. Although costs and financing are not spelled out in the proposal, its authors acknowledge significant tax increases would be required. Options include rolling back some of the recently enacted GOP tax cuts for corporations and upper-income people, raising Medicare taxes on upper-income earners, and higher taxes on tobacco and sugary soft drinks.",

            "article_content": "A divided American electorate, already shattering voting records for midterm elections, will decide control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday. That's making investors more jittery than usual ahead of the final vote counts. A renegotiated and renamed North American Free Trade Agreement will need Congressional approval. Also potentially on the legislative agenda are enormous economic issues like another income tax cut, rising drug prices, a substitute for Obamacare, federal spending increases (or cuts) and a ballooning public deficit fueled by the last GOP income tax cut.  \"Most of my days are spent talking to clients about what are the polls showing, which way are the winds blowing, what could the implications be. This, of course, touches on everything: trade policy, infrastructure, the Fed raising interest rates,\" Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, told CBS MoneyWatch. Betting markets, as well as polls from CBS News and other outlets, indicate the House of Representatives is likely to swing to a Democratic majority, with the GOP keeping a slim margin in the Senate.  Whatever happens on Tuesday, here is how the results are likely to play out in major areas of the economy. A dismal October wiped out most of the market's gains this year, while an elevated VIX, an index that measures market volatility, suggests more day-to-day mayhem is possible. The good news is that the stock market jitters will likely end as soon as the midterms do\u2014regardless of who the winners are. Research shows that historically, nearly every U.S. election since the World War II has been followed by a so-called relief rally, where stocks rise at least modestly. \"Historically, stock market volatility increased ahead of the elections due to policy uncertainty. However, stocks also tended to rebound strongly coming out of midterm election-year lows,\" LPL Financial wrote in a research note last month. \"We are now entering the most favorable part of the four-year presidential cycle.\" Tariffs and trade are finding their way into the elections, too. Though the White House renegotiated a trade agreement to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, Congress\u00a0must approve it \u2014 something that becomes less certain with a Democratic-controlled House in January. And the effects of Mr. Trump's already imposed and threatened tariffs on steel and aluminum, cars and trucks, and goods from China are seeping into corporate finances large and small. Millions of jobs are at stake, and prices are rising\u00a0for consumer goods from autos to food to\u00a0televisions. \"It comes down to what can be done with executive orders and what has to go through Congress,\" Deutsche Bank's Slok said. \"Congress will probably play a bigger role in trade policy. The majority in the House will probably start showing more interest in trade policy.\" Congress controls the nation's purse strings. That, Slok notes, could produce \"quite a changed landscape in what's possible with Congress.\" If Democrats gain control of the House, or even the Senate, gridlock will almost certainly ensue. That threatens President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda, a proposed second round of tax cuts, infrastructure spending, or potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare entitlements.  Still, a Democratic Congress would be hard-pressed to \"undo the major market-impactful legislation that has already been passed,\" UBS analysts note in a recent report. Many key regulations have been undone, and Mr. Trump retains the power to veto any Congressional legislation.  \"With the economy already operating close to its full potential, and concerns mounting over further pro-cyclical fiscal measures, it's less important for Congress to be able to easily pass major legislation, including additional tax cuts that could further widen the deficit,\" UBS wrote. In that scenario, split-party control could be good for the markets, since it reduces the chance of any major legislation becoming law and unintentionally harming the economy. But if gridlock reaches the levels it did in 2011, causing government shutdowns or another crisis over the debt ceiling, the opposite would likely happen. During the 2011 episode, when the U.S. Treasury came close to a technical default on its debt, the S&P 500 dropped by nearly 20 percent. A repeat of this scenario \"is not only possible but could actually become likely in an extreme gridlock environment,\" according to UBS.  Infrastructure \u2014 the catch-all phrase for big construction projects from highways and subways to water systems to the electric grid \u2014 may get a boost no matter what the election's outcome, according to UBS. That could come in the form of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill discussed by both sides in the 2016 Presidential contest, even as the deficit balloons over the next few years pay for the Republican-led tax cuts\u00a0of 2017.\u00a0 Both sides regularly say they want infrastructure progress. Vice President Mike Pence told The Hill this week the administration wants to push ahead with infrastructure during the lame-duck session following the election. While Mr. Trump's approach may be different from House Democrats' vision, the shared goal may leave room for a joint effort, \u00a0Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, told the New York Times. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, in an interview last month with CNN and in a tweet, emphasized infrastructure as a priority for the Democrats. \"By and large, infrastructure has always been a bipartisan issue. We can create jobs by investing in new infrastructure projects like our water systems & broadband internet,\" she said in the tweet. Any form of outsized federal spending \u00a0would likely juice the economy even more by spurring investment and hiring. But it will have a downside: rising interest rates. Unless the Democrats can wrangle a partial repeal of last year's tax cuts or institute a new tax on wealthier Americans \u2014 possibilities Wall Street views as unlikely \u2014 further spending will have to be deficit-financed. Meanwhile, the deficit has tripled since 2007, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin recently surpassed his predecessor's record for the amount of of notes and bonds the government issues to fund its debt. The amount of U.S. treasuries on the market by next year will be double the amount in 2017, according to Deutsche Bank's calculations. All that supply is likely to push interest rates even higher, said Slok. \"We see interest rates going up higher, partly as result of the economy doing well, partly as results of more treasuries and partly as a result of the Federal Reserve,\" he said. Higher interest rates are great for savers \u2014 but they can be a significant damper on business growth, since they make it more expensive to fund long-term investment. It also means that when interest rates shift even a little bit, there's \"there's a lot of treasuries behind that,\" said Slok. Already, the fastest-growing part of the federal budget is not new spending \u2014 it's interest payments on the public debt we've already incurred.",

            "article_content": "The GOP is the party of fiscal responsibility no more. That's according to some conservatives who are grappling with a Republican-backed spending binge that threatens to generate trillion-dollar deficits for years to come while staining a cherished pillar of the modern-day Republican Party. While President Donald Trump and his allies hope economic growth may ease future deficits, few fiscal conservatives cheered Monday's release of the president's $4 trillion-plus budget, which would create $7.2 trillion in red ink over the next decade if adopted by Congress. That follows congressional passage of last week's $400 billion spending pact, along with massive tax cuts, which some analysts predict will push deficits to levels not in generations. Deficit hawks in Congress and conservative activists who railed against President Barack Obama's spending plans called the GOP debt explosion \"dangerous,\" \u2033immoral\" and \"a betrayal.\" American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp warned the Republican-controlled Congress not to underestimate the impact of responsible spending for voters. \"If the Republicans in Congress don't realize that spending control is one of the most important issues that our winning coalition cares about, if they are cavalier about spending decisions, I think we do risk our ability to go to the voters and say it matters to have us in the majority,\" he said. The conservative backlash against government spending comes at a delicate moment for Trump's Republican Party. Barely a year into his first term, the populist president has shown inconsistent commitment at best to the three planks that have defined his party since the Reagan era: fiscal responsibility, traditional family values and a strong national defense. With the GOP's fiscal responsibility now in question, the party's commitment to family values also continues to suffer as Trump and some high-profile allies struggle under the weight of repeated allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse. Fiscal discipline has long helped unify an otherwise divided GOP, but that no longer appears to be the case as Republicans brace for a difficult midterm election season. Americans for Prosperity, the political arm of the network backed by the conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, described the recent spending from Trump and Congress \"a far cry from the so-called fiscal responsibility Americans heard on the campaign trail.\" Voters may forgive Trump's spending habits because he's new to Washington, but they will not be as kind to Republicans on the midterm ballots, said David McIntosh, president of the conservative Club for Growth, who lashed out at last week's Republican-backed spending plan as \"of the swamp, by the swamp and for the swamp.\" \"They're not going to give a pass to the Republicans in Congress unless they start doing something to restrain the growth of government,\" he said. \"You can't let (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell and the spenders in the Senate set the agenda this year,\" McIntosh continued. \"Because politically, if they set the agenda, then you're going to see big losses in the House and the Senate.\" All told, Trump's budget plan sees accumulating deficits of $7.2 trillion over the coming decade. And that's assuming Trump's rosy economic predictions come true and Congress follows through \u2014 in an election year \u2014 with politically toxic cuts to social programs, farm subsidies and Medicare providers. The president's spending outline for the first time acknowledges that the Republican tax overhaul passed last year would add billions to the deficit and not \"pay for itself\" as Trump and his Republican allies asserted. If enacted as proposed \u2014 though no presidential budget ever is \u2014 the plan would establish an era of $1 trillion-plus yearly deficits. Trump's spending plan is like \"throwing gasoline on a house that's already on fire,\" said David Biddulph, co-founder of a national organization fighting for a balanced budget amendment. \"I think it's awful what we're doing to our grandkids.\" A self-described fiscal conservative, he blamed the political system more than the Republican Party for the latest spending binge. Yet he encouraged Trump to do more to cut spending on Medicare and Social Security, which he left largely untouched in his budget. If not, Biddulph said, \"I don't know that we'll ever dig our way out of this hole.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump on Friday introduced his blueprint to \"bring soaring drug prices back down to earth.\" Mr. Trump said his administration will begin work immediately, although there is no timeline for implementing his proposals.\u00a0 \"Everyone involved in the broken system -- the drug makers, insurance companies, distributors, pharmacy benefit managers, and many others -- contribute to the problem,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Government has also been part of the problem because previous leaders turned a blind eye to this incredible abuse. But under this administration, we are putting American patients first. ... I've instructed Secretary Azar to begin moving forward on reforms that will bring soaring drug prices back down to Earth.\" In sweeping terms, the president announced how he \u2014 along with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar \u2014 are working to bring down the prices of drugs, by, among other things, ending the \"Pharmacist Gag Rule\" that Mr. Trump said \"punishes\" pharmacists for instructing patients how they can save money. \"This is a total rip off, and we are ending it,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. The president also spoke of ending trade practices abroad that lead to unfair prices for Americans. \"Finally, as we demand fairness for American patients at home, we will also demand fairness overseas,\" Mr. Trump said. \"America will not be cheated any longer, and especially will not be cheated by foreign countries.\"\u00a0 Before taking office last January, Mr. Trump railed against the pharmaceutical industry and accused it of \"getting away with murder.\" He repeated those words at a Cabinet meeting in October.\u00a0 \"The other thing we're doing that relates to people's lives is the prescription drug prices are out of control,\" Mr. Trump said in October. \"The drug prices have gone through the roof. And if you look at the same exact drug by the same exact company, made in the same exact box and sold someplace else, sometimes it's a fraction of what we pay in this country \u2014 meaning, as usual, the world is taking advantage of the United States. They're setting prices in other countries and we're not.\" The populist rhetoric appears to be giving way to a more nuanced strategy focused on making the pharmaceutical market more open and competitive, with the aim of lowering costs for consumers. It's an approach that could avoid a direct confrontation with the powerful pharmaceutical lobby, but it could also underwhelm Americans seeking relief from escalating prescription costs. Officials said the plan would increase competition, create incentives for drugmakers to lower initial prices and slash federal rules that make it harder for private insurers to negotiate lower prices. The result would be lower pharmacy costs for patients \u2014 a key Trump campaign promise. The plan will not include giving the federal Medicare program power to directly negotiate prices with drugmakers, they noted. Trump campaigned on the idea, which is vigorously opposed by the pharmaceutical industry. Public outrage over drug costs has been growing for years, because Americans are being squeezed in a number of ways: New medicines for cancer and other life-threatening diseases often launch with prices exceeding $100,000 per year. Drugs for common ailments like diabetes and asthma routinely see price hikes around 10 percent annually. Meanwhile some companies have been buying up once-cheap older drugs and hiking prices by 1,000 percent or more. Since entering the White House, Mr. Trump has backed away from reforms directly targeting drugmakers and staffed his administration with appointees who have deep ties to the industry, including Azar, a former top executive at Eli Lilly. Still, administration officials ratcheted up the rhetoric ahead of Mr. Trump's speech. Azar promised bold action. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb \u2014 another Trump appointee with industry connections \u2014 hinted at a plan to \"dismantle\" the convoluted system of discounts and rebates between drugmakers and health care middlemen. Members of Congress benefit heavily from the pharmaceutical industry's donations. Top drug companies have donated millions to campaigns and candidates so far in the 2018 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records.\u00a0 On Thursday, administration officials also vowed to address foreign governments that rely on U.S. medicines but pay drastically lower prices due to government controls. The U.S. accounts for 70 percent of the world's brand-name drug profits, according to a White House report released earlier this year. More: Here are some of the drivers of U.S. prescription drug prices, proposals for reducing the costs and what's at stake: Drugmakers generally can charge as much as the market will bear because the U.S. government doesn't regulate medicine prices, unlike most other countries. Medicare is the largest purchaser of prescription drugs in the nation, covering 60 million seniors and Americans with disabilities, but it is barred by law from directly negotiating lower prices with drugmakers. Democrats have long favored giving Medicare that power, but Republicans traditionally oppose the idea. The powerful pharmaceutical lobby has repeatedly fended off proposals that could lower prices, such as Medicare negotiations or importing drugs from countries that regulate pricing. With no direct government price regulation, the primary check on prices comes from buyers in bulk \u2014 such as insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, which handle prescription coverage for insurers, employers and other big clients. But because there are so many players in the fragmented system, the discounts achieved in the U.S. are generally far more modest than those in other countries. The result is that the U.S. spends more on medicines than any other nation. In 2015, the U.S. spent $1,162 per person on pharmaceuticals, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That compares with $756 for Canada and $497 for the United Kingdom, both of which have government measures to control drug prices. The U.S. system for pricing drugs is notoriously complex, so much that the \"real\" price for most medicines isn't clear. Critics contend that this lack of transparency limits competition and drives prices higher. Pharmaceutical companies often launch their drugs with high initial prices. But they argue list prices are merely a starting point for negotiations because they give substantial rebates and discounts to pharmacy benefit managers. Those price concessions are almost never disclosed and it's unclear what portion actually flows back to consumers. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and others say the lack of transparency in the current system creates perverse incentives in which drugmakers and other health care companies benefit from rising prices \u2014 at the expense of patients. Trump officials have suggested requiring Medicare pharmacy benefit managers to share rebate payments with patients. Another proposal would do away with rebates altogether to encourage more upfront discounts in Medicare. But the benefit managers and insurers say that they use rebates to lower health care premiums overall and that doing away with them would drive up costs. Patents last longer in the U.S. than most countries, typically giving companies a dozen years of competition-free marketing after a drug launches. Most drugmakers increase their prices annually during this monopoly period, and until recently double-digit price hikes were the norm. Drugmakers also have developed a number of techniques to block competitors from launching lower-cost generic drugs. Companies often tweak drug formulations to extend their patents. In other cases, companies directly pay would-be competitors to stay off the market in so-called \"pay-to-delay\" deals. Gottlieb has promised a crackdown on some of these techniques used to \"game the system.\" He's highlighted a practice in which drugmakers use tightly controlled distribution systems to prevent rival manufacturers from purchasing their drug. This effectively blocks the development of generic versions because generic drugmakers must test their products against the original medicine before they can win FDA approval.",

Despite historic odds and voter enthusiasm favoring Democrats, the RNC is finding record-setting support among its donors, according to numbers shared first with CBS News. The RNC raised more in July of this year than it did in\u00a02010\u00a0and\u00a02014\u00a0combined. \"We've used our unprecedented grassroots support to build the biggest field program we've ever had to defend our House and Senate majorities,\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News. \"History might be against us, but we're making sure every voter knows we're the party of results.

On Tuesday, President Trump will head to West Virginia, home to one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. Republicans are setting their sights on flipping incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's seat in a state that Mr. Trump won by nearly 42 percentage points in 2016 and where his approval rating remains high. A\u00a0Gallup poll\u00a0following Mr. Trump's first year in office found that he received his highest approval ratings in 2017 from West Virginians. State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who is running against Manchin, is tying himself closely to the president and his policies. His campaign issued a memo this past week saying Mr. Trump's support \"has a larger impact in this race than any Senate race in the country.\" He is welcoming the President to West Virginia with open arms. Manchin, however, is betting that this public embrace will backfire. He and his campaign are hoping to convince West Virginia voters that a vote for Morrisey is a vote against coverage for pre-existing conditions.\u00a0 In a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Mr. Trump touted the administration's steady dismantling of Obamacare, saying, \"And one of the big things is the individual mandate is gone. We got rid of that. That was from Obamacare. That was, by far, the most unpopular thing in Obamacare. We actually got rid of Obamacare, except for one vote. But we essentially have -- so we're doing it piecemeal, and it's going to be gone pretty soon.\" Mr. Trump's comments came the day before Manchin's campaign released\u00a0a new television ad\u00a0attacking Morrisey for joining a lawsuit with state attorneys general targeting the Affordable HealthCare Act (ACA). Manchin argues that if the ACA were to be overturned, 800,000 West Virginians would be at risk of losing coverage for pre-existing conditions. Similarly, other Senate Democrats are hoping this will be a winning message for them this fall. North Dakota's incumbent Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who is also up for re-election in a state that Trump won in 2016, released her own\u00a0television ad\u00a0on pre-existing conditions last week as well, reminding voters that as a breast cancer survivor, she also has a pre-existing condition.\u00a0 And on Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats, including Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Tammy Baldwin who are facing re-election this fall,\u00a0held a hearing\u00a0with Americans they say would be at risk of losing health coverage due to pre-existing conditions if Mr. Trump and Republicans succeed at repealing the ACA. A new\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker poll\u00a0released Sunday found that for voters in battleground House districts, health care is the issue they may be the least willing to compromise on. Three in four say a candidate must agree with them on health care to get their vote. Health care may be more of a make-or-break issue for Democrats. Eighty-four percent of Democrats say a candidate must agree with them on health care to earn their support, compared to 70 percent of Republicans. A \u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0conducted in May 2018, six months ahead of the midterm elections, found that health care tops the list of most important issue for voters, ahead of the economy -- and by two-to-one voters say they've been hurt, not helped, by the GOP's changes to the health care laws. There are two primaries on Tuesday, August 21: Alaska and Wyoming. The Democrats need to flip 23 Republican-held districts to take control of the House of Representatives this fall, and CBS News does not race either of the two House primaries on Tuesday as competitive. Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Young is running for reelection in Alaska's one at-large House seat. On the Democratic side, candidate Carol Hafner is running in the Democratic primary. She is garnering the most attention because she doesn't live in Alaska and has never been to the\u00a0state, but filed to run. She is campaigning for the seat online against challengers Dimitri Shein and Alyse Gavin. Gavin is well-known for her work in advocating for more education funding. Shein is an advocate for a single payer Medicare-for-All health care system. In Wyoming, incumbent Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is running for re-election and faces a primary challenge from\u00a0former cowboy Rod Miller. In Wyoming, incumbent Republican Sen. John Barrasso is expected to advance and win reelection this fall. He has been endorsed by President Trump.\u00a0 But Barrasso has his toughest opponent in a Republican primary in a long time. Businessman Dave Dodson, who does not have much in common with President Trump, has attacked Barrasso for his ties to corporations and Washington, D.C. In\u00a0an interview with the AP, Dodson said he never thought he'd be involved in politics, but he is \"mad\" with its current state. Barrasso also has refused to debate Dodson. There are gubernatorial primaries in both Alaska and Wyoming. In Alaska, the Republican gubernatorial primary is very competitive. It's a crowded field, with seven candidates in the race. The frontrunners are former state Sen. Mike Dunleavy and former Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. According to\u00a0polls, Dunleavy is leading. Mark Begich, the former Democratic senator and former Anchorage mayor, is also challenging incumbent Gov. Bill Walker, who is running as an independent. In Wyoming, six candidates are competing for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, including businessman Foster Friess, state treasurer Mark Gordon, and attorney Harriet Hageman. The seat is expected to stay in Republican hands.",

            "article_content": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Feeling no relief from anti-incumbent Republican primaries, Democratic senators in GOP-leaning states are working to convince voters they're free of Washington's stigma. The Democrats seeking re-election this fall in states Republican Trump carried \u2014 the battlefront in the fight for Senate control \u2014 are portraying themselves as independent actors and known entities in hopes of inoculating themselves against Republican accusations that they are lockstep obstructionists to Trump's agenda. Among them: West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who wasted no time after Tuesday's GOP primary telling the many Republicans who have backed him over the decades he was no creature of Washington. \"If it makes sense for West Virginia, makes sense to me, I vote for it, doesn't matter whether it's Democrat or Republican,\" the former governor told supporters as he faces the most difficult re-election campaign of his 30-year career. Though an act of pure survival for senators in a pronounced anti-Washington environment, Manchin's tack, like that of North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp and others, shows the challenge Republicans face against incumbents with established brands. \"All of these Democrats have gotten elected in red states, which by definition means they have a brand at least somewhat independent of the national Democratic Party,\" said Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who is advising a group that supports Republican Senate candidates. \"We'll see whether those brands can withstand an even more partisan time than when they were first elected.\" In West Virginia and Indiana, Republican primary voters turned down U.S. House members' bids for the Senate, keeping the pressure on Manchin and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, who might have been able to attack an incumbent congressman's record during the campaign. Instead, they're facing outsiders with no federal record at a time when national polls show 80 percent of the public disapproves of the job Congress is doing. But Manchin, like others, has been preparing for such a scenario by portraying himself as loyal to his home state rather than party ideology. At his primary-night rally in Charleston, for instance, 94-year-old Medal of Honor recipient Woody Williams, a Trump supporter, introduced Manchin with a call-and-response: \"Repeat after me. I know Joe. You know Joe. We all know Joe.\" Manchin goes so far as to say \"Washington sucks\" in a recent ad. \"For me, it's always about West Virginia,\" Manchin says, wearing blue jeans and standing near the monument to a 1968 West Virginia coal mine disaster that killed 78 miners, including Manchin's uncle. Similarly, Donnelly has an ad with him driving a motorhome along a rural highway. \"You've got to be willing to drive down the Hoosier common-sense middle,\" he says. In North Dakota, Heitkamp is reprising a jocular spot of her six siblings teasing her about laundry duty, aimed at casting the former state attorney general and petroleum lawyer as the amiable woman next door. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill's first campaign ad for her 2018 re-election campaign features the Democrat's work on behalf of a local veteran who had been denied government benefits after exposure to poisonous gas seven decades ago. In Wisconsin, Sen. Tammy Baldwin has recently aired a lighthearted ad about her work to protect the state's prized cheese industry, complete with mooing cows. \"What we're seeing in these early ads is an effort to localize and personalize these candidates \u2014 to put distance between them and Washington,\" said Steven Law, who heads Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's super PAC Senate Leadership Fund. \"In effect, they're saying: 'I'm like you. I'm not part of the D.C. mess.'\" Mr. Trump took on Donnelly during a campaign-style rally Thursday night in Elkhart, Indiana, calling him \"Sleepin' Joe\" and a \"swamp person.\" He said Democrats like Donnelly will say one thing at home \"and then they go to Washington and vote for the radical, liberal agenda. It never, ever fails. You know there's about 12 of 'em. You think you have their vote. And they talk a good game. But they always raise their hand for the radical left of Nancy Pelosi. Always. \" Some of the incumbents find ways to align themselves with Mr. Trump or to cast themselves as being at odds with some of their Democratic colleagues. Manchin said Wednesday he would vote for Trump's nominee to lead the CIA, Gina Haspel, despite widespread opposition among Democrats. The day before, he said he backs Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement as long as the president pursues \"a better deal.\" McCaskill isn't so friendly with Trump. But she recently chided Hillary Clinton after the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said she topped Trump in \"the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward.\" Said McCaskill, \"For those of us that are in states that Trump won, we would really appreciate if she would be more careful and show respect to every American voter and not just the ones who voted for her.\" Whether Republicans can expand their 51-49 Senate edge or Democrats can regain the majority begins with the fate of the 10 Democrats seeking re-election in states Trump carried, including Florida, Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Each of the 10 Democratic senators, along with the entire party caucus, voted against the GOP tax cut measure Mr. Trump signed in December, a point Republican groups are using to overpower the Democrats' effort to appear above partisanship. That's exactly what powerful outside groups such as the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity have been doing for weeks already. Such groups have already spent nearly $10 million on ads attacking Baldwin in Wisconsin, though she won't have a general election opponent until after the August primary. They've spent $5 million doing the same against Donnelly and more than that combined against Heitkamp, McCaskill, Manchin and Montana Sen. Jon Tester. \"You just tie them to their votes,\" said Republican media consultant Will Ritter. Though the Democratic incumbents are trying to explain their votes as fiscally responsible and necessary to protect Social Security and Medicare, a steady stream of messages pounding at the tax cut opposition and other party-line votes can chip away at a personal brand over time, strategists and pollsters in both parties said.",

            "article_content": "A dragon winds around a cherry tree in the tattoo across MJ Hegar's arm and back, over the shrapnel wounds she had, at one point, not wanted to see with her young children around. But nine years after being shot down in Afghanistan, then winning a lawsuit against the federal government, writing a book and now running for a Texas congressional seat, Hegar isn't hiding much anymore. \"I carry my service with me wherever I go,\" Hegar said in a telephone interview near her home in Round Rock, outside Austin. \"We don't see my family and my childhood and my service as different chapters. It's all a package deal.\" Hegar is part of a crop of female veterans running for Congress in this year's midterm elections. Almost all Democrats and many of them mothers, they are shaped by the Sept. 11 attacks and overseas wars, including the longest war in American history. Many are retiring from the military and looking for another way to serve the country. They're part of a record number of women running for seats in Congress, but in certain ways, they are a class apart. The female veterans claim expertise in national security and veterans issues, with a track record of thriving in institutions dominated by men. Regardless of party, they cast themselves as the antidote to bitterly partisan politics \u2014 describing themselves as \"mission-driven\" and trained by the military to work toward a common goal. \"I flew 89 combat missions as a U.S. Marine. My 90th mission is running for Congress to take on politicians who put party over country,\" said Kentucky Democratic candidate Amy McGrath, the first female Marine to fly an F/A-18 in combat. The increase in candidates with military experience is no accident, and the hopefuls are expected to be propelled by Democratic luminaries. Former Vice President Joe Biden, for example, is expected to campaign for McGrath, among others, according to officials close to them who spoke on condition of anonymity because the schedule is not set. Two Democrats \u2014 Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, a retired Marine Corps captain and Bronze Star recipient, and Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who lost her legs and partial use of an arm when her helicopter was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade in Iraq \u2014 have been instrumental in recruiting veterans to run for office. Moulton said female veterans in his party carry a particular authority when talking to voters concerned about President Trump's leadership. \"It's the year of the woman, but it's also the year of yearning for bringing integrity and honor back to politics,\" Moulton said. \"We need Democrats with the credibility to tell people what's really going on.\" The women are hardly the first to use their military service to their political advantage \u2014 men have been doing it for decades. One of the traditional knocks against female candidates is \"they aren't tough enough, they aren't strong enough, and they might not have the leadership skills,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Not female candidates who are veterans, particularly of combat. \"They kind of automatically get that kind of respect as leaders; it's well-earned,\" Walsh said. \"It's such a logical next step for people who are committed to this country and are committed to service.\" But their campaigns highlight a set of political concerns specific to female veterans. The candidates acknowledge that their extraordinary stories of trailblazing military careers could make it difficult for some voters to relate to them. Will they come off as too tough or hawkish? Is it possible for any candidate, male or female, to overemphasize his or her military background in the post-9/11 era? McGrath, who retired as a lieutenant colonel, opened her campaign with an online video in which she wears a bomber jacket, a fighter jet in the background. McGrath sees herself as a bridge to male voters who \"sort of see women as being weaker,\" she said in a telephone interview. \"But yeah, I have to make an effort to reach out to women and make sure that they're not scared, or think that I'm too militant.\" Out came a 30-second spot that mentioned the 89 combat missions \u2014 but focused on McGrath taking her three children to the pediatrician. \"I'm Amy McGrath and I approved this ad,\" she says, as her young son takes off down a hallway with his pants down. \"Because I'd like to see the other guys running deal with this.\" She upset popular Lexington Mayor Jim Gray in the Democratic primary and will take on Republican Rep. Andy Barr in November, a closely watched race considered competitive in a district Barr won by 22 points in 2016. Poised for the different calculus of the general election, Barr last week released an ad quoting McGrath saying of herself, \"Hell yeah, I'm a feminist\" and calling herself \"a progressive.\" \"Seriously? Is that all you got?\" McGrath retorted in a video response, sharing the screen once again with a fighter jet. But this time, she traded her bomber jacket for a denim one. Much of Hegar's story was already public by the time she decided to challenge Republican Rep. John Carter in the Austin-area district, so she went for the full reveal \u2014 tattoos and all. Her video, \"Doors,\" features the door of the helicopter in which she was shot down on her third tour of Afghanistan as a combat search and rescue pilot. Her medals, including a Purple Heart, play a role, as does Hegar's 2012 lawsuit against the federal government that forced it to repeal the ban on women in combat. The spot also features an intimate detail: One of Hegar's first memories was of her father throwing her mother through a glass door. \"That's been one of the most difficult transitions for me, is talking about myself more,\" Hegar said. \"I hope that they take away that we have to start putting our faith in people who have a history of putting other people first, fighting against intimidation and bullying, and trying to do the right thing.\" Air Force veteran Gina Ortiz Jones, the Democratic nominee for a House seat in West Texas, hopes her active military duty and intelligence work will \"neutralize this perceived strength\" of Republicans as strong on security issues. That could be important in the race for the San Antonio-area seat, currently held by Republican Rep. Will Hurd, a former CIA operative. Ortiz Jones supports Medicare for all and single-payer health insurance, positions that could be considered too liberal for the district. \"'Liberal' isn't a word that is normally used to describe my work in national security,\" she said. If these women win, they will join an exclusive club in Congress. Just 19 percent of lawmakers are veterans \u2014 the same percentage that are women. Only four members are both: Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.; and Reps. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., and Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. \"It kind of reminds me of a fighter squadron, with so few women,\" said McSally, a retired Air Force veteran who was the first woman to fly in combat and is now running for U.S. Senate. All the candidates have stories about being among the only women working among men and have used their platform to speak out about abuses in the military. McSally told The Wall Street Journal in April that she was pressured into having sex in high school with a coach and that she became an Air Force pilot in part to regain a sense of power. But even there, she told the paper, she had \"similar, awful experiences in the military on the spectrum of abuse of power and sexual assault.\" She did not elaborate. Pennsylvania's Chrissy Houlahan, a retired Air Force officer and now a congressional candidate, said she cringed more than once when a male colonel \"used blonde jokes\" to introduce her for presentations to superior officers. \"I definitely felt some overt sexism,\" she said. New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill is a former helicopter pilot and prosecutor whose time at the Naval Academy dovetailed with the Tailhook sexual assault scandal in the Navy and Marine Corps. In the 1990s, she said, speaking out when she felt sexually harassed \"would really have impacted the way I was treated in the squadron.\" But these days, with a generation of women retiring from the military and a record number running for Congress, \"it's become a lot easier to talk about these things,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "Democrats didn't walk away with a clear win Tuesday night. But they didn't have to. They essentially battled Republicans to a draw in a central Ohio congressional district that should have been an easy win for the GOP. Even a too-close-to-call result was a sign of Democratic momentum and offered clues for how to run in November. Some takeaways from another round of voting ahead of the fall midterm elections: URBAN-RURAL-SUBURBAN SPLITS PREVIEW NOVEMBER BATTLES Democrat Danny O'Connor's strong showing in Ohio's 12th Congressional District offers his party a roadmap to the House majority: Galvanize suburbanites to join the party's urban base and offset the Republican advantage in rural areas. O'Connor came close to upsetting Republican Troy Balderson by running up his numbers closest to Columbus, performing better than Democrats recently have in the district's suburban core, and even managing to dent the GOP advantage in rural areas. O'Connor won 65 percent of the vote in precincts closest to heavily Democratic Columbus. He ran ahead of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential marks across the district: about 6 percentage points ahead of her mark in vote-rich Delaware, small-town Licking and rural Morrow counties. \"Tomorrow we rest and then we keep fighting through to November,\" O'Connor told supporters.\u00a0\u00a0 Far from the city, Balderson answered with his own wide margins, peaking at 69 percent in rural Morrow County. In suburban Delaware County, Balderson led by 8 percentage points. Many of the districts Democrats are hoping to flip in November are more favorable to them than the Ohio 12th. If they can compete there, they're well positioned in the key battlegrounds. The tight outcome also underscores lingering questions about President Donald Trump's value \u2014 or liability \u2014 to Republicans in the districts that will determine whether the party maintains its control of Congress. Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in 2016, and he rallied on Balderson's behalf ahead of Tuesday's vote. While Trump declared Balderson the winner, the close margin, several thousand provisional votes and absentee ballots, and Ohio law putting off a final count means it will be weeks before the outcome is known. THE YEAR OF WOMEN CONTINUES There will be at least eight Democratic women running for governor in November. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Laura Kelly of Kansas joined the list Tuesday. Both will face Republican men. Unlike some of their fellow Democratic nominees in other states, neither would become their state's first female governors. Whitmer and Kelly both have extensive records as legislative leaders and pitch themselves as get-it-done pragmatists. That's not in line with some of the headliners of the #MeToo era and the anti-Trump resistance movement, but it may be Democrats' best shot to flip two governor's mansions that Republicans have held since 2011. Two all-female races are set in Washington state. Democrat Lisa Brown, a university administrator and former state lawmaker, will take on Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the highest-ranking female House Republican, in an eastern Washington seat. Former state Republican chairwoman Susan Hutchison will try to unseat Sen. Maria Cantwell. DEMS HAVE THEIR ANTI-TAX LAW PLAYBOOK The narrow results in Ohio leave Democrats confident that they can win voters by running full-force against the GOP tax plan. O'Connor watched Republican outside groups outspend him as they poured millions into the race. But the GOP barrage mostly steered clear of touting the tax cuts that Republicans once said would be the key to maintaining control of Congress. Instead, they dusted off their well-worn approach of tying Democratic nominees to unpopular national party leaders like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. O'Connor, meanwhile, hammered the tax law as a threat to Social Security and Medicare. It's a similar argument to what Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania used earlier this year to win a special election in heavy GOP territory. Republican incumbents still insist that they'll champion tax cuts as the reason for strong economic numbers so far this year. But two high-profile special elections leave Democrats confident in their attacks on the signature legislation of Trump's first two years, and that ensures voters in battleground House districts will see and hear plenty of advertisements warning them about potential consequences of the Republican law.",

            "article_content": "It's possible, but O'Rourke will certainly have his work cut out for him.  It is, although a fair number of political observers assume it will probably lean more Democratic in the future due to demographic changes. But it's hard to know when that will happen. And in the meantime, the GOP has a firm grip on the older white voters that make up a large share of the Texas electorate.  Maybe. On the one hand, he's running in a state that's still dominated by the GOP. On the other, Cruz isn't the most popular guy, with a February University of Texas poll showing that only 40 percent of voters approve of his performance, while 41 percent disapprove.  And despite winning the state by nine points in 2016, President Trump may not be so popular either; according to a January poll from Gallup, only 39 percent of Texans approved of the president, while 54 percent disapproved.  This would seem to indicate that O'Rourke, an El Paso-area congressman, has a shot at knocking off Cruz. And sure enough, a Quinnipiac poll from last week found their race was very close, with Cruz winning 47 percent to O'Rourke's 44 percent, which is within the margin of error.  Yes, there is a chance that Beto O'Rourke becomes the first Democrat to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate since 1993. But again, he'll have his work cut out for him.  One way is to bet big on Democratic turnout while hoping that Republican turnout drops considerably. It's safe to assume that fewer people will vote in the midterms than in the 2016 general election, but if O'Rourke can get the vast majority of people who voted for Hillary Clinton last time, while Cruz gets a significantly smaller percentage of Mr. Trump's voters, then could be O'Rourke's path to victory. For example, if O'Rourke wins 80 percent of Clinton's votes, while Cruz only gets 60 percent of Mr. Trump's, then O'Rourke would win handily.\u00a0 It's reminiscent of how Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst won her seat in 2014 against Democrat Bruce Braley. President Obama had won Iowa in 2012, but his voters didn't turn out for Braley like Mitt Romney's did for Ernst. As a result, Ernst won in a landslide.  It's impossible to predict what will happen in the Texas race, especially this far out from November. But there are reasons to be skeptical that O'Rourke can pull of the upset.  Mark Jones, a political scientist at Rice University, told CBS News that despite all the hoopla and attention being paid to O'Rourke, he still has five major hurdles to clear. First, given the Republican tilt of the state's electorate, Cruz probably has a natural 12- to 15-point \"cushion\" going into the race.  The second is that, while Cruz may not be the most beloved guy in Texas, he's still a Republican, and he can probably expect GOP voters to go for him even if they dislike him personally.  The third is that O'Rourke is still something of an unknown quantity outside of his home district, with some 50 percent of voters saying they don't really know who he is, according to Jones.  The fourth is that Texas is massive, complex, and expensive, meaning Democrats will likely get more bang for their buck elsewhere. The most vulnerable Republican seats this November are in Arizona and Nevada, with Tennessee being another pickup opportunity for Democrats. The most vulnerable Democratic seats are in North Dakota, West Virginia, Indiana, and Missouri. So if you're a Democrat looking to donate in the hopes of your party winning back the Senate, you're probably better off spending there, and not in a long-shot Texas race.  \"It costs about as much to run a statewide campaign in those seven states [combined] as it does in the Lone Star state,\" Jones says. O'Rourke's fundraising so far has no doubt been impressive \u2013 he raked in close to $7 million in the first few months of 2018 \u2013 but he'd probably need to bring in somewhere between $20 and $30 million to compete with Cruz.  And the fifth is Texas' straight-ticket voting system, which allows voters to cast a ballot for a particular party's entire slate. A significant percentage of Texas voters tend to vote for a straight ticket, which is good news for Cruz, because Gov. Greg Abbott, the most popular politician in the state, will be at the top of his.  Abbott, who's very likely to win reelection in November, also has a well-funded statewide organization that will concentrate on turning out the Republican voters both he and Cruz depend on. O'Rourke, who's doing most of the heavy lifting for Texas Democrats this year, has no comparable ally on his ticket.  While it would still be a mistake to count O'Rourke out, particularly with so many months left to go before the election, Cruz still has a significant edge. Texas is still Republican territory, at least when it comes to statewide races. Cruz also probably benefits from being a well-known quantity, while O'Rourke will have to fight an uphill battle to define himself in a state with laden with expensive media markets.  But the young, attractive O'Rourke has been exciting his party's base and outraising his opponent. Although still relatively unknown, he's begun building a national profile. His roadtrip from Texas to Washington alongside GOP Rep. Will Hurd, another rising star up for reelection this year, attracted plenty of attention from the press and seemed to speak to O'Rourke's bipartisan bona fides.  Needless to say, and regardless of who wins, the Texas senate race will be one to keep an eye on. Cruz's campaign is betting in part that O'Rourke, who has called for making Medicare available to everyone and flaunts his \"F\" rating from the NRA, is simply too left for Texas. However, if O'Rourke wins the race, or even if it just keeps in close, it will indicate that progressive candidates can win in the Lone Star state.  At this point, the race is probably Cruz's to lose. But a lot can happen between now and November, meaning that Democrats may get a real shot at knocking off one of the country's most famously conservative politicians.\u00a0",

Great to have you on the show and to talk about the just released, just today report of the National Defense Strategy Commission. ERIC EDELMAN: Great to be here with you. MICHAEL MORELL: I need to start by telling our listeners that I am not an unbiased interviewer here. I myself was a member of the commission-- and a member who believes deeply in the conclusions that we reached. And I want the listeners to know that, and I want there to be full transparency here as to-- as to my bias. And to try to compensate a little bit for that, Eric, I'm gonna try to ask some questions that a critic of the report might ask, okay? ERIC EDELMAN: Fair enough. MICHAEL MORELL: I also want to note that you are one of two co-chairs of the commission. We tried to work out schedules so that your counterpart, the other co-chair, Admiral Gary Roughhead, former chief of Naval Operations, could join us today, but that didn't work out. But I wanted to note Gary's important role in the commission, and I know you want to do that as well. ERIC EDELMAN: Absolutely. He's been fabulous co-chair, and the-- good thing about it is, I think he and I have all through this process been very much, you know, on the same wavelength and have seen things the same way, as did you and all the other commissioners. I mean, one of the things that was really great about this experience was how not only bipartisan it was, but how nonpartisan it was. And I think if your listeners had been able to, you know, be a fly on the wall for our deliberations over the last year-plus-- they would have had a hard time figuring out who had been nominated to this commission by Republican members of the House and Senate and who by the Democrats. Because it was a truly serious group of professionals wrestling with very difficult issues. MICHAEL MORELL: It's the way Washington should work. ERIC EDELMAN: One would hope. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay, Eric. The, perhaps the place to start is to ask, what is the National Defense Strategy Commission? And what was its charter? ERIC EDELMAN: So the congress going back almost 20 years has periodically appointed independent commissions to give it a second opinion on the strategies and particularly the strategy documents that the Department of Defense has produced pursuant to legislation. So it was the case that after the end of the Cold War the Department of Defense stated producing quadrennial defense reviews. In 2010 and 2014, congress appointed a commission to review those Q.D.R. documents. And in accord with some of the recommendations that came out of the 2014 commission, the congress actually changed the legislative requirement on the Department of Defense and said, \"We want you to produce not a Q.D.R. but a National Defense Strategy.\" But they also appointed a commission to provide some input into that strategy from a group of national security professionals appointed by members of congress, but also then to, as with the other commissions provide them with an expert second opinion on the strategy produced by the DOD MICHAEL MORELL: And that was us. ERIC EDELMAN: And that was us. MICHAEL MORELL: And the report is to the congress? ERIC EDELMAN: It is to the congress. I mean, it is-- in the legislation, it originally was to the president and to the Secretary of Defense as well. And of course both the White House and the Department of Defense have received advanced copies of the report. MICHAEL MORELL: And congress has it as well? ERIC EDELMAN: The congress has advanced copies as well, and they have had it for several days. MICHAEL MORELL: And I know that you and Gary are scheduled to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee in a few weeks. ERIC EDELMAN: On November 27th, we'll be testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee yet to be scheduled, but we're working on scheduling a hearing date there as well. MICHAEL MORELL: And the last question before we jump into the report. Where can the public find a copy of this? ERIC EDELMAN: The, it will be posted on the web. And-because U.S.I.P., the U.S. Institute of Peace has hosted us, I think you can look there, and you will be able to find a copy, a downloadable copy of the report. MICHAEL MORELL: Great. So Eric, what I'd like to do with the rest of the interview is walk through the commission's view of the state of our military. Talk about why the commission believes the situation has evolved in the way it has. And then discuss what the commission recommends we do about all of that. Does that make sense? ERIC EDELMAN: Absolutely. MICHAEL MORELL: And with that outline in mind let's dig in on where we find ourselves today. And let me start by reading four quotes from the executive summary. \"First, the security and wellbeing of the United States than at any time in decades. America's military superiority has eroded to a dangerous degree. Second, many of the skills necessary to plan for and conduct military operations against capable adversaries have atrophied.\" \"Third, America's edge is diminishing or has disappeared in many key technologies that underpin U.S. military superiority. And fourth,\" and kinda the punchline, \"these trends are undermining deterrents of U.S. adversaries and the confidence of American allies, thus increasing the likelihood of military conflict. The U.S. military could suffer unacceptably high casualties and the loss of major capital assets in its next conflict. It might struggle to win or perhaps lose the war against China or Russia.\" So those are stark, even grim words. Couple of questions about all of that. First is, can you give us a concrete example of the situation that we find ourselves in? Either talking about the Baltics or Taiwan or something else to put this in context for folks? ERIC EDELMAN: So, if I could, let me kind of pull the camera back a little bit, and because I suffer from the deficiency that I'm a recidivist on this panel. I was also on the 2010 and 2014 panel, so I watched three panels, and this one I got to be a co-chair on. But I've watched three panels wrestle with these issues over the better part of the decade. And in the 2010 report the commission, the then independent commissioner reviewed the Q.D.R., concluded that budget cuts and an increasingly complex international environment were leading to a potential train wreck. And then in 2014 and that was, first report was before the Budget Control Act of 2011. In 2014, in the aftermath of the Budget Control Act, we said that the B.C.A. was a strategic misstep that was disabling the U.S. because it was facing greater challenges around the world. And we quoted then Secretary of Defense Hagel saying that, \"Our margin of superiority vis-\u00e0-vis our potential great power competitors, Russia and China was declining.\" And in this report, I think what we had to wrestle with was the consequences of all those warnings having been ignored. And so we have over a very long period of time been engaged since 9/11 and you and I were both part of this, in a very long conflict with irregular forces, with terrorist forces around the world. We've gotten extremely good at combating those kinds of terrorist forces, and I would say the proof is in the pudding, which is since 9/11, the United States has not suffered a similar mass casualty attack of that kind. And it's not for lack of trying by our adversaries, as you yourself have written about. In that time, however Russia and China in particular, but other actors in the international arena, particularly would be nuclear powers, a new nuclear power in North Korea and a would-be nuclear power in Iran, have studied the way that we fight and that we're prepared to fight, and have developed a suite of capabilities that are meant to in an asymmetric way be able to counter the kinds of things we can do. So, for instance, you have seen, in the case of China, the development of very robust set of capabilities. Anti-ship cruise missiles, anti-ship ballistic missiles that create what strategists call-- anti-access area denial problem. What that means is that we can't fight traditionally the way we have fought which is to-- MICHAEL MORELL: Meant to keep us away. ERIC EDELMAN: It's meant to keep us further away, push us further out into the Pacific, away from the Asian literal. And the way we have traditionally dealt with great power aggressors, the way we did, for instance, in the Gulf War was, the aggression occurs, and then we come in with unimpeded access, both by air and sea. We build up a so-called iron mountain. We, you know, load up our troops, we load up our equipment, and then we go and reverse the aggression. And with Russia and China we find that they are developing capabilities precisely meant to preclude our ability to do that. MICHAEL MORELL: They've learned from it-- ERIC EDELMAN: They've learned from what we've done. They've learned from our success. And while we've been off doing a different kind of warfare, they've been prepared for a kind of warfare at the high end that we really haven't engaged in for a very long time. And which we have not been training for. And therefore our forces have not maintained the kind of proficiency that you would like to see in in that kind of warfare were it to become necessary. And where those shrinking margins might entice-- a future Russian leader or future Chinese leader to think, \"I can take these actions because the Americans are unlikely to respond, because they are not as capable of responding as they once were.\" MICHAEL MORELL: You mentioned the 2010, 2014 reports-- both review panels on which you served. And I had my assistant go through both of them. And she cited exactly what you cited. A 2010 report provided quote, \"an explicit warning that things were heading in the wrong direction.\" 2014, the warning got stronger. What really strikes me about our report is the extraordinary strong sense of urgency about where we now are. ERIC EDELMAN: You know, I think for a lot of reasons both the American public and members of congress have not been as attentive to this set of issues as they ought to be. One reason is, Americans in general have paid less attention to the world than other countries have historically. And I think there's been a disposition to believe that we spend so much money on defense that, you know, obviously we should be able to deal with all comers. But what I think people have lost sight of is that the international environment has just become so much more complicated. During the Cold War, we had one major superpower adversary. And everything else we dealt with was in some sense a lesser included case of the overall U.S.-Soviet confrontation. And that provided a kind of ordering mechanism for thinking your way through problems. Sometimes our leaders thought through them better and sometimes worse. And we weren't always successful, but at least we had a framework that made it possible to kinda go through a decision tree and make reasonable decisions about national security issues. Today, we face both two great power challengers, one in Asia, one in Europe. We have a new nuclear power in North Korea that is developing a larger, more capable arsenal I think than almost anybody anticipated. I think most people anticipated that North Korea would develop a handful of weapons in order to hold off America's overwhelming conventional power and prevent a forcible regime change of the Kim family dynasty. MICHAEL MORELL: Simple deterrent on their part. ERIC EDELMAN: Simple deterrent. But now it looks like they're developing all the appurtenances of a nuclear triad with mobile I.C.B.M. and a submarine launched I.C.B.M. And numerical arsenal that could run as high, if you look at the higher-end calculations of where they might go in unclassified sources, could be, you know, as close to the size of the U.K.'s arsenal. That's a different-order problem I think than most people had anticipated, which is why I hope President Trump and Secretary Pompeo and Steve Biegun, my former colleague are successful in their endeavor. I have some doubts about it, but I hope they're successful in defanging that particular threat. And then we have the threat from Iran which is destabilizing an entire region, and that's had plenty of news focused on it in the last few weeks of course. MICHAEL MORELL: And developing their own significant military capabilities. ERIC EDELMAN: Developing their own capabilities, in many ways aping a lot of these capabilities at a different context-- a Gulf context, but similar anti-access, area denial-- capabilities to try and push U.S. forces further and further away from the Gulf. And then we have all the steady state activity that we continue to have to engage in to deal with the jihadist threat, which remains. A threat from, you know-- radical Islamist, violent extremists-- is going to be a persistent one that we're going to have to maintain an eye on as well-- MICHAEL MORELL: So you've looked at the U.S. defense needs for a long time. Is this the worst you've seen it? Is there a comparable time in the post-war-- post-World War II period that you can think of? How does this compare? ERIC EDELMAN: I can't think of a time where the international security environment was as complicated as it was, and places as many potential conflicting demands on U.S. forces as this situation could, you know, in extremis inflict on us. And I think that's one of the challenges that our colleagues in the Pentagon have had. You, they have to be prepared potentially for a fight tonight on the North-- in the Korean Peninsula with North Korea. That-- that's something they've had to be prepared for for a long time. But they now also have to be prepared for potential activities by China, whether in the East China Sea or the South China Sea, Taiwan. They've gotta worry about Iran because of the Russian activities beginning in 2008 really, the invasion of Georgia and the annexation of Abkhazia and Ossetia. There has been a reawakening of awareness that Russia poses a threat to its neighbors. MICHAEL MORELL: And now Ukraine. ERIC EDELMAN: And now Ukraine. The seizure of Crimea and its incorporation into Russia and violation of Russia's international undertakings. And the potential threat to the Baltics, which are NATO allies and have an Article V guarantee. All of those things are things that the Department of Defense has to be prepared for while they're also out hunting and killing terrorists. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, so here's I think-- a really important question, and I know we talked about this in the commission, which is the ability to articulate why the average American should care about all this, right? You know, for many Americans, and I certainly see this traveling around the country, there's a view that the U.S. has its own problems here at home. We should focus on those. Those should be the priority. We shouldn't pay the high price necessary to lead in the world and therefore we don't need the kind of military power we're talking about in this report. How do you respond to that? ERIC EDELMAN: Well, it's a fair question. And it's one that I think the national security elite, and very much this is, you know, as much self-criticism as it is criticism of anybody else, has not done a very good job of making this case to this broader public since the Cold War ended. And we tend to talk about it in terms of sort of bloodless abstractions. Like, the liberal, normative rules-based order, which doesn't mean very much to most people. MICHAEL MORELL: Or global stability. ERIC EDELMAN: Or global stability. I mean, what we're really talking about is a system of trading relationships and a system of political military alliances that, at the end of World War II, the U.S. created. And they created them to manage the world really in a way that would hopefully first-- prevent Communist power from expanding and becoming dominant, which at the end of World War II it looked like it might well do. Both in Europe and in Asia, particularly after the revolution in China in 1949. And also to allow the international economy that had been devastated by the most costly war in history, both in lives and in treasure had laid waste the economy, both in Asia and in Europe. And the United States was largely responsible for creating a set of institutions that made it possible for trade to resume and for economic growth to occur. And it led to the so-called \"European miracle,\" the rebirth of Europe. A prosperous, peaceful Europe instead of one that was challenging the peace of the world twice in the 20th century. It led to the development of industrial powerhouse in Japan and then the rise of the so-called \"Asian Tiger\" economies. It led to the longest period of great power peace and prosperity in the history of the world. So this is really about maintaining peace and maintaining prosperity of Americans-- MICHAEL MORELL: And U.S. military power underpins all of that. ERIC EDELMAN: All of that depended on the fact that the United States was the preeminent military power in the world. MICHAEL MORELL: And it's your view, I don't want to put words in your mouth. But it's your view that if we don't have that, and we don't lead in the world, then our prosperity will suffer. There will be conflict in the world in which we will inevitably get drawn into. And that's going to cost lives. Is that fair-- ERIC EDELMAN: I'm glad you put the words in my mouth, because I put, couldn't have put them better. (LAUGH) MICHAEL MORELL: So the second issue is why we're here. You've talked a little bit about that already in terms of how our adversaries have changed and advanced and grown. But the report also talks about developments here at home. In particular what's going on in terms of the budget. Can you talk about that a little bit? ERIC EDELMAN: Well. Again, I think one has to-- you know, pull back the lens a little bit, because otherwise we, you know, get into the dangerous territory which we frequently do here in Washington of, you know, being like an amnesiac trying to understand, you know, how they got to where they are. At the end of the Cold War, the United States essentially took a peace dividend. We began to cut the defense budget from the kind of high levels that we had had during the Cold War, and in one sense that was completely understandable. But it also coincided with a period in which the U.S. operational tempo for the military got a lot higher. I mean, we were intervening in Somalia. We were intervening in Bosnia. We were intervening in Kosovo. We were-dealing with lots of-- Haiti. We were dealing with lots of different challenges to order. We were the sole superpower. It was the so-called \"unipolar moment,\" and really nobody else could take on these challenges or organize the response, and we ended up doing it. So at the same time that we were cutting defense, the operational tempo was increasing, which meant that we were not investing in future capability. After 9/11, when we began to deal with the war on terror we ended up chewing through even more of the capital stock, the equipment-- the force structure as the Pentagon calls it-- that we had inherited, essentially from the Reagan defense buildup. And then while we did have-- you know, some increases in defense during the years, early years of the war on terror, when the change of administrations came, there was a downturn in defense spending, which was then compounded by the Budget Control Act, which ended up cutting even more out of prospective defense budgets. And that means that we have basically been underfunding the Defense Department for quite a period of time-- MICHAEL MORELL: This was a deal between the Obama White House and the Republicans in congress. ERIC EDELMAN: Right. This is, I mean there's plenty of blame to go around about this. I mean, both sides agreed to it. As my former colleague at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments now at C.S.I.S., Todd Harrison, used to like to say, \"The problem with the Budget Control Act was it took the defense budget hostage,\" in part because President Obama thought that if he took the defense budget hostage, the Republicans in congress would agree to increase taxes. And the Republicans in congress thought that if they held the defense budget, they could get Obama to agree to different things that they wanted in the in the budget. And as Todd used to say, \"Problem is, you know, if two people take someone hostage, it usually doesn't work out well for the hostage.\" MICHAEL MORELL: Right, and certainly that's the case here. So I want to move on to what do we do about all this? But before we get to that, part of our charter as a commission was to assess how the Pentagon is thinking about this, right? To actually look at their national defense strategy and assess it. And can you talk about where we came out on that? That's kind of important. ERIC EDELMAN: So the Pentagon's strategy, which Secretary Mattis rolled out, first of all-- was nested beneath a national security strategy, overarching strategy that President Trump announced in December of 2017 that was prepared under General McMaster, when he was the national security advisor. And what both those documents did and both those strategies did was raise in priority, although it had been recognized certainly by members of the previous administration, particularly Secretary Ash Carter, Secretary of Defense Carter in the Obama administration-- he recognized that we were increasingly in competition with great powers. And we were back in that kind of great power competition business with China and Russia. The national security strategy and the national defense strategy took that insight and took it a little further and said, these are actually long-term security competitions that we're in. And they're going to really be the defining competitions of potential military conflict in the 21st century. And so we have to reprioritize, shift our priorities around a bit in the Department of Defense to focus more on those long-term challenges. And I think that's a reorientation that we on the commission I think unanimously agreed with. That is the correct focus for the, both the national security strategy and also the national defense strategy of the United States. So I think we are largely in agreement with the objectives of the strategy. And we can talk more about the other findings we have. But the general vector that we have to be-- first of all prioritizing long-term competition with Russia and China while being mindful of these other threats that we have been discussing this morning, and which include North Korea, Iran, jihadism-- that has to be the way that the United States-- conducts itself in the world. And in particular, that we need to maintain a balance of power in Europe, in Asia, and in the Middle East that is conducive to American interests. And that is-- I think-- a formal recognition of something that essentially has been an informal part of American grand strategy since the end of the Second World War. MICHAEL MORELL: The critique though, right, was while the vector is right, there's not a strong sense in the national defense strategy about how to get there. ERIC EDELMAN: Yes. So I think the concerns we had about the strategy-- there were several, and we could spend time on any one of them. We could probably spend a podcast on each one, but first the strategy needs to be adequately resourced. And I would, that's my personal view, I would place that first. And in that context Secretary Mattis and Chairman Dunford, before they produced the national defense strategy testified before congress that in order to execute the strategy they had-- inherited, Secretary Mattis inherited under President Obama that was the so-called Defense Strategic Guidance of 2012, that strategy they believed was going to require additional resources for the Department of Defense beyond what the Budget Control Act caps allow. They were talking about 3% to 5% annual real growth. I think it was our judgment that this new strategy is clearly more ambitious than the earlier strategy, which was largely just a kind of refocus towards Asia from Europe and was-actually written before Russia invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine and before it became completely clear where North Korea was going with its nuclear program. So the resource level has to be commensurate with the objectives of the strategy. And we were unable I think to put an exact number. I'm not sure we would have agreed as a commission as the exact number, but we certainly could say that you need to have greater resources devoted, if you're going to execute this strategy. And we also I think faulted, and this is not the Department of Defense's fault, but the congress and the executive branch for not taking action to get out of this Budget Control Act trap of arbitrary caps on defense and a series of continuing resolutions, rather than regular order in budgeting, so that the Department of Defense can have predictable, appropriate funding to execute the strategy. That was the first gap we saw. The second gap I think we identified is that, there was-- it wasn't clear from the strategy itself what kinds of operational concepts we would use in the future to fight these more able competitors. And therefore, we were directing in essence the congress to say, \"This is one area where your oversight responsibilities are important.\" You need to be. MICHAEL MORELL: This is the how to fight. ERIC EDELMAN: This is the how to fight piece, and you need to be pressing the Department of Defense to tell you what kind of novel, creative ways, because even if you get all the funding that we would want, even-- I probably, maybe I and one or two other commissioners would probably be at the high end of what we would be willing to spend on defense among the commissioners. That even if I got everything I would want-- that's not gonna be enough. We are also gonna have to fight differently, fight smarter, and we are base-- MICHAEL MORELL: Exactly what the Chinese and Russians are doing, right? ERIC EDELMAN: Exactly, we gotta-- we've gotta match the kind of intellectual fire power they're bringing to the problem with that kind of fire power of our own, and we were directing the congress to say, \"This is where you ought to be holding the Department of Defense's feet to the fire to make sure that that the strategy is executable.\" MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So on the resource piece-- 3% to 5% real growth is a huge dollar figure over a period of years. And we did not take a position on where that money should come from. But stepping out of your role as the co-chair of this thing, where is that money gonna come from? ERIC EDELMAN: Well, we do address some of the issues that-- that are raised by the resource question. First, if you look at the long-term budget projections of the Congressional Budget Office, the C.B.O., it's very clear what's driving the long-term deficits. And that is, the entitlement programs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. That makes up the bulk of it. Defense is, you know, part of the so-called discretionary budget that congress gets to play with. And it's only about 25% of that budget. Yet it's been varying under the B.C.A. 50%, you know, of the cuts. Clearly, I think where this money has to come from is some combination of reform of entitlements and revenue. And speaking personally I'm willing to bear a higher tax burden in order to make sure that the, we can defend the United States. I think it's the first obligation that the constitution imposes on the congress, which is to provide for the common defense, which is part of our title. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, and at the end of the day, it's part of the responsibility of the leaders of the country, both the president and the congress to make the case to the American people why that's important. ERIC EDELMAN: Why that's important, exactly. And we talked about that. MICHAEL MORELL: You know, we spend some time talking about technology and the fact that the rest of the world has caught up. Critically with regard to technologies that are important to the military. And there's a very interesting line in our report that recommends, and I'll quote here, \"pursuing selective economic disintegration with rivals to avoid dangerous dependencies.\" What does that mean? What does that look like? ERIC EDELMAN: So one of the things that-- you know, has become clear and which we delved into as part of our deliberations was the degree to which the supply chain for the major defense contractors who provide the weaponry and the equipment for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, the men and women of all of our military services have dependency on-- in particular on things made in China. MICHAEL MORELL: This is a consequence of globalization and? ERIC EDELMAN: Yeah, this is not anybody's fault. This is just-- you know, a consequence of. MICHAEL MORELL: How the world economy works. ERIC EDELMAN: The world economy works, the law of comparative advantage and labor rates and the comparative labor rates, what have you. But we want to make, we need to make sure we have to as a country make sure we don't find ourselves in a position where one of our adversaries could throw a monkey wrench into our ability to defend ourselves. And so we may have to do some things that would, you know, require us maybe to not buy the cheapest product but the one that we have the most control over, in order to prevent that you know, from happening. And I think that's-- I'm glad you highlighted that, because I think that's something that hasn't gotten as much attention as it should. But there's a whole-- MICHAEL MORELL: And something that's going to require private sector understanding at the end of the day. ERIC EDELMAN: That's a very important point. You know, we, in-- in the Cold War era-- a lot of commercial development came on the back of, you know, military technical development. So I mean when you and I were growing up, you know -- Tang was a product that came out of the space program. You know, sort of a freeze-dried orange juice that you could stir into a glass of water, which had been originally produced for astronauts. I mean, so a lot of commercial aviation grew on the back of the military. And that's now reversed-- particularly because of the importance of information technology. And so the Department of Defense and the military are going to be much more dependent on the commercial world. And we've already seen instances where there has been some resistance on parts of the tech community to working with the U.S. government and particularly the Department of Defense, of people objecting to companies bidding on the DoD Cloud for instance, or opposing participation in the DoD so-called Maven program. Those are issues that we're going to have to wrestle with as a society. MICHAEL MORELL: And-- maybe this is a good place to-- I just want to ask two more questions about the report, and maybe this is a great place to ask the first one. This is not just DoD's issue. Right? This is, and-- in some cases it's not even just the federal government's issue. This is a whole of government, a whole of society issue when you think about education, when you think about this private sector-government relationship that has to happen here. So this is not just the Defense Department at the end of the day. ERIC EDELMAN: Well, I couldn't agree more. So first, the strategy, the national defense strategy, national security strategy argued that we have these long-term competitions with Russia and China that the United States has to position itself to be able to prevail in. But I think we as a commission were impressed by the fact that we're actually not just in competition with these countries. In some areas like cyber, we're actually in conflict with them every day. And that's ongoing, and it's happening now. And a lot of those competitions, this goes on in the so-called \"gray zone--\" whether it's a functional or geographic gray zone. A lot of that competition is not particularly the province of the Department of Defense. I mean, in some cases, it's because China relies on so-called private fishing fleet or maritime militias that are not military. They're more sort of police forces that are not strictly speaking, you know, a counterpart to our military forces. And so a lot of these activities are not things that are necessarily in the Department of Defense's gambit. They're either part of the intelligence community, the State Department, other departments of the government treasury, et cetera. So you're right, and this is going to take a whole of government effort. And I'm glad you said whole of society, because some of the challenges we face, particularly as new technologies come online, and I have in mind things like hypersonics and artificial intelligence-- quantum computing, areas where Russia and China, particularly China are putting enormous amount of effort into. And that's going to require commensurate effort from the United States. And a lot of that's going to rest on our educational system, not just the Department of Defense. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. So just one more question Eric, aand maybe it's a little unfair. ERIC EDELMAN: Those are the best kind. MICHAEL MORELL: But given everything you just talked about, are you optimistic or pessimistic that the United States as a nation, that incoming congress, future congresses, current administration, future administrations are going to get this right? ERIC EDELMAN: It's-- I am by nature and have always been a very optimistic person. And certainly when you look at the history of the United States, we have been an incredibly resilient nation. Overcoming a devastating Civil War that, you know, cost 600,000 lives. Overcoming the history of slavery and racial bigotry that marked our country. We've made enormous strides as a nation. And coming back from the Great Depression, winning the Second World War with the greatest generation. So we've historically been very resilient and able to come back from either setbacks or defeats of one sort or another. So I hope that we will be able to rise to this challenge, which is as we've been discussing a serious challenge and a complicated challenge. You know, one thing that gives me a little bit of hope is the way our own commission operated. As you said at the outset, you know, this is the way you would want, you know, Washington to work, which is for the good of the country with party not really being a factor. And it's there that I have my greatest worries about whether we will again rise to this challenge and continue our history of national resilience. And that is, that our political institutions have become more brittle-- and more tribal. And I hope that we can move beyond that so that the country can come together. I noted with some interest that a number of the new members of the House who were elected in the election on Tuesday have military service in their backgrounds. MICHAEL MORELL: And intelligence. ERIC EDELMAN: And intelligence. And-- exactly, and so I'm hoping that that new cohort will bring to it a country before party approach that will help us get through this very difficult period that we're going to be heading into. MICHAEL MORELL: That's going to be necessary to get done. ERIC EDELMAN: All the things we've talked about-- MICHAEL MORELL: All the things we've talked about. Eric, thank you so much for joining us. It's going to be fascinating to see what kind of attention the report gets. ERIC EDELMAN: Thank you so much for having me in today. And I look forward to working with you and other commissioners to try and make people understand what we, what kind of challenge we have ahead of us. It's a big one. MICHAEL MORELL: Thank you.",

            "article_content": "President Trump announced on Thursday that he's introducing an effort to make some prescription drug prices fairer and more comparable to what they are in other countries.\u00a0 Foreign countries and drug companies, the president declared in a speech at the Department of Health and Human Services Thursday, have been taking advantage of Americans consumers for too long. The regulation the administration is proposing would set up what's called an \"international pricing index\" that would be used as a reference point for helping set up prices for drugs paid for through Medicare Part B.\u00a0 \"Today, we are here to announce another bold and historic action to bring down the price of prescription drugs,\" the president said. \"With the action I am unveiling today, the United States will finally begin to confront one of the most unfair practices \u2014 almost unimaginable that it hasn't been taken care of long before this \u2014 that drives up the cost of medicine in the United States.\" The president, as he often does in other policy areas, focused on how \"unfair\" the current system is to patients.\u00a0 \"At long last the drug companies and foreign countries will be held accountable for how they rigged the system against American consumers,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This is a revolutionary change. Nobody's had the courage to do it or they just didn't want to do it. And this is a change for the people. This is not a change for industry or for companies or for pharma. This is a change for the people. It will be substantially a reduction in drug prices for our people and our senior citizens. Tremendous, tremendous difference.\" The commander-in-chief also said his administration will soon be announcing some things that he claimed will have a tremendous impact on health care costs, although he didn't specify what he meant by that. Health care is high among voters' election-year concerns \u2014 particularly for Democrats. Mr. Trump has promised sweeping action to attack drug prices, both as president and when he campaigned for the White House. In advance of the speech, HHS released a report that found U.S. prices for the top drugs administered in doctor's offices are nearly twice as high as in foreign countries. The list includes many cancer drugs. Medicare pays directly for them under its \"Part B\" coverage for outpatient care. HHS Secretary Alex Azar on Twitter said \"the current international pricing system has put America in last place.\" In most other economically advanced countries, governments take a direct role in setting drug prices. That's something the United States traditionally has avoided, and Republicans in particular are loath to do. Azar said Medicare spent about $8 billion more for drugs in the study than if the prices paid by the program were scaled to international prices. Any push to dramatically lower prices here would meet resistance not only from drugmakers but from doctors, two of the most powerful lobbies. Mr. Trump has harshly criticized the pharmaceutical industry, once asserting that the companies were \"getting away with murder,\" a comment that sent pharmaceutical stocks tumbling. But it's largely been business as usual for drugmakers even as the president has predicted \"massive\" voluntary price cuts. A recent Associated Press analysis of prices for brand-name drugs found far more increases than cuts in the first seven months of this year. The analysis found 96 price hikes for every price cut. The number of increases slowed somewhat and they were not quite as steep as in past years, the AP found. As a candidate, Mr. Trump called for using Medicare's clout to negotiate prices. As president, he's had to shelve that idea since it's a nonstarter for congressional Republicans and even Azar. Instead the White House has opted for a complex strategy that incorporates some 50 proposals to try to change the workings of a market that is legendary for being opaque. Some of those ideas have advanced. Over industry objections, the administration is moving to require drugmakers to disclose prices in their consumer advertising. And Mr. Trump signed into law a bill that outlaws so-called \"gag clauses\" preventing pharmacists from telling customers when they could save money by paying cash instead of using their insurance. The Food and Drug Administration is approving generics at a record pace. In another warning shot at the industry, the FDA is studying ways to allow lower-cost drug imports from abroad in the event of U.S. price spikes. But Medicare and Medicaid changes are more difficult to carry out, since congressional approval would be needed for any major policy shifts. The White House also seems committed to squeezing middlemen called \"pharmacy benefit managers,\" companies that run prescription coverage for insurers and employers. The benefit managers say the rebates they win from drugmakers get returned to consumers in the form of lower insurance premiums. But administration officials say rebates add hidden costs to the system and in effect encourage drug companies to price higher to begin with.",

            "article_content": "Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum has been a vocal advocate of a Bernie Sanders \"Medicare for All\" approach to health care coverage, but he acknowledges that there are some hurdles that would be difficult to surmount, should he be elected. If Floridians vote him into the governor's mansion, he says he'll expand Medicaid to increase health care coverage. In an interview with CBSN's Elaine Quijano, Gillum explained why single-payer health care would be impractical for Florida to adopt unilaterally. \"I've endorsed 'Medicare for All' at the federal level,\" he said. \"I do not believe a state can accomplish that on its own. If a state did, it would probably find itself bankrupt pretty quickly, and largely because in a state like Florida, as you get the sickest pool coming to one location, the system would collapse under the weight of it.\" Should a larger group of states decide to marshal their economic leverage, however, Gillum thinks \"Medicare for All\" would be worth considering.\u00a0 \"If states were to make that move, the options might be to find a consortium of states who might be able to come together -- cull together the buying power and the negotiating power of a collection of states to figure out whether or not we could in fact increase access and lower costs,\" he told Quijano in an interview in Jacksonville, Florida Thursday.\u00a0 Gillum also noted that it would be \"quite a lift\" to convince the GOP-led Florida legislature to pass such a plan. As governor, he plans to focus on a less ambitious plan to expand Medicaid, which would provide health insurance coverage for poorer Floridians. \"We're going to expand access to health care by expanding Medicaid in my state,\" he said.\u00a0 \"I think folks here in Florida are going to want to know that I've got a pragmatic way of moving that policy forward,\" he told Quijano. Still, it's unlikely that the Florida state House would pass a Medicaid expansion either.\u00a0 Gillum's opponent ,Ron DeSantis, told Quijano Thursday that he supports healthcare protections for pre-existing conditions. \"If there happens to be a change in federal law and if there are people who fall through the cracks, I would sign a bill to take care of them,\" he said. However,\u00a0DeSantis has not unveiled a health care plan, and his\u00a0issues page\u00a0does not include health care.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is fudging the facts regarding jobs, the economy and the social safety net as he seeks to dismiss his critics in recent days. He claims GDP growth has exceeded the unemployment rate for the first time in a century, when in fact is it has done so repeatedly since the 1940s. He also insists that Social Security and Medicare are becoming stronger under his watch when the most recent government report shows the financial condition of both programs worsening. On the economy, his claims of spurring the strongest U.S. growth ever fall short of reality. The statements -- many of them made through Mr. Trump's twitter handle -- were among varied misrepresentations from the White House coming in a remarkable week after an anonymous senior official went public about an effort within the administration to thwart his agenda. The president also faces the special counsel's continuing Russia investigation, fewer than 60 days before November's midterm elections. A look at the rhetoric and how it compares with reality: MR. TRUMP: \"The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!\" -- tweet Monday. MR. TRUMP: \"We are breaking all Jobs and Economic Records.\" \u2014 tweet Saturday. MR. TRUMP: \"The Economy is booming like never before, Jobs are at Historic Highs.\" \u2014 tweet Thursday. THE FACTS: The economy, though healthy, has been in better shape at many times in the past. GDP growth has surpassed the unemployment rate multiple times since the 1940s.\u00a0 The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years! Economic growth reached 4.2 percent at an annualized rate in the second quarter, while the unemployment rate stands at 3.9 percent. Yet GDP growth has exceeded the unemployment rate more than a dozen times since the late 1940s, such as during the economic expansions of the 1950s and the late 1990s.\u00a0 So far, the economy is growing at a modest rate compared with previous economic expansions. In the late 1990s, growth topped 4 percent for four straight years, from 1997 through 2000. In the 1980s expansion, growth even reached 7.2 percent in 1984. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Adviser, told reporters in a weekly briefing on Monday that economic growth had not surpassed the jobless rate in the last 10 -- not 100 -- years, suggesting that Mr. Trump may have accidentally added a \"0\" to his tweet.\u00a0 The unemployment rate of 3.9 percent is strong but it's not at the best point ever. It is near an 18-year low. The all-time low came in 1953, when unemployment fell to 2.5 percent during the Korean War. Meanwhile, a greater percentage of Americans held jobs in 2000 than now. As a whole, the economy is in its 10th year of growth, a recovery that began under President Barack Obama, who inherited the Great Recession. The data show that the falling unemployment rate and gains in home values reflect the duration of the recovery, rather than any major changes made since 2017 by the Trump administration. MR. TRUMP: \"We're saving Social Security. The Democrats will destroy Social Security. We're saving Medicare. The Democrats want to destroy Medicare. ...We will keep it going. We're making it stronger. We're making Social Security stronger.\" \u2014 remarks Wednesday. MR. TRUMP, promoting Montana Republican Matt Rosendale's Senate campaign: \"I'm going to protect your Social Security. We're going to take care of your Social Security. Matt Rosendale is going to make sure we're not touching your Social Security and your Medicare is only going one way. That's stronger.\" \u2014 remarks at Montana rally Thursday. THE FACTS: Mr. Trump hasn't made Medicare and Social Security stronger. The government's annual trustees reports on the programs released in June shows the financial condition of both worsening significantly since last year. The projected insolvency for Social Security stayed unchanged \u2014 in 2034 \u2014 but Medicare's moved three years closer, to 2026. Both programs also will start tapping their reserves this year, meaning that income from payroll taxes and interest earned by the Social Security and Medicare trust funds will no longer cover costs. That threshold was still a few years away in last year's report. As a result, Social Security and Medicare will need a $416 billion transfer from the government's general revenues this year, when the federal deficit is already rising. Last year's Republican tax bill, which cut taxes on Social Security benefits, helped exacerbate the shortfall. So did the Trump-supported repeal of the individual mandate in so-called Obamacare. The repeal promises to increase the number of people without health insurance and therefore Medicare payments for uncompensated medical care. Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise not to cut Social Security or Medicare, but he hasn't offered a blueprint for either program. Democrats want to expand the social safety net by spending more. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has argued that tax cuts, rolling back regulations and better trade agreements could boost economic growth and help stabilize Medicare and Social Security. But nonpartisan government experts who produced the annual Social Security assessment didn't seem to accept that, forecasting \"sustained moderate economic growth.\" MR. TRUMP: \"'Ford has abruptly killed a plan to sell a Chinese-made small vehicle in the U.S. because of the prospect of higher U.S. Tariffs.' CNBC. This is just the beginning. This car can now be BUILT IN THE U.S.A. and Ford will pay no tariffs!\" \u2014 tweet Sunday. THE FACTS: It's not true that Trump's taxes on Chinese imports will now mean the Focus Active can be built in the U.S. \u201cFord has abruptly killed a plan to sell a Chinese-made small vehicle in the U.S. because of the prospect of higher U.S. Tariffs.\u201d CNBC.  This is just the beginning. This car can now be BUILT IN THE U.S.A. and Ford will pay no tariffs! Citing Trump's new tariffs, Ford on Aug. 31 said it was dropping plans to ship the hatchback vehicle to the United States from China. But Ford said in a statement Sunday \"it would not be profitable to build the Focus Active in the U.S.,\" given forecast yearly sales below 50,000. For now, that means Ford simply won't sell the vehicle in the United States.",

            "article_content": "Health care was the top issue for voters in Tuesday's midterm elections. Just under half of surveyed voters\u00a0mentioned it, while 70 percent said the health care system needs major changes. Voters' fears about health care may even have propelled the Democrats to win control of the House of Representatives: More than half of voters surveyed said the Democratic Party would be better able to protect people with preexisting health conditions. But now the hard work begins. Partisan lines are still solid, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and likely new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi digging in on opposite sides of almost everything. In the end, health care improvements for consumers will likely be slow in coming and incremental, happening one issue at a time, if any happen at all.\u00a0 Here's a look at three of the most important issues that motivated voters and what lies ahead for each: Despite just about every candidate from either party and President Donald Trump saying they would support coverage for people with preexisting conditions, the new Congress may have to deal fairly soon with a serious threat to this important protection.  In September, a federal judge heard arguments from 18 state attorneys general and two governors in a lawsuit designed to eliminate the Affordable Care Act once and for all. The state AGs argue that because the new tax law eliminated the individual mandate fine, the mandate is deemed unconstitutional and the entire law is no longer valid.\u00a0 In June, the Trump administration decided not to defend the ACA against this lawsuit, and it agreed in part that protections for people with preexisting conditions should be overturned.  Now that the midterms are in the past, the judge's ruling is expected soon. If he decides in favor of the argument, all protections under the ACA, including protections for preexisting conditions, would no longer exist.  Congress may be able to pass bipartisan legislation that would negate any positive ruling in the suit, which could proceed to a Supreme Court that has two new sitting justices. Legislation could create preexisting condition protections separate from the ACA. But Democrats and Republicans have differed in the past on how to get that done.\u00a0 And Mr. Trump's executive orders expanding the use of short-term and association health care policies that would not have to provide ACA protections -- including coverage for preexisting conditions -- continue to undermine the health care law.  Some analysts say this is an issue that Democrats and Republicans can come together on to pass effective legislation. Lots of ideas are on the table, such as introducing laws that would regulate the rebates drug companies give to third-party pharmacy benefit managers, which are widely blamed for inflating drug prices.  The one big sticking point? Direct government negotiation with pharmaceutical companies through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.  Last month, President Trump announced a plan under which the federal government would use a global pricing index to price the drugs administered by physicians and paid for through Medicare Part B. The U.S. pays far more than other industrialized nations for these drugs.\u00a0 It's a bold move. But by using a price index, the Trump administration skirts the issue of negotiating directly with drug companies, who maintain a large lobbying effort and make generous campaign contributions. He's taking the price index route, even though on the 2016 campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised that his administration would implement negotiation with drug companies. As a result, drug prices became a focal point of the midterms. And so did Big Pharma's money. This year, 72 percent of candidates on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee list rejected corporate PAC money, including funds from drug companies, according to Roll Call.\u00a0 This may signal that those elected won't be reluctant to take on the giant industry. And in her post-election remarks, Pelosi pledged that Democrats would take \"very, very strong legislative action\" to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Medicaid expansion was a calling card of Obamacare. After court battles, states were allowed to decide whether they would loosen income restrictions to offer extended Medicaid coverage to low-income individuals as described under the law. A total of 18 states decided against Medicaid expansion. In the midterms, however, three of those states -- Idaho, Nebraska and Utah -- passed ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid. In three more states -- Kansas, Maine and Wisconsin -- voters elected governors who supported Medicaid expansion, increasing the likelihood that these states will also offer the extra benefits.  While these are state initiatives, the results send a message to Congress that many voters still favor ACA Medicaid expansion.\u00a0 Along those lines, 28 states also have taken actions to strengthen their ACA individual insurance marketplaces, according to a report from the Commonwealth Fund. These actions include implementing reinsurance programs and rules that limit or ban the health care plans the Trump administration recently introduced that don't comply with the ACA.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic push to highlight health care in the midterm elections is evident in Elissa Slotkin's newest ad -- her second of the general election -- which was released Thursday. It tells of her mother's stage 4 ovarian cancer and promises voters Slotkin will fight to preserve health care coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. She's running to unseat incumbent Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Michigan, in Michigan's 8th Congressional District.\u00a0 In the 60-second ad, Slotkin makes a personal plea to voters, reminding them that health care is on the ballot this election cycle. \u00a0Her mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2009 and passed away in 2011. \"This is a story about my mom, but it could be about anyone's mom,\" Slotkin says in the ad, while looking at pictures of her mother at their family farm. \"She had survived breast cancer when I was very young, but her pre-existing condition hung over all of us when we lived here at the farm.\" Here's the ad: Slotkin tells voters in the ad about how her mother lost her job -- and her health insurance -- and had no health insurance when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer several years later. Slotkin moved up the date of her wedding to ensure her mother could see her married. The ad shows video footage of her mother at the reception, telling her daughter and new husband, \"Seeing the love between the two of you is the thing that get me through the terrible months in the hospital.\" The ad, which is a six-figure buy running on Detroit broadcasts, concludes with Slotkin criticizing Bishop for his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. \"So, when I saw Congressman Bishop smiling at the White House after voting to gut protections for pre-existing conditions, something inside me broke,\" Slotkin said. \"I'm running for Congress, and I approve this message because Mr. Bishop, that's dereliction of duty and it's a fireable offense.\" While Slotkin narrates this portion of the ad, video footage of Bishop smiling at the White House on May 4, 2017 plays.\u00a0 Health care is polling as one of the main issues concerning voters this election cycle, and Senate and House Democrats running for re-election are emphasizing their commitment to supporting coverage of patients with pre-existing conditions in their ads.\u00a0Earlier this week, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, released an ad that depicts him firing a shotgun at the GOP attorneys' general lawsuit signed by his opponent, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Their lawsuit aims to dismantle the ACA. In an interview with CBS News, Slotkin said that in the time period between her mother's diagnosis and her death, it didn't occur to her to run for office. But she said that seeing Bishop smiling at the Rose Garden ceremony, celebrating legislation that would have repealed the nation's health care law motivated her to run. \"I turned to my husband and said, 'No you don't get to do this,'\" Sloktin said. Bishop \"has forgotten that his, you know, boss[es] are the people who elected him, and his job description is to better their lives. He's doing the opposite.\" Troy Hudson, Bishop's campaign manager, responded to the ad in a statement saying that Slotkin is \"lying about Bishop's record.\" \"I am sorry about her mother's passing,\" Hudson said in the statement. \"Families have to deal with unfortunate situations.\u00a0 But unfortunately Elissa Slotkin is lying about Mike Bishop's record. Mike Bishop voted for a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act that kept existing preconditions. He was also an original cosponsor to the Pre-Existing Conditions Protection Act (HR1211) that reaffirmed the guaranteed health care access to those with preexisting conditions.\" Slotkin, who served in Iraq and spent 14 years in the national security field, said voters routinely express their concerns about the rising costs of health care and prescription drug prices at her campaign events. She told CBS News that she supports allowing people the option to buy into Medicare, which would control their cost of prescription drugs and health care. \"I think there are lots of people who are really \u2013 they are pretty happy with their private insurance, so the way to go at this is a buy into Medicare, no matter what age you are,\" Slotkin said. Democrats need to flip 23 seats to gain the majority in the House. CBS News rates this race as competitive. Michigan's 8th congressional district, which President Donald Trump won in 2016 by almost seven points, includes Lansing and a portion of Northern Oakland County. Slotkin said her campaign has spent time with Trump voters and added that her campaign's fastest-growing volunteer category is Republican women over 50 years of age in the suburbs of Detroit. \"We now have events that are thrown by Republican women for Republican women,\" Sloktin noted. In addition to these events, her campaign has started the \"Common Ground Breakfast,\" where Democratic, Republican and independent women voters come together to discuss issues and to practice civility when discussing these issues. Slotkin said voters approached her about the \"tone\" of politics, and she added that this type of event is her effort to bring people from both sides of the political spectrum together. \"We have a place to go because we can come together and talk about things we have in common,\" Slotkin said. \"That is important for people to believe that we can get to a place where we can have civil, reasonable, responsible discussion again among people with very different views.\" Recalling her time in Iraq, she said political affiliation did not matter because the primary mission was to protect U.S. military members and the U.S. homeland. Slotkin served under both Republican and Democratic administrations. \"That spirit is how I was raised,\" Slotkin said, \"and it's that spirit that I believe is completely gone from our domestic political conversation to the detriment of our country.\" CBS News reporter covering the Senate.",

            "article_content": "If you're one of the many American progressives cheering on the performance of your new political rock star, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, look around: Many of the people cheering with you are Republicans. Ocasio-Cortez's 14-point victory over 10-term incumbent Democrat Joe Crowley was certainly impressive. Her performance since then? Not so much. The GOP have branded her a gaffe machine, Democrats on Capitol Hill her urging her \"to do things differently,\" and her stumbling media appearances have sparked references to the \"P\" word: \"Palin.\" Yes, it's that bad. There's a lot to like about the bold, outspoken battler from the Bronx who, until just a few months ago was still tending bar.\u00a0 She's enthusiastic, she's attractive, she has a degree in economics from Boston University, and she's unapologetic in her (self-described) socialist views.\u00a0 Unfortunately, Ocasio-Cortez doesn't appear to have test-driven her campus socialism in the real world. And as a result, her media performances under even the most tepid of questioning have been less than productive. In the six short weeks since her upset primary win, Ocasio-Cortez has: She also compared the costs of the GOP tax cuts (less than $2 trillion over the next 10 years) to the costs of her Medicare For All approach, estimated at around $32 trillion over a decade. Then to make matters worse, she added this during a CNN interview: \"Americans have the sticker shock of healthcare as it is, and what we're also not talking about is why aren't we incorporating the cost of all the funeral expenses of those who died because they can't afford access to healthcare? That is part of the cost of our system.\" Yes \u2014 what about all the savings we'll have under #MedicareForAll once people stop dying? After one of Ocasio-Cortez's recent unforced errors, establishment D.C. moderate Norm Ornstein tweeted that she is \"not ready for prime time.\" This is a person not ready for prime time, certainly not ready for Congress. She should stop campaigning & do a crash course on basics, including economics and foreign policy. Otherwise, she will stumble badly out of the blocks and do major damage. Early impressions hard to erase https://t.co/DjoWPkT50t Ocasio-Cortez's gaffes have become so frequent \u2014 and harmful \u2014 that a cottage industry has risen up on the Right to trumpet them. She's become a staple of talk radio and clips of her less-than-flattering moments frequent Fox News. Websites like the Washington Free Beacon and the Daily Caller delight in highlighting the latest misstep from the new poster person for American Progressivism. Republicans would love nothing more than for Democrats to spend the 2018 midterm campaign defending socialist policies.\u00a0 Candidates who promote policies like single-payer health care, or free college tuition or government-guaranteed jobs for all know they're going to face the Margaret Thatcher question eventually: How do you pay for it? Thatcher's famous observation was that \"the trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.\" Many Americans perceive themselves as the \"other people\" in that scenario and so they want to know how much all this \"free\" stuff is going to cost. And this is the Ocasio-Cortez Effect: Americans are suspicious of the idea of socialism (though they are fine with \"socialist\" policies like welfare and Medicare), and typical voters tend to dismiss its advocates as na\u00efve. The error-filled answers and shaky logic offered by Ocasio-Cortez confirm the assumption that, however compassionate these progressive programs are, they have no idea how to pay for them. The fact that Ocasio-Cortez still doesn't have a coherent answer when asked how she'll pay for all the new spending she wants reflects poorly on her \u2014 but is even more damaging to her socialist ideals. This may be one reason her influence among Democratic voters already appears to be waning. Last month, she and her progressive mentor Bernie Sanders campaigned hard for progressives Cori Bush and Brent Welder in the Kansas Democratic primary. Both lost. In a Politico article entitled \"Down Goes Socialism,\" Bill Scher notes that it was Hillary Clinton, and not Ocasio-Cortez, whose endorsement carried the most weight in Michigan last week. \"Clinton's late robocall in support of Haley Stevens helped take Stevens from second place in polls to an election night victory in the suburban 11th District, a top Democratic target, while Fayrouz Saad, backed by Ocasio-Cortez, placed fourth.\" In fact, Democratic establishment candidates have been on a roll since the Ocasio-Cortez upset. Could it be that her high-profile missteps are convincing candidates to remain more moderate? That the net result of Ocasio-Cortez's candidacy is fewer progressive candidates in November? It could be the case that Ocasio-Cortez's vision of the Democratic Party as a bastion of European-style socialism is their inevitable future. Or it could be, as her fellow Democrat Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Wisconsin quipped: \"Yes, it's the future of the Democratic Party \u2014 in the Bronx.\"\u00a0 But if democratic socialism prevails in the short-term, it will be despite \u2014 not because of \u2014 the Ocasio-Cortez Effect.

            "article_content": "Boston City Council member Ayanna Pressley has unseated 10-term incumbent Rep. Michael Capuano, in a surprise upset in the Massachusetts Democratic\u00a0primary\u00a0Tuesday. Pressley, the first African-American woman elected to the Boston City Council in 2009 was considered by many to be an outsider candidate, drawing comparisons to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young democratic socialist who shocked the Democratic establishment by\u00a0defeating New York Rep. Joe Crowley\u00a0in his primary in June. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday night, \"Congratulations to my sister in service, @AyannaPressley, on continuing her historic path into Congress tonight. Let's push together to make Medicare for All, tuition free college, & living wages a reality in America - all without corporate PAC money.\" Capuano, a vestige of Boston's white ethnic political machine, was first elected in 1998. He has been a reliable liberal vote in the House for nearly 20 years, and is a longtime supporter of progressive policies such as Medicare for All. Pressley argued in her campaign that Capuano represents an old guard of politics, and it's time for a change. The race for Capuano's seat was less about policy issues than representation -- Massachusett's 7th Congressional District is the only one in the state with more non-whites than whites. Capuano was endorsed by prominent Massachusetts figures, including former Gov. Deval Patrick, the state's first black governor. He also had the support of the Congressional Black Caucus. He raised twice as much money as Pressley. However, Pressley had the endorsement of popular state Attorney General Maura Healey. Pressley is likely to become the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts in November, since there are no Republican candidates in the race.\u00a0 Pressley may be considered an outsider by virtue of who she is. Capuano is a white man who was born and raised in the district, and served as mayor of Somerville before he was elected to his congressional seat. Pressley is originally from Chicago, Illinois. As a black woman, Pressley is challenging the traditional political hierarchy that has defined Boston politics for decades. But both Pressley and Capuano admit there's likely no difference between them in terms of the way they'll vote in Congress, and moreover, neither one has expressed outright opposition against Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Still, Pressley joins Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida in the ranks of progressive, non-white politicians who represent demographic change and perspective in the Democratic Party. Pressley was endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez, and has been profiled in several news outlets. Capuano may have had the name recognition, but Pressley had the momentum.

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic candidate for Congress Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spent time campaigning last week in a state many progressives wouldn't consider a campaign priority:\u00a0Kansas.\u00a0 CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan sat down with Vermont's Sanders, a well-known face in Democratic politics, and New York's \u00a0casio-Cortez, a rising star in the party after she defeated incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley, as they stumped in the Sunflower State. Brennan asked why they would spend time campaigning for candidates in a red state like Kansas that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump.\u00a0 \"Well, Margaret, I happen to believe, passionately, that there really is not a blue-state, red-state tradition in this country. I think there's a lot of mythology attached to that,\" Sanders said.\u00a0 \"People, they believe that healthcare is a right,\" he continued. \"People believe we should raise the minimum wage to a living wage. People do not think, as Trump does, that we should give a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent, but in fact we have got to demand that the rich start paying their fair share of taxes. Whether you're in Kansas or the Bronx or in Vermont, we have common interests and common aspirations and we have got to fight for an America that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.\" Ocasio-Cortez, who ran a campaign on a platform that included Medicare for all and free college tuition, said a populist-style approach \"absolutely\" brings out new voters.\u00a0 \"In fact, we start -- we found this here in New York, back home. We expanded the electorate 68 percent over the last off-year midterm primary,\" she said. \"So for us, this is about inspiring people to the polls, giving them something to vote for, creating hope for this nation, and knowing that so long as there are working class Americans who believe in a prosperous and just future we will have hope, no matter how red the district.\" In Ocasio-Cortez' case,\u00a0Crowley attributed her win to two factors\u00a0-- what he described as the \"year of the woman\" and the timing of the primary race. Asked if she agrees with that assessment, Ocasio-Cortez emphasized that it was her platform, and the organizing work her campaign did, that paved the way to victory.\u00a0 \"Well, I think that the factors that ultimately created our win was the fact that we had bold commitments and I campaigned on hard commitments of Medicare for all, tuition free public college, ensuring a Green New Deal for our future,\" she said.\u00a0 Pressed on whether she rejects the idea that her gender was a major factor in her victory, Ocasio-Cortez pointed to how a male-dominated Congress can create \"blind spots in our legislation\" on critical issues. \"In this moment, there's a confluence of factors that makes this moment inspiring. Right now more women than ever are running for office and I do think that women want representation in Congress, absolutely,\" she said. \"Congress right now is 80 percent male. And that creates blind spots in our legislation. It means we don't have family leave, we don't have paid maternal and parental leave. It means that we don't get the equal pay that we want. So I think those issues certainly were important.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson conceded defeat to Republican Gov. Rick Scott in the state's bitterly contested Senate race after final official results posted showed Scott ahead of the three-term incumbent by more than 10,000 votes. \"Let me say by no measure do I feel defeated and that's because I've had the privilege of serving the people of Florida and the country for most of my life,\" Nelson, 76,\u00a0said in a video released by his campaign Sunday afternoon. \"I was not victorious but I want to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we fought\" a public office is public trust.\" In a statement, Scott said he spoke to Nelson, who \"graciously conceded.\" Scott said he thanked Nelson \"for his years of public service.\" Florida counties had until noon to file official results with the state following a weeklong machine and hand recount that had triggered allegations of fraud and several lawsuits. State officials will post the official results on Tuesday. The defeat of Nelson brings an end to a now-bygone era in Florida. Nelson had been a Democratic survivor as the GOP ascended into power, hewing to a more moderate tone even as newcomers such as Democratic candidate for governor Andrew Gillum tried to push the party in a more liberal direction. Gillum\u00a0conceded defeat in the state's race for governor to Ron DeSantis on Saturday. Sunday's\u00a0official results showed DeSantis leading by about 33,000 votes out of more than 8.2 million cast. In the Senate race, Scott charged into the race last April at the urging of President Trump and spent more than $60 million of his own money on a series of ads that hammered Nelson as out-of-touch and ineffective. The campaign waged between the two men was more about character, competence and their loyalty to Mr. Trump even though Scott was placed on the defensive about his record on the environment and health care. The weeks leading up to the election were bitter, and it remained that way after it became clear that the race between Nelson and Scott would head to a legally required recount. Scott held a press conference at the governor's mansion suggesting that fraud may be going on in several Democratic-controlled counties. Nelson and the Democrats responded by filing several lawsuits that challenged everything from Scott's authority over the state's election division to deadlines for mail-in ballots. The Nelson campaign managed to secure only one win in court. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker gave voters until 5 p.m. on Saturday to fix their ballots if they haven't been counted because of mismatched signatures. Nearly 5,700 ballots were rejected because signatures on ballot envelopes did not match signatures kept on file by election officials. Walker rejected a request by Democrats to automatically count all the ballots with mismatched signatures. He also rejected a request to waive deadlines for domestic mail-in ballots even if they had been mailed prior to Election Day. Scott, a one-time health care executive and multimillionaire, first jumped into politics eight years ago, when he rode a tea party wave into the governor's office. Term limits prevented him from seeking re-election. \u00a0As the state's chief executive, Scott focused on job creation and turning around Florida's economy after the recession. Nelson and Scott disagreed on issues ranging from gun control to environmental policy to health care. Nelson was a strong supporter of the federal health care overhaul pushed into law by President Barack Obama, while Scott had called for the law to be repealed and replaced. Nelson and his allies ran ads that questioned Scott's ethics, pointing to his ouster as chief executive of health care giant Columbia/HCA amid a federal fraud investigation. Although Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing, the health care conglomerate paid a then-record $1.7 billion fine for Medicare fraud. Democrats also questioned whether Scott had conflicts while governor since both he and his wife invested in companies that do business in Florida, including a subsidiary of the company that owns Florida's largest electric utility. Scott has maintained he does not control his holdings.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are expected to take the House in November, but that victory is dependent on a few key races, primarily in swing districts. However, there are some districts which have been longtime Republican strongholds, but due to demographic changes and urbanization are leaning left in the midterm elections. North Carolina is a swing state, and its 9th Congressional District, which has been represented by a Republican since the 1960s, is one of the most competitive House races this year. Voters must choose between a conservative pastor and a Democratic veteran who promises not vote for Nancy Pelosi to be House minority leader. The outcome of this race could be an indicator of where the country at large is politically, and how the political composition of swing states could be changing. Mark Harris made headlines in May when he defeated incumbent Rep. Robert Pittenger in the Republican primary. Pittenger was hardly a moderate -- he voted in line with President Trump nearly 98 percent of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight. However, Harris, who narrowly lost to Pittenger in 2016, insisted that Pittenger is a member of the Washington swamp. He also promised to support Freedom Caucus co-founder Rep. Jim Jordan as speaker of the House if elected. Harris, a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump, is known for his controversial positions on LGBT rights. As president of the Baptist State Convention in 2012, Harris helped lead the fight for a state constitutional amendment which banned same-sex marriage in the state. This amendment was overturned by the Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges.\u00a0 Harris also supported the controversial \"bathroom bill\" in 2015 that barred transgender individuals from using the bathroom for their gender identity. On his campaign website, Harris touts his role in both of these campaigns, and says he is \"a supporter of our traditional family values.\" Harris has also taken heat for a sermon he gave in 2013 in which he questioned whether having a career was the \"healthiest pursuit\" for women, and said that women should remember their \"core calling\" of being a wife and mother. Harris has said that those words were taken out of context. Unlike in other races, where a far-right candidate is paired with a far-left opponent, McCready is a moderate Democrat. He is small business owner and a Marine veteran, the make and model of the national Democratic Party's preferred candidate for red areas.\u00a0 He has drawn comparisons to Conor Lamb, the Democrat who won a special election race in a rural, Republican-held Pennsylvania district earlier this year. McCready has said that the Affordable Care Act is \"broken,\" and does not support a \"government-run\" system of health care, according to an interview with McClatchy, differing from many other Democratic candidates across the country who support some version of \"Medicare for All.\" The race in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District has attracted prominent political figures on both sides of the aisle. Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen, rallied for Harris earlier this month. Mr. Trump appeared with Harris at a Republican fundraiser at the end of August. Harris also has support from PACs such as the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is aligned with House Republicans, and the National Rifle Association. Meanwhile, McCready has attracted support from South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. McCready has outraised Harris two to one, having raised over $4 million to Harris' $1.6 million. McCready has also been appealing to a broad coalition of voters; issues listed on his campaign website include protecting the Lumbee Indian Tribe, supporting women's rights and voting rights. He criticizes politicians who \"try to disenfranchise African Americans and roll back voting rights\" and \"draw political district lines to pack black people into clusters, silencing their voices.\" The district stretches from southeastern Charlotte to Fayetteville, covering more rural and urban areas. Although it voted for Mr. Trump by 12 points in 2016, if McCready is able to prove his moderate bona fides, and encourage turnout among minority groups, he could turn a red district blue. The CBS News Battleground Tracker rates this race as a \"toss up.\" A recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll found that Democrats are currently on track to gain a 226-seat majority in the midterm elections, although many races are extremely close and it wouldn't take much to move that number in either direction.\u00a0 Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 A two-term state senator who was backed by President Trump but who also promoted his ties to Trump critic Gov. John Kasich won a previously deadlocked congressional special election in Ohio, retaining a coveted open U.S. House seat long held by Republicans. State Sen. Troy Balderson was certified Friday as the voters' pick over Democrat Danny O'Connor, the Franklin County recorder, to complete the unexpired term of former long-time U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi, who retired in January. After final absentee and provisional ballots were counted, Balderson defeated O'Connor by 1,680 votes \u2014 a mere 0.8-percent margin in a district Trump won by 11 points two years ago. The result fell 520 votes outside the window to trigger an automatic recount. Balderson, of Zanesville, and O'Connor, who's from Columbus, must face off again for the full two-year term representing the meandering central Ohio district that stretches from Democrat-heavy Columbus into Trump-supporting suburban and rural areas north and east of Columbus. The race pits a 56-year-old Trump supporter with political experience against a 31-year-old challenger who, if elected, would be the youngest member of Congress. The special election was a test of voter sentiment before November's high-stakes general election, which will decide which political party controls the House. A key issue was the Republican tax cuts, which Balderson embraced in seeking to win the state's wealthiest district and O'Connor criticized as a threat to Medicare and Social Security. Balderson's victory buoys Republicans concerned over how Mr. Trump might be playing among voters, especially in political battleground states such as Ohio. O'Connor's odds were considered long in the gerrymandered district, which has been held by Republicans for nearly 35 years. A third candidate, the Green Party's Joe Manchik, also vied for the seat. He won 1,165 votes, or 0.56 percent of the total. Balderson won while walking a careful line between the Trump-averse traditionalists in his party, including Kasich and Tiberi, and the president's stalwart supporters. The governor, a 2016 presidential contender and among the GOP's most outspoken critics of Mr. Trump, touted his and Balderson's strong working relationship in campaign ads. Kasich is particularly well-known in the district, which he represented for 18 years before Tiberi was elected in 2000. But the popularity that he's maintained statewide has shifted to coming more from Democrats than from Republicans in recent years. Tiberi, who also backed Balderson, was among a group of establishment Republicans who left office or announced their retirements from Congress under Mr. Trump. The support from Kasich and Tiberi was perhaps key, but so was that of Trump, who won the district by 11 percentage points in 2016. The victor in Tuesday's special election is considered to have an advantage headed into the November rematch for a full term, but both major parties are expected to fight hard for the seat over the next several months. Mr. Trump visited Ohio to campaign for Balderson in the days leading up to the special election. In remarks lasting more than an hour at a rally last week, Mr. Trump assailed many critics while arguing Republicans need to control Congress and casting the midterms as a referendum on himself. He defiantly questioned the idea that, historically, the party that controls the White House suffers in the midterms, declaring \"but I say why.\" \"Why would there be a blue wave? I think it could be a red wave,\" Mr.\u00a0Trump said of his party's prospects in November. \"They want to take away what we've given. And we're doing a lot of things people don't even know about.\" The president was back in the battleground state Friday.",

            "article_content": "Democratic senate candidate Rep. Jacky Rosen, of Nevada, is answering the challenge from the Republican incumbent she hopes to unseat, GOP Sen. Dean Heller. The sitting Nevada senator has been calling on her to compare their records on health care.\u00a0 In a new 30-second TV ad running statewide in Nevada as part of the campaigns ongoing seven-figure TV ad buy, Rosen answers the challenge and addresses Heller directly: \"You voted to let insurance companies discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, charge older people more, and take away coverage from 200,000 Nevadans.\" She's responding to a\u00a0Heller ad, in which he tells voters she's done \"nothing\" to fix health care.\u00a0 Rosen campaign manager Danny Kazin told CBS News the Rosen campaign was happy to respond to Heller. \"Dean Heller wants to compare his record of caving to party leaders and special interests to take away health care coverage and protections from hundreds of thousands of Nevadans with Jacky Rosen's record of consistently protecting Nevadans' health care? Challenge accepted,\" Kazin said in a statement. Rosen and Heller have been exchanging accusations since April, and Rosen's campaign ad is the latest shot at Heller. She has called\u00a0Heller a \"spineless\" senator in one ad and compared him to an inflatable tube man for bending to Republican pressure in another.\u00a0 Heller, who after initially criticizing GOP efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last year, saying it would \"harm tens of thousands of Nevadans,\" ultimately voted to support repeal legislation. \u00a0 Even with GOP control of Congress and the presidency, the health care bill Heller co-sponsored with Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act failed. In August, Heller and 10 other Republicans\u00a0introduced legislation to address the issue of pre-existing conditions.\u00a0 The Rosen campaign's health care focus is in line with the Democratic Party's emphasis on health care issues in the midterm elections. In a letter to colleagues earlier this month, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that members of the caucus would be developing legislation to deliver on lowering health care costs and prescription drug prices if Democrats gain control of the House.\u00a0 But it also comes as more liberal Democrats push forward with their own costly \"Medicare for All\" agenda as a means to counter Republican efforts to undermine former President Obama's health care law.\u00a0 The proposal, sponsored Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and backed by 2018 and potential 2020 contenders Sens. Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker, aims to set up a single-payer health care system that would have the government foot much of the bill, increasing government health care spending by a whopping $32 trillion over the next 10 years. The division in party focus could set up a potentially confusing midterm message.\u00a0 Nevertheless, health care appears to be a key voting issue for voters in the midterm elections. A\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found last month that three in four voters say a candidate must agree with them on health care in order to get their vote in 2018. \u00a0 Jack Turman contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Control of the Senate hinges in part on a race in Missouri. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is locked in a close contest with the state's attorney general, Josh Hawley. Missouri voted for President Trump in 2016 and has grown more conservative over time. CBS News contributor and host of NPR's Morning Edition, Steve Inskeep, took a road trip down historic Route 66 for three meals with Missouri voters: breakfast in a small town, lunch in a suburb and dinner in a city.\u00a0 The trip started before dawn at Shelly's Route 66 Caf\u00e9 in the small town of Cuba, Missouri \u2013 where friends gather, and strangers are made to feel welcome, their slogan goes.  There we found a group of small business owners, veterans, and retirees who all support the president. However, Sue Greenstreet is feeling dread. She's on Medicare.  \"If they put everyone on Medicare, we seniors will be next in the line for bullet in the head\u2026 because they can't afford Medicare for everyone\u2026 it would not work,\" Greenstreet said.   Across the table, Diane Nickel fears social unrest.  \"There's riots and people have become so divided. Instead of being American citizens, they decided to either be one side or the other. I think that that is just horrible,\" Nickel said.   Cuba is decorated with murals showing famous moments in the town's history, like an 1864 battle during the Civil War. It's a town that knows something about a divided country. Ferguson, Missouri, a red area of the map, is where Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in 2014. Cathy and Jerome Jenkins kept their restaurant open during the protests that followed. Today, their street has recovered and the Jenkins would like to see more black-owned businesses. \"My concerns about the community would be equal opportunities,\" Jerome said.  \"If you've ever just went in to open something', there's so many papers, there's so many things you've got to do. There's so many taxes you have to file every month. It's like the system is made to be difficult,\" Cathy said, sounding a bit more like a Republican than a Democrat. \"I don't want anyone ever to think that I think a Republican can't help me\u2026.It does sound like we have a few things in common, right?\"  Just not their view of Obamacare, which cut the Jenkins' insurance costs. They want to elect a Democratic Congress to stop the president's attacks on it.  \"He's doing things that I cannot even explain, so it's almost hard for me to speak because I can't believe that anybody else doesn't see it!\" Jerome said.\u00a0 At St. Louis's Schlafly Tap Room, Inskeep met flight attendant Jana Wayne, who didn't vote in 2016, and bartender Shea Bandera, who voted for Donald Trump. Both say he's done a better job than they expected. But for Bandera, there's one thing he doesn't agree with the president on: climate change. \"It's already affecting us right now. I mean, we're having record floods, we're having record hurricanes,\" Bandera said.  Over at the bar at Schlafly's, Inskeep met a progressive couple who favors Democrats, but they know much of their conservative state will not.  \"The president is encouraging lack of empathy. Like, lack of empathy, lack of respect,\" Karen Clodfelter said.  \"This isn't a zero sum world that we live in,\" her, partner John Shepherd, said of what he hopes Republicans will understand. \"And it doesn't have to be that way, yet it seems as though it is. If I have a primary motivator it's that everyone's lives should be better. Not just mine \u2013 everyone's.\"  We'll find out soon which party gets their voters to show up in Missouri. President Trump will be holding rallies in the state twice before Election Day.",

            "article_content": "By Anthony Salvanto, Jennifer De Pinto, Kabir Khanna, Fred Backus and Jennie Kamin Tight contests dominate the Senate landscape: In Florida, incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott are tied among likely voters, 46 percent to 46 percent including those who have cast ballots already. Scott, the sitting governor, gets positive marks from voters on his handling of the recent hurricane and benefits from Republicans reporting that they're more likely to vote than the Democrats who haven't already.\u00a0 Nelson's support, meanwhile, is underpinned by voters who place health care atop their issues list. The Republicans have a favorable map in their effort to hold their Senate majority, and winning two or three of these states would probably put them in strong position to hold it. Democrats would probably need wins in all three to have a good shot at taking the Senate. Health care concerns have helped Democrat Kyrsten Sinema to a slight three-point advantage over Republican Martha McSally, 47 percent to 44 percent. Sinema does well with voters who say health care is a very important concern and is also helped by nine percent of Republicans who say they're backing her \u2014 it's hardly an overwhelming number, but it could be essential for a Democrat in a Republican-leaning state like Arizona. But Republican chances of holding on to their Senate majority \u2013 or even adding to it \u2013 are helped by the prospect of picking up a seat in Indiana, where Republican Mike Braun leads incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly, 46 percent to 43 percent. In Indiana, where many voters say that agriculture plays a role in their economy, three-quarters of Republicans feel that new tariffs will ultimately lead to better trade deals for the U.S. President Trump appears to be a large factor in these states. In all of them, large majorities say their vote for Senate will be either to support or oppose the president. Most voters in all three states rate health care as a very important issue. In particular, views on what could happen to coverage of pre-existing conditions is strongly linked to vote choice. As has long been the case nationally, voters in these states think insurance companies should be required to cover pre-existing issues.\u00a0 In all these states, big majorities of voters think the Democrats would force that requirement. Also, more think the Republicans would let insurance companies charge more or end requirement than force the requirement. Views of which party is better on Medicare, generally, are strongly correlated with vote. In a heavily partisan election environment, voters have sharply different views of the groups each party represents. Partisans on each side believe the other party is representing people of fundamentally different culture and values \u2013 not simply representing those with policy differences.\u00a0 Republicans are more likely to be seen as putting interests of wealthy and corporations ahead of working people. Democrats are seen as only mixed in this regard. Democrats are seen, especially by Republicans, as prioritizing the interests of recent immigrants over those of longer-term residents and citizens. The CBS News 2018 Battleground Tracker is conducted by YouGov, an online polling company. The margin of error in Arizona is 4.1; in Indiana is 3.7; in Florida is 4. The respondents were selected to be representative of likely voters in terms of age, race, gender, and education. The polls were fielded between October 23\u201326, 2018.

            "article_content": "As\u00a0health care\u00a0tends to top the list of issues voters are concerned about in the 2018 Senate midterm elections, Wisconsin Senate candidate Leah Vukmir, a Republican, released a statement Friday saying she supports coverage options for people with pre-existing conditions amid growing pressure from her Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin. Baldwin is one of 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election in a state that President Trump won in 2016. She supports a Medicare-for-All approach, which Vukmir, a nurse, criticized in her statement. Vukmir says that Baldwin favors a \"government takeover of healthcare\" that is not in the best interest of Wisconsinites. \"She thinks Washington knows best \u2013 even though here in Wisconsin we had solutions for those with pre-existing conditions before it was cool to take care of people with pre-existing conditions,\" Vukmir noted, though she offered no specific solution in her statement. Wisconsin Democrats argued that Vukmir's actions suggest otherwise, that electing her could move Republicans closer to removing protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions. \"The reality is that Leah Vukmir supports three separate Republican efforts to gut protections for the 133 million Americans who have pre-existing conditions, and Vice President Mike Pence himself\u00a0yesterday admitted\u00a0that he needs Vukmir in the Senate to be the deciding vote to pass a Republican repeal plan that would gut pre-existing condition protections, strip coverage away from millions, and let insurance companies charge older Americans more,\" Brad Bainum, Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson, said in a statement. Vukmir's statement comes a few days before hearings begin in Texas on a lawsuit filed by 20 attorneys general that aims to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA) after the individual mandate was repealed last year in the Republican led tax bill. One of the attorneys general on the lawsuit is Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is running to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri. Multiple Senate Democrats, including Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-North Dakota, and McCaskill, have made health care a central issue of their campaigns and have attacked their Republican opponents for threatening to take away pre-existing conditions. Sen. Heitkamp has released an ad highlighting her support for protecting patients with pre-existing\u00a0 conditions. Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nevada, who is running against Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, released an ad criticizing Heller's vote to repeal the ACA, which included guarantees from insurance companies for people with pre-existing conditions, last year. Under mounting Democratic and electoral pressure, Republicans have embraced health care. Hawley wrote an op-ed earlier this month stating his support for insurance guarantees to cover those with pre-existing conditions. In her statement, Vukmir expressed a similar position and noted there are \"better solutions for healthcare.\" \"Make no mistake about it: patients with pre-existing conditions should be covered,\" Vukmir, who supports a full repeal of the ACA, said. \"People shouldn't buy in to Tammy Baldwin's lie that taking care of those who need pre-existing coverage and providing all Wisconsinites with more affordable options are mutually exclusive.\" Democratic groups have consistently pressed Vukmir and other Republican candidates on pre-existing conditions. Before the Wisconsin primary, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) released a statement criticizing Vukmir and her Republican primary opponent Kevin Nicholson. \"Republicans like Kevin Nicholson and Leah Vukmir will use every tool they have \u2014 from the Senate to the courts \u2014 in order to increase health care costs for hard working Americans and threaten critical coverage for pre-existing conditions,\" said DSCC spokesman David Bergstein.

            "article_content": "CHERRY HILL, N.J. \u2014 The number of women running for the U.S. House of Representatives set a record Thursday, the vast majority of them Democrats motivated by angst over President Trump and policies of the Republican-controlled Congress. Their ranks will continue to grow, with candidate filing deadlines still to come in more than half the states. In many places, women are running for congressional seats that have never had a female representative. \"It's about time,\" said Kara Eastman of Nebraska, one of two Democrats vying to challenge a GOP incumbent in a district centered in Omaha. A surge of women into this year's midterm elections had been expected since the Women's March demonstrations nationwide just after Mr. Trump's inauguration in January 2017. Numbers analyzed by The Associated Press show that momentum is continuing. After Virginia released its candidate list Thursday, a total of 309 women from the two major parties have filed candidacy papers to run for the House. That tops the previous record of 298 in 2012. The AP analyzed data going back to 1992 from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University and did its own review of candidate information released by the states. While just over half the nation's population is female, four out of every five members of the U.S. House are men. The women's candidacies won't necessarily change that. They still have to survive party primaries and win the general election, often against an incumbent with name recognition and a large reservoir of campaign cash. Even with the record numbers, women are still outnumbered by male candidates. But experts say the sheer number of women running combined with so many House seats open due to retirements or resignations provides one of the best opportunities for women to make real gains in terms of representation and a change in priorities. Many of the female candidates have focused their campaign messages on health care, education, early childhood development, family leave and workplace equality. Eastman said she was motivated by Republican attempts to cut health coverage for low-income people and rollbacks of environmental protections. She decided to run after her mother, who has since died, was diagnosed with cancer for the fifth time and saw her prescription drug prices soar even though she was covered by Medicare. \"It's a great thing for me to show my 16-year-old daughter,\" Eastman, who runs a children's health care nonprofit, said of her candidacy. Mikie Sherrill spent years in the Navy flying helicopters before leaving the military for a career as a federal prosecutor. For her first foray into politics, she chose this year to challenge Republican Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, a powerful lawmaker who serves as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and was first elected in 1994. Frelinghuysen has since announced his retirement, creating a bigger opening for Sherrill. \"After a lifetime of service and taking numerous oaths to support and defend the Constitution, when I saw that our democracy seemed to be under attack, I felt called upon to serve again and felt a responsibility to serve my country again,\" Sherrill said. She is a leading contender in the Democratic primary and could be part of a wave of women running in Republican-leaning districts. In Indiana, for example, women are running in each of the state's nine congressional districts \u2014 only two of which are currently represented by Democrats. Not all the women running are Democrats. Tiffany Shedd, one of four Republicans in a primary for the chance to unseat Democratic Rep. Tom O'Halleran in a rural Arizona district, said she entered the race after she told her husband the district needed someone better. He responded that he knew an ideal candidate \u2014 a \"coward\" who wouldn't run. When she realized he meant her, she took up the challenge. Shedd said she's glad to see so many women running, even if most of them are on the other side of the aisle. \"I hope that we eventually live in a world where there's no articles written about that because it's no longer a thing,\" she said. A previous surge of women running for Congress came in 1992, in the wake of Anita Hill's testimony alleging sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas, who was then a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate committee weighing his nomination was all-male. That year was labeled the \"Year of the Woman\" because women were elected to the U.S. House and Senate in record numbers. In recent years, the number of women in Congress has held steady in large part because the number of women running hasn't increased substantially from year to year. Currently, there are 83 women in the U.S. House, out of 435 seats. Campaigns for the House aren't the only ones drawing high interest from female candidates this year. Forty women are running so far in governors' races, a total that already surpassed the previous record of 34 in 1994. And 29 women are on ballots for U.S. Senate races, a number that will grow as filing deadlines approach in more states. The record number of female Senate candidates is 40, set in 2016.",

            "article_content": "Rhode Island's Democratic governor faces a spirited but poorly funded challenge in Wednesday's primary, while the mayor of the state's second-largest city is seeking the GOP nomination for his second shot at the governor's seat in November. First, he has to defeat a state lawmaker making her first gubernatorial run. Voters in Rhode Island are also selecting nominees for U.S. Senate, U.S. House, lieutenant governor and some key mayoral races in a rare Wednesday vote. Polls close at 8 p.m. Gov. Gina Raimondo has been making the case for a second term by highlighting the state's improving economic fortunes, including a falling unemployment rate, as well as new job training programs and free community college tuition started during her tenure. She's being challenged in the Democratic primary by former Secretary of State Matt Brown, who last held office over a decade ago. He has been pushing himself as the grassroots alternative and has been hammering Raimondo for her close corporate ties. Brown is running to Raimondo's left on a Bernie Sanders-type platform of Medicare for All, tuition-free college and a $15 minimum wage. Raimondo has raised $7.7 million, 20 times Brown's total. The campaign has taken a negative turn in recent days. Raimondo released an ad attacking Brown last week, accusing him of \"apparent laundering of campaign contributions\" the last time he ran and \"stiffing\" his campaign workers. Brown's campaign has sent a cease-and-desist letter calling on Raimondo and her campaign to retract the \"false attacks\" in the ad.\u00a0 On the Republican side, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, who ran in 2014 as the GOP nominee against Raimondo, is the front runner. Fung was the first Chinese-American mayor in the state. His opponent, Rep. Patricia Morgan, leads the tiny House minority caucus in the overwhelmingly Democratic General Assembly. Fung came in 4.5 points behind Raimondo in a three-way race in 2014. Wednesday's winners are expected to face another three-way race Nov. 6, including former Republican lawmaker Joe Trillo, who chaired President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Rhode Island, running as an independent. The most closely watched down-ticket race is for lieutenant governor, which pits incumbent Democrat Dan McKee against self-described progressive state lawmaker Aaron Regunberg. The position has few official duties, but officeholders have used it as a way to advance certain causes on a statewide level. In congressional races, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Rep. David Cicilline are not expected to face serious trouble in their primaries. Rep. Jim Langevin is unopposed in the Democratic primary. Nearly half of all 782,000 Rhode Island voters are unaffiliated with a party and may choose to vote in either primary. Around 308,000 voters are registered Democrats, while 92,000 are registered Republicans. The secretary of state's office had no estimate of turnout for this year's primary, but the number in recent midterm primaries has fluctuated. Turnout in the 2014 primaries was 44 percent, and in 2010, it was 49 percent. But in 2006, during a hotly contested primary for U.S. Senate, turnout was 58 percent. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET.",

She met with liberal activists eager to see universal health care and expanded rent-control laws. And she was cheered by hundreds of supporters at a downtown fundraiser, where she warned of those who scheme to turn liberal-minded Americans against each other. Virtually unknown just months ago, New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arrived in Los Angeles as a rising political star, about a month after her improbable upset of 10-term U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley in a New York City Democratic primary. On Thursday, she intentionally avoided politicians and Hollywood celebrities, instead choosing to share the stage at the low-dollar fundraiser with activists pushing for broader rent-control laws in California and a public-backed banking system in the city. In her speech, she warned of a broken economy in which luxury apartments stand vacant while homeless crowd the streets, and talked of a Democratic Party in which the working class and marginalized are ascendant. Bursts of applause followed her calls for universal health care and a cost-free education through college. She swiped repeatedly, if indirectly, at President Trump. \"It is not us who are crazy, not with that man in the White House,\" the former Bernie Sanders organizer said to cheers. Ocasio-Cortez was lauded by those who paid $27, or $10 for students, to see the candidate seen as the new face of the emerging democratic socialist movement. \"She really inspires me, because she's so young and she's getting so far,\" said Melainey Jane Foerster, 16, a high-school student from suburban Santa Clarita. Salesman Jon Pelzer, 65, said he's \"impressed by and energized by what she was able to do in New York.\" \"We share all the same values,\" added Pelzer, a Democrat who ran on a similar platform in California's 30th Congressional District but didn't advance to November. The surprise victory by the political novice in a district that includes parts of the Bronx and Queens came after a low-budget campaign that she built around liberal and social causes, not the traditional Democratic Party machine. Crowley had been expected to win easily. Her platform includes expanding the Medicare program to people of all ages and abolishing Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Her trip to California comes at a time when state and national Democrats have been contending with friction between their establishment and liberal wings. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein is being challenged in November by a fellow Democrat, state Sen. Kevin de Leon, who has positioned himself as a liberal alternative to the long-serving centrist. She warned of the influence of \"coastal elites\" in politics, and she recalled that her candidacy was largely dismissed. Ocasio-Cortez said she didn't receive an endorsement from any incumbent \"but we won anyway.\" She urged the crowd to \"engage in the fights that you know that are right.\"",

But according to a recording published by The Intercept, Hoyer told Tilleman that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) preferred another candidate \u2013 lawyer Jason Crow -- in the primary. \"Yeah, I'm for Crow,\" Hoyer told Tilleman, according to the website. \"I am for Crow because a judgment was made very early on. I didn't know Crow. I didn't participate in the decision. But a decision was made early on by the Colorado delegation.\" When Tilleman pushed back, Hoyer defended the party's decision to support what they believe is the more electable candidate in a primary. \"You keep saying I would like you to get out of the race, and of course that's correct,\" Hoyer told Tilleman.  Hoyer's office said that he is working to identify electable Democrats. \"Whip Hoyer is committed to taking back the House, and that involves working with local leaders to identify and support the strongest candidate for that district,\" Hoyer spokeswoman Katie Grant told CBS News.\u00a0 It is not unusual for party leaders to try and help candidates in primaries that they view as the most electable option.

However, the move did irritate Morgan Carroll, the state party chair. \"The DCCC verbally said they would be neutral and in practice just endorsed one of the candidates in CD6,\" Carroll wrote on Facebook.  Tilleman also criticized the DCCC, saying that their strategy was counterproductive.  \"They squash progressive candidates. They destroy the diversity of ideas in their caucus. They keep ideas like 'Medicare for All,' free community college, or impeaching Donald Trump from having a significant role in the national conversation,\" he told The Intercept. \"The issues that resonate most with voters are not the issues that the DCCC is telling candidates to focus on.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump announced the ouster of David Shulkin as secretary of Veterans Affairs this week, nominating longtime White House \u00a0physician Adm. Ronny Jackson as his replacement. Shulkin had come under withering criticism from lawmakers on Capitol Hill over his travel expenses and a blistering inspector general's report on conditions at the VA. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, is the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee and former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. He joined us to discuss the reforming the VA, Jackson's nomination and more. The following is a transcript of the interview with Sanders that aired Sunday, April 1, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders who sits on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. He joins us from Burlington in his home state this morning. Senator the VA is the largest health care system in this country. Will you support Dr. Ronnie Jackson as the nominee? SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Well we know nothing about what Dr. Jackson stands for and what his vision is for the VA. But Margaret this is what I will tell you. What concerns me very much is that right now in Washington we have a family called the Koch brothers, third wealthiest family in America a family that is prepared with a few of their other billionaire friends to spend four hundred million dollars on the coming elections. They are now the most powerful political force in America, stronger than the Democratic National Committee or the Republican National Committee. Their view has been we have got to privatize, \u00a0privatize and privatize. And what Dr. Shulkin, who Trump just fired this week has told us is that the reason for his firing is that he resisted privatization of the Veterans Administration. Now I work very closely with the major veterans organizations, the American Legion, VFW , DAV Vietnam vets all of the veterans organizations. And what they say is they want to strengthen the VA not dismember it, not privatize it it. So we will see what Dr. Jackson has to say. BRENNAN: Well the White House says at this time they have no intent to privatize the VA. Do you know what the Trump administration policy is? SANDERS: Yeah of course I do. They have been putting more and more money into the private sector with VA money. I do not believe them on that issue. I think they are listening to the Koch brothers and I think that that is a very, very bad idea. If you listen to veterans all across this country as I do they will tell you sure there are problems with the VA but by and large once they get into the system they are proud of the quality that the - quality care that the VA provides in fact the American Legion has just come out with a publication which vigorously opposes privatization. So I do believe that the Trump administration no matter what they are now saying I think they are working on behalf of the Koch brothers, look these are the guys, Koch brothers who want to privatize everything. You have a Trump administration that in their budget, the Trump budget proposed 500 billion dollar cuts in Medicare. Trillion dollar cuts in Medicaid. You have a Secretary of Education who doesn't believe in public education a head of the EPA. BRENNAN: Sir on the issue of the VA you did last year vote for a bill that allowed at least more leeway for veterans and their doctors - SANDERS: Right. BRENNAN: - to decide whether they wanted to opt in for private care. So it sounds like you are open to some private sector option here. SANDERS: Well there has always been private sector option if you live in a rural community you don't want 75, 80 year old veterans to travel two hours to get a physical examination. If there is a VA facility in the country that is not treating veterans in a timely manner of course you want to allow veterans to go to the private sector. That is the case now that has always been the case. But what the Koch brothers want and what I feared the Trump administration wants is to rip that wide open and to take many. We got a 200 billion dollar veterans budget. BRENNAN: Yeah. SANDERS: There are special corporate interests that want a big chunk of that money. We must not allow that to happen. BRENNAN: Senator we have to take a quick break and we'll talk to you on the other side of it. We'll be right back. SANDERS: Thank you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" I'm Margaret Brennan. We're back now with Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders who is going to be asking some tough questions of that next nominee to be the VA secretary, Senator. The VA says the average wait time at some facilities can be as long as 100 days. President says he's not happy with the speed of reform there. What is the source of this problem? SANDERS: Well look the VA is the largest integrated health care system in the country. And as I said previously if you asked the veterans organizations they by and large think the VA is providing good quality care. You know Margaret there is a lot of attention paid to the VA because it's a government agency. But I've got news for you. People all over this country when they want to get to a doctor or they need hospital care they don't get in the very next day. So I am sure that there are some VA facilities where the waiting time is too long. That has got to be addressed. There are other VA facilities for example I know here in Vermont that if you are dealing with a psychiatric crisis, an emotional crisis you get in that day that's pretty good. So the VA does a lot of good things. It has problems. We have got to improve the VA. But I think we've got to listen to the veterans of this country and not privatize it. BRENNAN: Senator you also sit on the Environment Committee and you've been a harsh critic of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. He's facing a number of questions about ethics and these new reports that he rented a residence here in Washington partly owned by the wife of a top energy lobbyist whose firm did business with the EPA. Do you think your committee should hold hearings on this? SANDERS: I do. But I think the issue goes well beyond that problem. The issue goes to the fact that the vast majority of people in this country understand that climate change is real. It is already doing devastating problems throughout our nation and throughout the world and yet we have a president and a head of the EPA who do not even recognize the reality of climate change let alone the need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. So you got a guy who's head of the EPA now who is nothing more than a front man for the fossil fuel industry and that is a very serious problem and the Congress has got to stand up and oppose that line of policy. BRENNAN: I imagine you oppose the lowering of emission standards that the administration is expected to announce this week. SANDERS: Well, of course. I mean what we have got to do is understand that we have over the last number of years made success against air pollution and against water pollution. We have made some success in transforming our energy system and the idea to go back and listen to the short term needs of the coal industry or the oil industry makes no sense to me at all. Look, here is the truth. What the scientific community is telling us is that climate change is one of the great environmental crises facing this planet and if we don't get a handle on that we're going to be leaving this planet - a planet to our kids, that is not healthy or habitable. We've got to address that. The Trump administration is moving in exactly the wrong direction. BRENNAN: Sir you have been critical of the Israeli government's decision to use lethal force against Palestinian demonstrators killing 15 wounding over 700. The Trump administration has stopped short of calling on Israel for restraint. Should they explicitly do so. SANDERS: Yes they should look, Gaza as I think everybody knows is a humanitarian disaster. The unemployment rate there is beyond comprehension. And there is just enormous unrest. What the function of the United States government should be right now is to sit down with the Israelis sit down with the Palestinians and figure out how, we can rebuild Gaza and also to tell the Israelis that when you've got tens and tens of thousands of people protesting, they cannot overreact and the idea of 15 or so people being killed and hundreds being wounded is - is to me unacceptable. BRENNAN: We should note the Palestinian Authority already did boycott a meeting at the White House recently to talk about rebuilding Gaza. Senator thank you so much for your time. We'll be right back with our political panel.",

            "article_content": "President Trump and Congress failed to reach an agreement on a spending plan by midnight Friday, triggering a partial shutdown of the federal government. Government shutdowns are unusual, but they're not unheard of.\u00a0 The government has partially shut down three times in the past quarter-century \u2014 and far more often in decades past. Shutdowns have led to furloughs of several hundred thousand federal employees, required many government activities to be stopped or curtailed, and affected wide swaths of the economy. During Jimmy Carter's administration, shutdowns happened nearly every year, averaging 11 days each. During Ronald Reagan's two terms in the 1980s, there were six shutdowns, typically just one or two days apiece. Legal opinions issued in 1980 and 1981 made shutdowns more impactful. Opinions by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti determined that failure to pass new spending bills required government functioning to shut down in whole or in part. Earlier \"shutdowns\" did not always entail an actual stop to government functioning and often were simply funding gaps will little real-world effect. Here's a look at recent shutdowns, their causes and impact: Sixteen-day partial shutdown, which came as tea party conservatives, cheered on by outside groups, demanded that language to block implementation of President Barack Obama's health care law be added to a must-do funding bill. Then-Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, tried to avoid a shutdown by funding the government piecemeal, but the effort faltered. The shutdown affected most government operations and resulted in the furlough of 850,000 employees, costing the government 6.6 million days of work and more than $2.5 billion in lost productivity, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. Boehner survived the shutdown but stepped down two years later amid conflict with the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. Republicans led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, intent on slashing the budget, forced a three-week shutdown in a bid to coerce President Bill Clinton to sign onto a balanced budget agreement. Republicans were saddled with the blame, but most Americans suffered relatively minor inconveniences such as closed parks and delays in processing passport applications. The fight bolstered Clinton's popularity and he sailed to re-election that November. Five-day shutdown after Clinton vetoed an interim spending bill to block Medicare premium increases. Led to longer shutdown a month later. The current shutdown came about as a result of a failure to reach a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, after Democrats demanded a fix to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and Republicans failed to gain even all the votes of their own party, as well as enough Democratic votes.\u00a0 The fiscal impact of the current shutdown is, as of yet, unclear. While some employees are considered \"essential\" and will continue to work, others are furloughed for now. Overnight, agencies issued guidance as to how to deal with the shutdown. Some agencies will continue to operate next week, no matter what happens. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Scott Pruitt said all employees should work as normal next week, as the agency has enough funding to last for a little while.\u00a0 On Saturday morning, the House and Senate returned to Capitol Hill to continue attempting to hammer out a deal.\u00a0 Mr. Trump began tweeting Saturday morning, blaming Democrats for the shutdown, which comes on the anniversary of his\u00a0inauguration.",
