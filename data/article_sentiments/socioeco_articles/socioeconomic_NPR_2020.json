            "article_content": "A poll of nonvoters shows there is little that would encourage them to vote \u2014 even campaigns haven't heavily invested in motivating this group.\n                \n                    \n                    Caroline Amenabar/NPR; Eric Ray/Flickr\n                    \n                \nhide caption A poll of nonvoters shows there is little that would encourage them to vote \u2014 even campaigns haven't heavily invested in motivating this group. More Americans voted in 2020 than in any other presidential election in 120 years. About 67% of eligible voters cast ballots this year, but that still means a third did not. That amounts to about 80 million people who stayed home. To better understand what motivates these nonvoters, NPR and the Medill School of Journalism commissioned Ipsos to conduct a survey of U.S. adults who didn't vote this year. The Medill school's graduate students did deep dives into various aspects of the survey here. Nonvoters' reasons for not voting include: They are disengaged, disaffected and don't believe politics can make a difference in their lives. They are also more likely to be Latino, younger, make less money and have lower levels of education than voters. A lack of engagement overall Difficulty voting doesn't appear to be a major reason why they don't vote. Three-quarters said they think it's at least somewhat easy to vote. It's more that these voters feel a sense of alienation and apathy. They are generally detached from the news and pessimistic about politics, the survey found. Politics is simply not the way to make change, they said. Two-thirds of nonvoters agree, for example, that voting has little to do with the way that real decisions are made in this country; they are 21 points more likely to say so than people who voted. A majority also said they believe it makes no difference who is elected president and that things will go on just as they did before. Nonvoters were 29 points more likely to say that than people who voted. (Read more about why they didn't vote, in their own words.) These 80 million Americans are also less engaged in their communities and have less confidence even in their local governments. They're also less likely to volunteer or to be civically engaged \u2014 doing things like sending letters to the news media and elected officials or participating in marches, protests and demonstrations. Nonvoters are also more likely than voters to say that traditional parties and politicians don't care about people like me; the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth; the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful; success in life is pretty much determined by forces outside our control; and to feel that most issues discussed in Washington don't affect them personally. Loading... They are also less likely to say that elections in this country are free and fair for all; to have a favorable opinion of the news media; to watch, read or listen to news every day; or to discuss politics with friends or family. If family and friends vote, that makes people more likely to vote, the survey found. Nonvoters also mostly shunned news of the presidential election. For example, only 38% said they followed stories about the presidential and congressional campaigns in 2020 at least fairly closely, compared with 79% of people who voted. And they were far less likely to have watched the debates or conventions. Less than a third watched the presidential debates, compared with almost two-thirds of voters. What's more, two-thirds of nonvoters said they didn't watch the presidential or vice presidential debates or either the Republican or Democratic conventions. Loading... Campaigns, which have sophisticated data programs showing which are the highest-propensity voters, don't seem to view this group as worth much effort. Less than a quarter of nonvoters said campaigns had reached out to them, offered information or asked them to vote. That's compared to almost half of voters. Not much, it seems, would motivate them to vote, either. Asked what they think would most encourage people to vote, the top answer was none or nothing (35%). That was followed by cleaning up government (27%), having more candidates to choose from (20%), being automatically registered to vote (16%) and making Election Day a national holiday (15%). Making Election Day a national holiday, incidentally, was the top answer for voters (42%), showing the disconnect between the groups. Who are nonvoters? There are strong socioeconomic correlations between voting and not voting. Nonvoters tend to make less money, have lower levels of education, be less likely to own their home or are less likely to be married. While only 21% of voters made $50,000 a year or less, 43% of nonvoters did. Just over a quarter of voters had a high school degree or less, but a majority (52%) of nonvoters did. Sixty percent of voters said they were married, but just 44% of voters did, which impacts economic power in a society when dual-income households are becoming increasingly necessary in more expensive parts of the country. Nonvoters were also more likely to be young and Latino. Thirty-five percent of nonvoters in this survey were between the ages of 18 and 34, compared with 24% of voters. And notably, a quarter of nonvoters were Hispanic, compared with just 7% of voters. Latinos tend to lean Democratic, and voter-registration efforts with Latinos in most presidential years are key for Democrats. That was hampered in this year of the coronavirus, and Democrat Joe Biden wound up underperforming in some heavily Latino areas such as South Texas and South Florida. Latinos are also more likely than other groups to say they are not interested in politics and most haven't voted in any other recent elections. The top reason Latinos give for why they don't vote is that they don't care much about politics, but another is that they have never been registered. Only 52% of Latinos surveyed overall said they were registered to vote. That compares to 80% of white respondents and 78% of Black Americans. But three-quarters of Latino nonvoters surveyed are not registered. Overall, 70% of nonvoters said they were not registered to vote. NPR and the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communication commissioned Ipsos to conduct a survey of U.S. adults who voted and did not vote in the 2020 presidential election. The survey of 1,843 adults included 1,103 nonvoters and 740 voters. The survey was conducted using Ipsos' online KnowledgePanel from Nov. 4-13. Overall, the survey has a +/-2.9 percentage point margin of error for all adults; for nonvoters, it is +/- 3.5 points; for voters, it is +/- 3.9 percentage point margin.

Kamala Harris stands with attendees and participates in the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. hymn at their Annual Pink Ice Gala in Columbia, South Carolina on Friday, Jan. 25, 2019. When Kamala Harris stepped to the podium in Delaware on Saturday night to speak to supporters as vice president-elect, she made all kinds of history: She'll become the first woman to serve as vice president. The first woman of African descent (on her father's side) and also the first Asian American (on her late mother's side). The first graduate of a historically Black college or university (Howard)\u2014and the first member of a Black sorority to sit a heartbeat away from the presidency. Black Greek organizations turned up and turned out to support Harris. They registered people to vote. They phone-banked. They encouraged, coaxed and nagged people to turn their ballots in. (You may have seen a popular Internet video: it features Black sorors dressed in their sororities' colors, accessorized in heels and pearls. Their T-shirts all said the same thing: Stroll To The Polls.) This 'Stroll to the Polls' video featuring four historically Black sororities grabbed national attention in mid-October. Kamala Harris' sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha (or AKAs, as they're known), is one of nine college-founded Black sororities and fraternities that comprise the Divine Nine. I spoke to Los Angeles author Lawrence C. Ross Jr., who himself is a Black Greek. He's Alpha Phi Alpha, the fraternity that proudly claims, among others, Martin Luther King Jr. and former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. The 20th anniversary edition of Ross' The Divine Nine: The History of African American Sororities and Fraternities, was released last year. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. the cover of The Divine Nine by Lawrence C. Ross, Jr.\n                \n                    \n                    Kensington Publishing\n                    \n                \nhide caption Can you put into context how long has this push for enfranchisement been going on amongst Black Greeks? Oh, pretty much since we actually began our organizations, Alpha Phi Alpha in particular. One of, if not our oldest, national programs has been A Voteless People is a Hopeless People, which began in the 1920s. So, you know, the idea of being enfranchised in terms of the vote really has been one of the drivers for all of our organizations. We look at ourselves as being responsible for empowering our community in all aspects, whether political aspects or education and the like. So what you have are a lot of initiatives. For example, most of the organizations [have these initiatives]. Delta Sigma Theta has Delta Days At The Nation's Capital, and Alpha Kappa Alpha has A.K.A. Day At The Capitol, and the like. They'll go to visit particular Congresspeople, they'll go to lobby. And so you combine that with the politicians that we have in our ranks, like members of the Congressional Black Caucus. And there has been a long tradition of activism, a long tradition of activism and recognizing that the power of the vote is what actually gives this community 13 percent of the population. It's its greatest power. A lot of people don't know that, traditionally, there's a difference between Black and white sororities, fraternities. Can you tell us about that difference? Sure. It's important to get a brief overview of how fraternities and sororities actually began. Before the Civil War, you had white fraternities formed mainly because [men] were just trying to create a space that was not as rigid as their college experience. You know, colleges pre-Civil War were about calculus, Latin, religion and the like. And the students just wanted a space to be able to be in literary societies where they'd be able to debate or just talk about the issues of the day, [like the] possibility of war \u2014 particularly getting close toward the end of the 19th century. [Then] you begin to see the development of sororities. They could do this later because women started to go to college in larger numbers? Right. Because before that, they never envisioned women on campus, particularly in a kind of a fraternal system. At the end of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, you begin to see minorities begin to create fraternities and sororities. So right around the time of the Spanish-American War, about 1898, you begin to see Latin fraternities \u2014 mostly white-presenting, like from Argentina, rather than Mexico or Central America. So you begin to see the development of those and you begin to see a lot of Asian ones. You really begin to see development of African American fraternities right around 1906, when Alpha Phi Alpha is formed. And a lot of this is tied basically to the idea that college moved from being the place of the elite where they would just go to be able to get a degree as part of the educated class, to a place where college was part of the social and economic movement in society. So [if you were Black] you could go to get a college degree and then get into the civil service or the postal service. You would qualify you to be a teacher or whatever, which would actually move you up and down the socioeconomic strata. So belonging to one of these Black Greek organizations wasn't mostly social, kind of like a dating service, then? It really meant something. And that really kind of informs how African American fraternities and sororities viewed fraternities. White fraternities and sororities love their fraternity brothers and their sorority sisters like everybody else. But that really ends in terms of their connection right at college graduation. I always joke that white fraternity and sorority members will say\" I was a member of X, Y, Z fraternity.\" Black fraternities and sororities never say \"was.\" They will say I \"am a member of the organization.\" Even when we're dead! We will say, \"He was a great dentist. He was a great father and he is a member.\" So it doesn't stop. So just as you're in a frat or a sorority for life, it sounds like you're also obligated to carry out the mission of that organization for life. Yes. The whole idea is connected to the idea of being race men and race women. The idea that you don't go to college for the more American, individualistic reason. Typically, Americans go to college because \"I go to college, I get my degree, I get a job. I have my family. Hey, I just live my life as an individual.\" Black people, and not just Black people in the Divine Nine, understand that they are not in college simply based upon their own individual characteristics. Andthey have a moral responsibility not just to get a degree for themselves, but to also enrich the community.They recognize the structure [of mainstream society] is intentionally created to denigrate them as second-class citizens. And what they're doing typically in the work of the fraternities and sororities is trying to deconstruct that. Kamala has been repping her black Greeks very hard! How indebted do you think the Biden-Harris ticket is for the support it got from Black Greeks and their work in voter mobilization this year? Look at it this way. I think, you know, Kamala is not the only Greek in the Biden organization. Really, fraternities and sororities are all through most Democratic and some Republican administrations. I think people are more conscious of it because Kamala is the first Black Greek to reach the position of vice president-elect. So that's good for her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha\u2014but maybe cause for a bit of envy from other Greek organizations? There's always a friendly rivalry between all of our organizations and people out on the outside typically take it way more seriously than we actually do. It is literally like your aunts and uncles all coming to Thanksgiving: They may talk about each other, but nobody else can talk about them, right? Right. Your people are your people. So with Kamala ... Oh yeah.We're like, \"OK, for this, we're putting all our hands in together. We're going to make this happen.\" And [all the Divine Nine] came together like a stroll-to-the polls type deal.",

The Republican congressional bills, part of the party's \"repeal and replace\" push in 2017, were eventually defeated. It was either put food on the table or drop their health insurance, says Oscar Anchia of Miami. His wife's coverage was costing $700 a month, and his hours had been cut back because of the coronavirus pandemic. So Anchia made the difficult decision to drop his spouse from his policy, because they needed the money. Then in October, his love for 40 years fell ill with COVID-19. \"This has been a crazy, crazy nightmare,\" he said, after his wife's first week in the hospital. He kept asking Baptist Health about the bill. He was already at $92,000 from her stay in the intensive care unit. At this point, Anchia's best hope is that his wife will be covered by a federal assistance program for uninsured COVID-19 patients. But that's because he lives in one of the dozen holdout states that hasn't expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. That part of the ACA was intended to provide health coverage for adults who are working but who have no insurance through their job \u2014 either because it's not offered or because they can't afford the premiums. Medicaid provides health care for millions of low-income Americans. But its future depends very much on politics. Over the past four years, the Trump administration has tried to impose conservative principles on the program and shrink it. A Joe Biden presidency would attempt to go the other way. \"For example, me, I always work. I've been working 36 years in the same company,\" says Anchia, who builds signage for airports. \"And now I find myself in this position. Medicaid would be great for regular people. I'm not the only one.\" Anchia's wife is out of the ICU, but he also expects he'll need help paying for prescription medication when she's sent home. In Florida alone, roughly 1.5 million people would be eligible for coverage under Medicaid expansion, according to estimates by the Florida Health Justice Project. It's a number that has grown recently because of the economic trouble and job losses triggered by the pandemic. \"The pandemic has really elevated the visibility of the suffering and that it cuts across socioeconomic lines,\" says Miriam Harmatz, executive director of the Florida Health Justice Project. \"These are folks you wouldn't have expected to be among the ranks of the uninsured.\" Under a Biden administration, Democrats could deliver on a proposal known as \"the public option.\" It would bring coverage to people in this uninsured group without requiring them to wait for state officials to take action on Medicaid. But Harmatz is hopeful that Florida could still join the ranks of expansion states, no matter who becomes president. Even under the Trump administration, some Republican-led states have moved forward with Medicaid expansion after initially refusing. New survey data from the Commonwealth Fund find that expansion remains popular with voters, even among Republicans, in 10 swing states that may decide the outcome of this election. This summer, voters in Oklahoma and Missouri approved ballot measures to expand Medicaid, against the wishes of their Republican governors and legislators. Most recently, Georgia's request to expand Medicaid was approved this month by Trump appointees at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Georgia's expansion, however, will apply to fewer adults than in other states, allow the state to charge some monthly premiums and require adults to work or engage in other \"qualifying activities.\" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp hailed the limited expansion of Medicaid as a way to save money. Critics point out, however, that the Kemp plan means Georgia actually receives less federal aid to cover these new Medicaid enrollees, compared with states that embraced a full Medicaid expansion, and that tens of thousands of Georgians will still remain uninsured, which can put financial stresses on hospitals and local taxpayers. In the last four years, Trump's health officials have pushed states to look for ways to spend less on Medicaid. \"I think the Trump administration views Medicaid the same way every Republican administration does, as sort of a nuisance,\" says Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Making work requirements part of eligibility has been the most popular way to try to rein in spending and push back against Medicaid expansion. But work requirements have been blocked by the courts. \"I don't really see a lot of enthusiasm for work requirements returning,\" Cannon says. \"But I don't really see a lot of enthusiasm by Republicans to work on any broader Medicaid reforms, either.\" The more sweeping Republican-backed initiative \u2014 which has been somewhat sidetracked by the pandemic \u2014 calls on states to overhaul how Medicaid is paid for. Currently, each state splits the costs of Medicaid with the federal government, with the feds paying 50% to 75% of each enrollee's cost, depending on the state. The new payment idea, called a \"block grant,\" would involve the federal government giving each state a yearly lump sum payment for Medicaid and would essentially cap the federal government's responsibility. Block grants have been an ambition of the Republican Party for decades. Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, paved the way for block grants in January. Tennessee was first in line. But the state is still the only one waiting to hear back on its request. That's partly because Tennessee is asking for a block grant that would bring the state more federal money for Medicaid, not less \u2014 as much as a billion dollars a year. \"Folks here in Tennessee found a creative way to propose a block grant that, at least from a financial standpoint, didn't pose really any risk for the state,\" says Mandy Pellegrin, policy director of the Tennessee-based Sycamore Institute. If the federal government approves the design of the proposed block grant, Tennessee could theoretically use the additional money to add more residents to its Medicaid rolls. \"Expansion is certainly something that could happen under this waiver,\" Pellegrin says. Even though Tennessee's specific proposal has the potential to cover many more people, Democrats have generally dismissed the idea of block grants as a backdoor way to cut benefits Americans are entitled to. This policy push-and-pull over Medicaid assumes that the Affordable Care Act will stay intact, including the 90% federal matching money that most states have relied on to expand coverage to the working poor. But the Trump administration is still pushing for the Supreme Court to overturn the entire law, with an oral argument set for Nov. 10. \"We would not expect that to continue under a Biden administration,\" says Rachel Nuzum, vice president of federal and state health policy at the Commonwealth Fund. \"So there's a fair bit of uncertainty. What we know is, states cannot operate well in an environment of uncertainty.\" Nuzum says this election \u2014 from state legislative contests up to the White House \u2014 has the potential to provide a little more certainty on how millions of Americans receive their health care.

AILSA CHANG, HOST: Medicaid provides health care for millions of low-income Americans, and its future depends very much on politics. Over the past four years, the Trump administration has tried to impose conservative principles on the program while shrinking it. A Biden presidency would attempt to expand the program. Blake Farmer of member station WPLN in Nashville explains how the presidential election could reshape Medicaid at a critical moment for health care. BLAKE FARMER, BYLINE: It was either put food on the table or drop their health insurance. Oscar Anchia of Miami says his wife's coverage was costing $700 a month, and his hours had been cut back from the pandemic. Then this month, she fell ill with COVID-19. OSCAR ANCHIA: This is the sixth day she's been in the hospital. It's about $92,000. FARMER: Anchia is hoping his wife will be covered by another federal program for the uninsured, but that's because he lives in one of the dozen holdout states that hasn't expanded Medicaid. Obamacare intended to provide coverage for people who are working but still need help through Medicaid. ANCHIA: For example, me, I always work - been working 36 years in the same company. And now I find myself in this position. And Medicaid will be a great help for, you know, regular people. I'm not the only one. FARMER: In Florida alone, roughly 1.5 million people would be eligible under expansion. Those estimates have grown amid the economic trouble caused by COVID, says Miriam Harmatz of the Florida Health Justice Project. MIRIAM HARMATZ: The pandemic, I think, has really elevated the visibility of the suffering and that it cuts across socioeconomic lines.

It would bring coverage to this group without having to wait for state action. Even under the Trump administration, some Republican-led states have moved forward with Medicaid expansion after some initial resistance. Most recently, Georgia opted in. But the libertarian Cato Institute's Michael Cannon says in the last four years, Trump's health officials pushed states to look at ways to spend less on Medicaid. Work requirements have been the most popular way to do that under Republican. MICHAEL CANNON: They wanted to find something to say about Medicaid or a way to push back against the Medicaid expansion. FARMER: But work requirements have been stopped by the courts. The other way the Trump administration has tried to limit Medicaid spending has also stalled out. The White House has offered to pay for Medicaid in a lump sum and let states figure out how to run it more efficiently. Tennessee is the only state that's pursuing this so-called block grant. But as Mandy Pellegrin, a policy analyst at the Sycamore Institute, points out, Tennessee is asking for a block grant that would bring in more money for Medicaid, not less. MANDY PELLEGRIN: Expansion is certainly something that could happen under this waiver. FARMER: Even though Tennessee's proposal has the potential to cover many more people, Democrats have generally dismissed the idea of block grants as a backdoor way to cut benefits Americans are entitled to. But the push and pull over Medicaid assumes the Affordable Care Act doesn't get struck down, including the generous federal matching money to cover the working poor.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., is hoping to retain her seat representing Minnesota's 5th Congressional District.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., is hoping to retain her seat representing Minnesota's 5th Congressional District. Five more states hold primaries Tuesday. Check out all the results in Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin, and here are five primaries to watch: 1. Minnesota's 5th Congressional District \u2014 Democratic: Even though Ilhan Omar has been in Congress for only a little more than a year-and-a-half, she's a household name to anyone who follows politics, thanks in no small part to President Trump, who has repeatedly denigrated Omar. \"Congresswoman Omar is an America-hating socialist,\" Trump blared at a campaign rally last fall in Minneapolis, the heart of the heavily Democratic 5th District. Omar entered Congress last year as a vocal member of the self-described \"squad.\" That's the group of four progressive women of color elected to Congress in 2018 who have been pressing for socioeconomic and environmental transformation. Omar says she thinks her Democratic constituents in Minnesota appreciate her using her national voice to push for change. \"It's been really the honor of my life to represent my district to be a voice for those that have been told they are too loud and that their, you know, presence isn't supposed to be in the halls of power,\" Omar said. But critics say Omar has demonstrated she's more interested in getting in front of microphones and engaging in Twitter wars than doing the work of the 5th District. Minnesota Democratic congressional candidate Antone Melton-Meaux speaks on Aug. 5 in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Minnesota Democratic congressional candidate Antone Melton-Meaux speaks on Aug. 5 in Minneapolis. One of Omar's four challengers, Antone Melton-Meaux, works as a mediator. He says Omar is too divisive and too focused on herself and that area Democrats have had enough. \"The residents feel deeply that Congresswoman Omar is out of touch with the district and has been focused on her own personal pursuits and celebrity to the detriment of the work that needs to be done for the 5th,\" Melton-Meaux said. Some voters were troubled by Omar's comments suggesting that American support for Israel was all about money and invoking what even many Democrats said were anti-Semitic tropes. Party leaders admonished Omar and she apologized early last year. Melton-Meaux has raised more than $4 million for his primary campaign. Omar has raised slightly more. The overwhelming majority of the money has come from outside Minnesota. Some Omar backers think many people supporting Melton-Meaux are simply trying to silence Omar by knocking her off the national political stage. Whoever wins the Democratic primary has a very good chance of prevailing in November as well. Democrats have held the seat for more than a half century. Loading... 2. Georgia's 9th Congressional District \u2014 Republican: GOP Rep. Doug Collins is running for U.S. Senate, and as in the 14th District next door, there is a contentious two-candidate runoff for the open seat. Both districts are solidly Republican. State Rep. Matt Gurtler won the most primary votes in June but has been widely rejected by what he calls the state party \"establishment.\" He has angered colleagues in the General Assembly over the years by voting no on any bill that expands state government. He's dubbed himself \"the most hated man in Georgia by the Republican establishment because I don't go along with what they want me to go along with.\" Gurtler sees himself as someone who will take on congressional Democrats and \"RINO Republicans,\" with RINO meaning \"Republican In Name Only.\" His opponent, Andrew Clyde, is the chosen candidate of many Georgia officials. The Navy veteran with no elected experience owns a gun store in Athens, Ga. University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock said the state's more conventional GOP officeholders realize that if Gurtler is elected, \"they're not going to see much in the way of federal money coming into their local communities. ... I think maybe Gurtler might well say he doesn't want federal funds.\" Loading... 3. Georgia's 14th Congressional District \u2014 Republican: This primary runoff to replace retiring Republican Rep. Tom Graves features a similar dynamic to the 9th: The state's incumbent officials hope to keep one candidate out of office. In this district, it's Marjorie Taylor Greene. The construction executive won 40% of the votes in the June primary and has caught national headlines since. She has repeated the QAnon conspiracy theory, but it was offensive video statements about Muslims, African Americans and Jewish Democratic donor George Soros, unearthed by Politico, that quickly isolated her from members of the Republican caucus. The top three House GOP leaders denounced Greene's comments, and conservative Georgia Rep. Jody Hice rescinded his endorsement after the videos surfaced. Many of the state's elected officials have instead thrown their support behind her opponent, neurosurgeon and political newcomer John Cowan, whose slogan says \"all of the conservative, none of the embarrassment.\" According to Eric Sands, political science professor at Berry College, the candidates represent \"two different kinds of Republicans\" in the 14th. And mainstream Republicans, he said, are \"terrified of what [Greene] might end up saying if she became a member of the House of Representatives that would then end up reflecting badly on the party.\" Loading... 4. Wisconsin's 5th Congressional District \u2014 Republican: This is another open seat, left vacant by the retiring Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner. Sensenbrenner has represented Milwaukee's suburbs since 1979, and as The New York Times reported when he announced his retirement, \"few departing lawmakers have been as central to the party's identity in the House as long as Mr. Sensenbrenner.\" Two Republicans are vying to take his place. Sensenbrenner has endorsed Scott Fitzgerald, an Army Reserve veteran and 25-year member of the state Senate and current majority leader. Fitzgerald's opponent is Cliff DeTemple, a longtime military reservist and small business owner. Fitzgerald has easily outraised and outspent DeTemple this campaign. The winner of the GOP primary will face Democrat Tom Palzewicz in November. The district is considered solidly Republican by handicappers. Loading... 5. Connecticut presidential primaries: Don't forget about Connecticut! Though there's no drama about the outcome, the last presidential primaries, just days ahead of the parties' respective nominating conventions, will be held in Connecticut, which postponed its April contests because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Updated at 6 a.m. ET Saturday In Belarus, a 37-year-old political novice is giving Europe's longest-serving leader a run for his money. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya is challenging Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, 65, in an unexpectedly contentious election set for Aug. 9. An English translator and mother of two, Tikhanovskaya decided to run after her husband, a popular blogger, was jailed in May. \"I don't need power, but my husband is behind bars,\" Tikhanovskaya told a giant campaign rally in the capital Minsk on Thursday. \"I've had to hide my children. I'm tired of putting up with it. I'm tired of being silent. I'm tired of being afraid.\" A huge crowd of supporters filled a city park, waving the flashlights on their cellphones as darkness fell. Tikhanovskaya has been attracting crowds in towns across Belarus ever since she united with the campaigns of two other opposition candidates, one of whom is in pre-trial detention, the other who has fled to Russia for his safety. Tikhanovskaya's main campaign promise is to hold new, free and fair elections with the participation of all opposition candidates. Her campaign slogan is the same as the name of her husband's blog, \"a country to live in,\" and she calls on Belarusians to demand quality health care and education, democratic elections and a foreign policy that seeks friends, not enemies, around the world. Belarus \u2014 sandwiched between Russia and NATO members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia \u2014 has existed in a vacuum since the fall of the Soviet Union three decades ago.  Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, has survived on energy subsidies from the Kremlin, even while staving off Russian President Vladimir Putin's overtures for closer political and economic integration. Tikhanovskaya became Lukashenko's chief opponent after her husband Sergei was denied registration as a candidate and jailed on charges of violating public order and election laws. Sergei Tikhanovsky had gained popularity with his YouTube channel that took on socioeconomic issues ignored by state television. Amnesty International considers Tikhanovsky a \"prisoner of conscience\" and has condemned \"a growing clampdown on human rights\" in advance of the August vote. Candidates, their supporters and political activists have all faced detention during the election campaign. \"We are deeply concerned about the reports of mass protests and detentions of peaceful activists and journalists,\" U.S. State Department Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a tweet posted by the U.S. Embassy in Minsk this month. \"We think it is incredibly important for the government to provide a level playing field for everyone who wants to take part in the elections.\" The United States has been without an ambassador to Minsk since 2008, when bilateral relations broke down amid a crackdown on the Belarusian opposition. Now Lukashenko is pursuing rapprochement with Washington as a way of countering pressure from the Kremlin. In February, he received Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Minsk, and President Trump has since nominated a new U.S. ambassador. Lukashenko, known for his folksy witticisms, alternately lambastes or praises the West, depending on the occasion. During a visit to a Belarusian special forces unit last week, he compared recent events in the United States with those in Belarus. \"We would not want to resort to using the armed forces, however, anything can happen. The United States is a case in point,\" he said, referring to the deployment of U.S. federal agents amid continuing protests in some U.S. cities. Lukashenko said modern wars begin with street protests: \"If there are not enough people here to take part in such revolutions, they will bring them from abroad. These are professional military gangsters who are specially trained, mostly as part of private military companies.\" Five days later, the Belarusian KGB reported to Lukashenko that 33 men working for a Russian private military contractor had been arrested in Minsk. The KGB said the men were part of a team planning to foment unrest before the election, and that more than 150 others were still at large. On Thursday, Belarusian investigators opened a criminal case against the Russians \u2014 and linked them to Tikhanovskaya's husband.   She dismissed the allegations as \"completely implausible\" Putin's spokesman has said the reports out of Belarus are full of \"insinuations\" and \"speculation,\" and voiced the hope that the arrested Russians would be freed from their \"groundless detention.\" He denied that private military contractors exist in Russia. \"We need to remember that it's a long-standing tradition of Lukashenko's to use terrorists as bogeymen,\" wrote Andrei Sinitsyn, opinion editor of the Russian online journal Republic.ru. \"After the elections, which Lukashenko won, these stories fizzled out, although opposition politicians were jailed anyway.\" The Kremlin is interested in negotiating with a weakened Lukashenko, Sinitsyn said, but his removal as a result of a democratic election \u2014 or a revolution \u2014 would set a \"terrible precedent\" for Russia. Belarusian opposition figures are afraid that the hunt for Russian mercenaries could be used as a pretext for more draconian measures by the authorities.  But that fear didn't stop Tikhanovskaya's supporters from turning out en masse in Minsk. \"They talk about some kind of revolution,\" Tikhanovskaya said. \"What revolution? Why provoke your own people? We have absolutely no need for fighters, we are peaceful people.\"",

What if a blackout were to happen in a major city in one of America's swing states on Election Day 2020? Or if an error occurred while tabulating electronic ballots? How would the electorate respond if one of the candidates refused to concede the election? These are all scenarios that law professor and Election Law Blog founder Richard Hasen considered while writing his new book, Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust and the Threat to American Democracy. \"One reaction to calling the book Election Meltdown is that it's a little alarmist, but I'm going to own that and say, yes, I'm sounding the alarm \u2014 even if there's a small risk of this happening,\" Hasen says. Hasen adds that tight races are at most risk of interference: \"There's something called the election administrator's prayer: 'Lord, let this election not be close,' because when it gets close, you start looking at all of the problems that can occur,\" he says. But 2020 may be shaping up to be a close election, and Hasen warns: \"It's now 20 years after Bush v. Gore, and we haven't learned our lesson. An election meltdown is a real possibility \u2014 even if it's a small one.\" On possible scenarios where one side won't concede after the results in November Dirty Tricks, Distrust, and the Threat to American Democracy by Richard L. Hasen Hardcover, 187 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Lots of people think about the idea of Donald Trump not leaving office and having to be pulled out by the military. I think that that's just one of a number of ways in which we could have a problem. You can imagine another scenario in which Trump narrowly wins in a state like Florida, but there's a widespread belief among Democrats that he wins our election because the Florida legislature blocked implementation of a law that was passed by voters a few years ago that was meant to reenfranchise felons. So you can imagine the losers on the Democratic side being the ones who are not willing to give in. Or another scenario, as you can imagine, that there's some kind of external shock to our system: It could be some kind of terrorist attack or some kind of cyberattack that disrupts voting, and it could affect the outcome of an election, a state. We don't have good procedures for figuring out what to do when that happens and that could lead to one or the other side feeling that the election was not conducted fairly. There's lots of ways that things could go south. On external and internal threats to our election There's the issue of perception and the issue of reality. There are certain kinds of external things that could be done to try to manipulate public opinion, as we saw the Russians do in the 2016 election when it came to social media as well as the leaking of materials. What's going to happen if Joe Biden is the nominee and all of a sudden Burisma documents start appearing? Some of those documents, as we know from a recent French election, that might be leaked could include false documents. So these are the kind of external threats that could cause people to believe that the election was not conducted fairly. There could be machine breakdowns. There's the transition to new voting rules and new voting machines that could cause some problems at the polling places, that could cause some disputes about how to deal with a recount. And then there's all of this talk about voter fraud and voter suppression there. This is going to be the first election since the 1980s where the Republican National Committee is not going to be subject to a court order, a consent decree which barred the party from engaging in certain so-called ballot security measures at polling places. This means that in this election, President Trump, as he tried to do in the 2016 election, could organize people to engage in so-called poll-watching activities in Democratic and minority areas. What we saw in the 1980s before the consent decree were off-duty police officers in uniform patrolling polling places. On President Trump standing in the way of preventing election interference A nightmare scenario involves a hack by the Russians of the power grid in a Democratic city, like Detroit or Milwaukee, in a swing state, which could happen on Election Day and could affect the vote in that state, which could affect the national vote totals. This should be considered an act of war, and we would want a president out there who is actively warning the Russians and others \u2014 the Iranians and anyone else that might try to interfere in our elections \u2014 that it is completely unacceptable and that American elections are for Americans to decide. Not only do we not have that leadership from the president, we have the president actively undermining that message. And so while I think there are many good people in the federal government who are working on issues of election cybersecurity and working on other issues, the leadership from the top is really problematic. On what the contingency plan is if there's a cyberattack or a terrorist attack on Election Day I asked the Secretary of State of Michigan Jocelyn Benson about this, this nightmare scenario. And, she said, polling places have paper ballots, provisional ballots that could be used in the event of an emergency. If there's a citywide blackout, that means that lots of people are not getting to the polling place. So even if everyone who got to the polling place got a provisional ballot, how many people, if the buses and trains are not running and the lights are out, how many people are not going to vote? It would just be something that certainly would affect the kind of turnout you'd see in a city on Election Day. ... What we don't have are good rules for dealing with either a terrorist attack or a natural disaster that could affect an election outcome in a presidential election. Richard Hasen What we don't have are good rules for dealing with either a terrorist attack or a natural disaster that could affect an election outcome in a presidential election. It's much easier to rerun an election or take some other kind of remedial measure when you're talking about a local election. On concerns about voting machines themselves [Pennsylvania is] rolling out new voting machines. There's a whole new set of voting technology that's out there now. Some of the new technology uses bar codes to print out on a piece of paper the choices of the candidate. And there's all kinds of disputes now among computer scientists, election integrity advocates and others over whether these new so-called BMD [ballot marking device] machines are secure enough for counting. One issue is, if you have a bar code on there or some QR code, it's not something the human being can read. It's just a series of lines, and you don't know who that vote is for. The candidate choices are also going to be printed on that ballot, but one question is going to be, are people going to check to make sure that those ballots printed the names correctly? And in the event of a recount, what would control the bar code or the names on the ballot? Given how much suspicion there is now about hacking and about the lack of safeguards across all of technology, I think a lot of people are worried that if we're going to rely on bar codes that are going to be counted by machines, that are produced by companies that are for the most part private for-profit companies, that there's not enough security in that kind of system when it comes to counting votes. That's why many people have called for a hand-marked paper ballots ... that is the best format for voting, because then you can look and see whether someone bubbled in that circle for Trump or for his Democratic opponent. On his biggest concerns for the next 10 months before the 2020 presidential election No. 1, the media needs to have an important role in educating people about the vote counting, in not calling elections early, not calling them prematurely until they're convinced that enough votes have been counted, in educating voters about how long the process takes. The American public is going to be really sick and tired of the 2020 election by the time we get to November, and they're going to want an instant result. And yet the people need to be prepared that it's going to take a week or two. So that's, I think, at the top of the list for the news media. At the top of the list for state and local officials, it's finding those weak links, it's having contingency plans that are in place to make sure that the election is going to be smoothly run, especially in swing states, especially if there are internal, external forces that try to disrupt the election. And having plans for post-Election Day for giving out clear, transparent information about how the vote-counting process is going to take place. ... Third, behind the scenes, there needs to be a tremendous amount of cybersecurity work to make sure that we don't have the kinds of disruptive hacks of our infrastructure or of our voting technology that could affect the outcome of the election or \u2014 just as important \u2014 cause people to think that the election outcome has been manipulated even if it hasn't. On the long-term changes to our election system he would like to see I think I would move to national elections. If you look at the way advanced democracies [hold elections] (think, Australia, U.K., Canada) ... they all have national voting systems where civil servants who are not partisans are running the election. The voting machinery is the same. If you go anywhere in the country, things are much more streamlined and they're simpler. I would do that. I would also have universal voter registration. So every voter, when [they turn] 18, gets registered to vote and gets a unique voter registration number that stays with [them] for [their] entire life. I think that kind of system and I'd have a national voter ID card where people could use their thumbprint if they prefer, rather than their ID in order to vote.

A yellow school bus with snow on the roof chugs up to the front door of Bucksport High School in Maine, where Principal Josh Tripp greets the handful of late-arriving students as they drag themselves inside. Tripp is just glad they've shown up in a year when school is half online, sports and clubs have been curtailed, and the world can seem as cold and gray as a winter morning in this sparsely populated coastal town. \"Their overall feeling toward education right now is that they've just been beaten down,\" Tripp says. \"Everything about this year has been harder. Certainly being an election year and seeing so much negativity around forecasts of our future, regardless of what political side you're on \u2014 there's just a lot of dim and dreary outlooks.\" In rural communities like this one, the isolation and uncertainty of the pandemic year are translating into more than teenage angst. Their overall feeling toward education right now is that they've just been beaten down. Josh Tripp, principal at Bucksport High School in Maine Big drops in enrollment It's driving a dramatic drop in the proportion of students going on to college, threatening the already precarious economies of rural areas and widening their socioeconomic drift from urban and suburban America. The number of rural students filling out the federal application for financial aid, a sign of whether they're even considering going to college, has plummeted by more than 18%, the National College Attainment Network reports. That's worse than the also alarming nearly 16% drop among urban students. The numbers are down even more in largely rural states including West Virginia (32%), Louisiana (30%), Mississippi (26%), Alaska (24%) and Arkansas and Oklahoma (23%). Many universities and colleges in rural places already have seen big drops in enrollment this year. In Idaho, for instance, which already has the lowest proportion in the country of high school graduates who go on to college (tied with Alaska at 44%), first-time undergraduate enrollment fell nearly 4% at the University of Idaho, nearly 8% at Idaho State University and more than 5% at Boise State University \u2014 with an even bigger slide among first-time in-state undergrads. Those figures include huge declines among dual-enrollment students, who get a head start by taking college classes while they're still in high school, suggesting that future numbers may be even worse. \"One of my greatest fears is that they won't come back,\" Kevin Boys, president of Southern State Community College, says of the many students who have opted to forgo college in his service area of rural southwestern Ohio. Enrollment at Southern State dropped 16% this semester, a spokeswoman said.

Maine is the nation's most rural state, with more than 60% of its population considered rural. Until this year, there were indications that rural college-going was increasing. The proportion of rural students going to college rose from 51% in 2011 to 61% in 2016, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, though it has stalled since then. That's the same proportion as urban students, if still fewer than the 67% of suburban high school graduates who go to college. Now there's worry that this progress may reverse, in large part because of COVID-19. By far the biggest single barrier to college among students in rural schools is the price, according to a survey released in September by researchers at universities in Maine, Oregon, Georgia and Alaska. Average household earnings in rural areas are nearly 20% lower than incomes elsewhere, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says. This has also gotten worse as a result of the pandemic, which has shuttered businesses and cost jobs in rural communities already suffering from declines in agriculture and industry. In Bucksport, the paper mill that was the town's biggest employer closed abruptly just before Christmas in 2014, taking more than 500 jobs with it. Today, what's left of the idle mill and its lone remaining smokestack loom over one end of Main Street, waiting to be redeveloped into a promised salmon farm. \"When you could go make $45,000 a year right out of high school working at the mill, there wasn't that push to say you need to go spend $100,000 on a college education to do the same exact thing,\" says Tripp, wearing a facemask imprinted with the high school's Golden Bucks logo.

And those towns really haven't rebounded.\" Thirty-seven percent of the students at Bucksport High School come from families with incomes low enough to qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, state figures show. \"So a number of our students don't even feel like [college] is an option for them,\" Tripp says. Meanwhile, the prospect of having to pay for college, only to remain online, has fueled resistance among students who dislike the experience of remote education. Even with prospects that a vaccine will allow colleges to return to being fully in person, Ethan Lozier, a Bucksport High School senior, hears his classmates asking, \"Why do I want to go and have online classes like this and spend thousands of dollars?\" Lozier says he's been wondering the same thing, although he plans to go to college next year. Some rural students have stopped even coming to school. In Maine, more than 4%, or nearly 8,000, have disappeared this year from the public schools, state figures show. Katy Hunter, a science teacher and college adviser at Bucksport High, grew close last year to a student with whom she ate lunch every day. Now the student isn't showing up at all. \"You feel helpless,\" Hunter says. \"You know that this person is very capable, and a good person. I don't think they realize what this is going to do to their futures.\" Sixty miles away, in the northern Maine community of Dover-Foxcroft, Amber Richard says of her classmates: \"Their drive is just gone. The quarantine kind of just drained them and now they're, like, 'Well, I don't really want to now just go be in [college].' ... They just want a break.\" Dover-Foxcroft spans the Piscataquis River, which once powered sawmills, tanneries, woolen companies, a piano factory and furniture-makers; it's the seat of Piscataquis County, Maine's poorest and least populated county, which is three times the size of Rhode Island but has fewer than 18,000 people in it, or under five inhabitants per square mile.

The team is still scheduled to play, but with strict limits on the number of people who can watch. \"Friday nights here, not only do you have athletes on this floor, you've got full stands\" of fans, says Kandi Martin, a college counselor at the school, gesturing around the empty gym, which is hung with championship banners commemorating 11 state titles in the past 12 years. It's another example of how the isolation in rural America has been worsened by COVID-19, making it hard for teachers to keep their students motivated, Martin says. \"Living in Maine is tough,\" Martin says. \"Living through a Maine winter is even more difficult. Living through a Maine winter with COVID is crazy.\" Even before now, rural students have doubted their prospects. Though 81% in that survey said they want a college degree, only 65% said they expected they would actually get one. Twenty percent said they weren't smart enough, 12% didn't want to move away for college and 17% said they had to go to work immediately after high school. Sami Bitat intends to go to college when he graduates from Foxcroft Academy in the spring. But he cites one of his friends when describing the way many of his classmates feel about it: \"None of his family went to college, and they're doing fine. So his idea is, like, 'Well, they didn't go to college and they're doing fine. I don't see why I have to go to college.' \" Meanwhile, the pandemic has put a stop to the usual class assemblies, meetings with college counselors and recruiters, and raffles to encourage completing the financial aid forms. \"This year there's a lot less exposure to\" the idea of college, Bucksport High School senior Addie Morrison says. \"So there's a lot less interest.\" Bucksport High science teacher Katy Hunter stops to consider what life awaits some of her students who opt not to continue their educations. \"I don't know,\" she says. \"I mean, McDonald's? I haven't really thought about that. I don't really want to know what the end result is going to be. Because it can't be good.\" This story about rural students was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in collaboration with Maine Public Radio.

Douma, on the outskirts of Damascus, was targeted by an air strike carried out by Syrian government forces. Nine years ago this month, residents of the small Syrian town of Douma were in full rebellion against the regime of President Bashar Assad. Throughout the preceding year, Assad had watched as popular protests ousted dictators in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, and demonstrations spread to Bahrain, Algeria, Yemen. Now pro-democracy dissent had ignited across his country \u2014 including in Douma, just five miles from the capital Damascus. The regime stationed checkpoints on Douma's access roads. Syrian military patrolled the town. As a reporter covering the Arab Spring, I watched as men clustered one Friday at the doorway of a mosque in Douma, gathering their courage. Every few seconds, three or four of them ran across the avenue, shouting \"Freedom!\" or \"Down, down, down with the regime!\" as bullets cracked around them. They dived down a side alley where a crowd was cheering them, just out of range of the regime snipers positioned on Douma's rooftops. Some residents left the doors of their homes ajar, offering protesters shelter. Others whispered warnings to each other about \"dogs\" \u2014 a reference to the military. The activists who brought me to Douma \u2014 three university graduates in their 20s \u2014 secretly filmed the town's protests for broadcast by Al Jazeera and other foreign television networks. They worked in a safe house, sleeping on foam mattresses in a single room with one tiny window. Like everyone I met participating in Douma's rebellion, they knew their work could get them detained, tortured or disappeared. The risks were worth it, they believed, because this was the start of a better future. That future did not materialize. In Douma and elsewhere in Syria, the regime fought back with unbridled brutality. Loyalists beat and raped protesters. Soldiers and police shot them dead. In some hospitals, patients suspected of opposing the government were tortured. The military shelled entire towns. The uprising turned into a civil war that continues to this day. \"This is a massacre,\" Yahya, an activist who'd brought me to Douma, emailed me in July 2012, as tank fire bombarded the town. \"I'm barely surviving.\" Yahya and I decided he should only ever give me his first name so that if the Syrian regime ever detained me, I wouldn't be able to reveal his identity. That October, he told me seven members of his family had been killed in a single airstrike. It was the last time I heard from him. Another Douma resident told me years later he believed Yahya had been arrested and died in a government prison.

The Arab Spring began that month in Tunisia, following the self-immolation of a Sidi Bouzid street vendor. Riots and demonstrations followed against unemployment and poor living conditions. The war in Syria, which has now claimed some 500,000 lives and displaced millions, represents the worst of how the Arab Spring unfolded. Across the region, the hopes from that time have been mostly dashed. Yemen and Libya are in the grips of civil war. Egypt, after a brief period under an elected president, is once again ruled by a strongman in charge of a regime perhaps even more autocratic than that of Hosni Mubarak, the longtime dictator ousted in 2011. Of the various revolutions that took place, only in Tunisia \u2014 where the Arab Spring began with a street vendor's self-immolation in December 2010 \u2014 has democracy endured. But the Arab Spring did bring some changes, and across the region, people are trying to keep its ideals alive.

Mada Masr has continued publishing even though its offices have been raided and its website temporarily blocked. This year, Attalah says she was briefly jailed for reporting on the spread of COVID-19 in Egyptian prisons. In Egypt, journalist Lina Attalah cofounded a new, independent newspaper in 2013, as the country's military ousted the democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi. The paper, Mada Masr, \"was basically born at a time when we could tell that there would be such a retreat in civil and political rights, and be deterioration in socioeconomic conditions,\" Attalah says. \"There wouldn't be also any independent voices creating a record out of this crisis, but also trying to engage with it and trying to think through ways out.\" Mada Masr has continued publishing even though its offices have been raided and its website temporarily blocked. Attalah and her team have been arrested for running stories related to President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and his family. This year, Attalah says she was briefly jailed for reporting on the spread of COVID-19 in Egyptian prisons. Time named her among the world's 100 most influential people this year for her commitment to independent journalism despite the dangers. \"We're not very obsessed with surviving, in the sense that if we have to do a story that would cost us our life as a newspaper, the choice would be to do it, actually,\" she says. \"We know very well the chances are this could be over any time.\" She says public support gives her and her team some protection: they have been released from jail, she says, because of the massive outcry their arrests have caused. And she believes that kind of public response is a consequence of the Arab Spring. She believes the Sissi regime is repressive because it's fragile. And it's fragile, she says, because the Arab Spring taught people from all social classes that they have a right to be political, to organize for independent journalism and human rights. \"This was a radical change in the way people think about the authorities, the state, and about their rights,\" she says. \"There is this power-building, you know, that happens incrementally, step by step together with people.\" Part of that power has found expression through the arts. In Libya, I met Islam Medani when he was a teenager in 2011. He and some friends in his hometown of Misrata formed a band named FB-17 \u2014 a nod to February 17, the day in 2011 that clashes began in Benghazi between protesters and security forces from the regime of Moammar Gadhafi. The band rapped songs about Libya's revolution. \"No More Lies,\" with lyrics like \"we need to be free, that's what we need to be,\" and other songs became instant hits in rebel-held parts of Libya, blasting from boomboxes on the front lines to raise the spirits of opposition militias. Medani, now 27 and a music producer, says he's been dragged into Libya's cycle of wars and ceasefires. The revolution that ousted Gadhafi in 2011 resulted in a cycle of tribal and factional infighting, and a civil war that has essentially divided the country. When ISIS captured the nearby city of Sirte in 2015, Medani joined the militia that went to fight them. A soldier stands near anti-Gadhafi graffiti in Libya in 2011.

But if I didn't go to the fight, the fight would come to our families,\" he says. Then he fought forces belonging to Libyan general Khalifa Haftar. He has lost many friends to these wars. But he says he can't bring himself to regret the revolution \u2014 because it has also brought some freedoms. Under Gadhafi's regime, Libya was notoriously closed off. \"The government was always chasing anyone who tried to reach the Internet or YouTube,\" says Medani. \"We were living in a black box.\" Now, at least, he says, Libyans are connected to the wider world. They know there are different and better ways to live. These days, Medani gets together with friends to sing songs about their hopes for Libya's future. Music can help people \"make a revolution in themselves,\" he says. \"And after that, maybe they can make a revolution in the country.\" This growing awareness is part of a continuum of change, an ongoing process that started in 2011, analysts say. \"It is completely unrealistic to expect political systems that are entrenched, that have been in place for decades and that are highly autocratic, to overnight change into democratic systems,\" says Lina Khatib, who leads the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House in London. She believes it will take a generation for Arab Spring countries to see fuller change: \"I think we should reserve judgment and wait,\" she says. \"The youth of today will be the leaders of the Arab world and then it will be a very different landscape.\" In Egypt and across the region, she says she sees \"young people who are not as scared as their parents are of change.\" The young generation, she says, \"perhaps because the world is globalized, can see that there is an alternative out there, that they don't have to settle for the systems that they have grown up with.\" One sign of this, Khatib believes, is a spate of recent victories by independent candidates in student elections in Beirut. University elections are often seen as a bellwether for national politics in Lebanon, which has been governed by entrenched sectarian leaders since the end of the civil war in the 1990s. Last year, Lebanon experienced massive popular protests against poor public services and state corruption. Some referred to the protests as Lebanon's own Arab Spring. The protests forced the resignation of the country's prime minister, but did little to bring real political change. So now, Lebanon's youth are trying a different way. Leen al-Harake helped bring about a sweeping victory for independent candidates in October elections at the Lebanese American University, where she studies architecture. She has spent much of the last year protesting the incompetence and corruption of the Lebanese government. She was 12 years old during the Arab Spring, but says that time was instructive: \"The movements that were happening then were teaching us a lot about what we could do and how we could stand up [to] governments, how we could stand up for people and power.\" Being involved in student politics and organizing independent political parties is a sign of how popular opposition to power is evolving into \"practical, logical\" tactics, she says. She hopes those tactics will someday bring about lasting political change in her country \u2014 and in the region. Nada Homsi contributed to this story from Beirut.",

            "article_content": "As part of NPR's election-year project, Where Voters Are, All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro sits down with the mayor of Pueblo, Colo.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: This past week, NPR launched a new project called Where Voters Are where we travel across the country to speak to voters about the issues that are shaping their choices this election year. Next week, we will be headed to Southern Washington State to hear from voters there. And just a few days ago, my ALL THINGS CONSIDERED co-host Ari Shapiro kicked off our series in Pueblo, Colo. Today, Ari brings us his conversation with one of the city's leaders. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Pueblo, Colo., was built on waves of immigration over more than a century. Today, the city is 50% Hispanic. There are Italian markets that have been in the same family for five generations, Slovenian bars that still pour ice-cold shots of slivo - plum brandy, slivovitz - that'll make your head spin. Pueblo Mayor Nick Gradisar traces his family back to Slovenia. He's a Democrat, 70 years old. And like most of the other immigrants who came to this town, his ancestors were drawn here by the steel mill, whose smokestacks still define Pueblo's silhouette. NICK GRADISAR: People came to Pueblo from all over the world to build this steel - to make the steel that built the American West. So those people - at one time at the mill, there were 40 different languages that were spoken at the mill, 24 foreign-language newspapers in Pueblo. So Pueblo has that kind of proud history. And all those people who came from all over the world built our neighborhoods, our churches - those kind of things. And while Pueblo was changed, those neighborhoods and those identities still remain. SHAPIRO: Even the mayor himself spent summers in college working at the steel mill. Today, a quarter of the people in Pueblo are below the poverty line. As I sat in Pueblo City Hall talking with Mayor Gradisar, I was distracted by a piece of artwork hanging behind him. And finally, I had to ask him about it. There's an incredible photograph behind you that I've just been looking at as we do this interview. And it shows somebody in a steel mill with a red-hot band of metal coming out, and he's grabbing it with metal tongs. Do you know what year this was taken? GRADISAR: You know, that's my dad. SHAPIRO: That's your father. GRADISAR: Yeah, that's my dad. So that photo was taken, I think - no, not - he was 38 years old when that was taken... SHAPIRO: Wow. GRADISAR: ...So that's... SHAPIRO: Younger than you are now. GRADISAR: Oh, yeah - way younger than I am now. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). GRADISAR: But yeah, he was a catcher. That was - that work was called a catcher. And what happens is it's a rolling mill, a 10-inch rolling mill, so that that rod comes out of one end, and you put it back in the rollers and send it back the other way. And it reduces it - the diameter - every time it goes through. We've had that black-and-white photograph in our family for a long time. SHAPIRO: On the description next to the photograph, it says he was the son of Slovenian immigrants and didn't learn English until he started grade school. GRADISAR: Right. Yeah. SHAPIRO: So this is your family history and the city history. GRADISAR: Right. SHAPIRO: And now we're looking out over one of the main streets in Pueblo. And I'm just seeing - you know, there's an outdoor store. There's a bar. There's a thrift store. It's a completely different town. GRADISAR: Right. No, it's gone through a lot of changes. SHAPIRO: I mean, I guess the question that I have to ask is, since that photo was taken more than 50 years ago, do you think Pueblo has changed for the better or the worse? GRADISAR: Oh, I think it's changed for the better. I think it's changed for the better. SHAPIRO: Really? GRADISAR: Yeah. I do. I do. Back when that photo was taken, the black smoke coming out of the mill was horrendous. I mean, we didn't appreciate it at the time, but, I mean, it was polluting the atmosphere something fierce. And since that time, obviously a lot of changes have taken place in terms of the environment, those kind of things. So I think Pueblo is better than it was 50 years ago. SHAPIRO: We talked to one of the union presidents in town, and he said his membership is down about 90% from when his parents and grandparents worked at the mill. GRADISAR: I agree with that, and I think that's one of the problems with the economy we have - not only in Pueblo, but in the country. That when we had good, strong unions, they were able to bargain collectively with their employers and share that wealth. Now there's nobody that can bargain collectively. There's no effective method of getting them to share that wealth. SHAPIRO: You think this election's going to turn it around. GRADISAR: Well, I hope it'll be the start. I hope it'll be the start. I think people recognize that it's out of balance. You know, it has to be in balance. The labor can't be too strong, and capitalism can't be too strong, but there needs to be that balance. And right now, it's out of balance. MARTIN: That was my ALL THINGS CONSIDERED co-host Ari Shapiro talking with Nick Gradisar, mayor of Pueblo, Colo. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Some Iowans who live below the poverty line feel disillusioned by national politics and don't feel as if they have the knowledge to participate in the caucus process.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: So, Rachel, I want to tell you about two people I met a few days ago. They live in the town of Lamoni. This is in Decatur County down near the Missouri border. We're hearing a lot about the caucuses. Neither of them caucused last night, and I want to tell you why. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Yeah. THERESA FARRELL: Hi, I'm Theresa Farrell (ph). I'm a grandmother of two, a mother of three. TODD SHERMAN: My name's Todd (ph). I'm married. I have an 8-year-old son with autism and a 4-year-old son. And I went to kindergarten through college all here in Lamoni. I kind of moved around to work and come back home to the poorest county in the state of Iowa. MARTIN: So the poorest county in Iowa. What does that look like? GREENE: It's interesting. I mean, there's a vibrant university there. And as you heard, both Todd - whose last name is Sherman (ph) - and Theresa have college education. But like a lot of families, theirs depends on this food pantry where I met them. Todd is currently not working. As you heard, he's caring for his son with autism. Theresa just started work at a truck stop. She had been in and out of employment, dealing with health problems. FARRELL: I've always battled with mental health issues - depression, anxiety. So about in 2007, I was in a car accident, and I sustained a traumatic brain injury, broke my arm, and it took a long time to recover from that. GREENE: So both Theresa and Todd are living below the poverty line. SHERMAN: So many variables. I'm one day away from losing everything. You know, I hate asking people for money, but if the option is either to ask my parents for money or to not have a gallon of milk in my fridge, I'm going to have to ask for money. MARTIN: So who are they asking? Who's helping them? GREENE: So they're getting help from family, but also federal assistance - disability, Medicaid. And they described to me this reality - if they take a job that pays even a little more, they could be dropped from some of these programs and actually be in worse shape. SHERMAN: If I do go and get a full-time job and we make too much money and then we get cut off of insurance, how much is it going to cost to insure a 43-year-old, a 32-year-old and a 4-year-old? I went to college for four years. I have $60,000 in student loans. That doesn't make sense. It's so frustrating. MARTIN: I mean, David, it's interesting - right? - that the role of the federal government in people's lives, in many ways, it is at the heart of this election. GREENE: Yeah. And when I spoke to both Theresa and Todd, I'd actually just been talking a few hours before that with a farmer in a town close by. He is voting for President Trump because he says the Democrats give away too much welfare. He said people should just go out and get a job. And I raised that with Theresa and Todd, and they talked about these misconceptions around poverty. FARRELL: I'm not stupid (laughter). I think that that's attached to a lot of it, is if she knew more, she'd do better, and that's not always the case. You know, I'm not lazy, and I'm not dumb, and I'm not trying to take anything from you (laughter). I feel guilty. I have guilt and shame. SHERMAN: I'm not lazy. I've worked for the last 10 years of my life. That is the stigma that's attached to poverty, is you live in a free house, you know, get free insurance. You know, that's not necessarily the case. MARTIN: So what about their political choices? GREENE: Well, I asked them. And this is so interesting - they are amongst so many lower-income Americans who feel like they are not part of the political process. Todd said politicians just don't get what he's going through. He was not going to caucus last night. Theresa was afraid because she feels like she lacks the knowledge to make an informed decision. FARRELL: I'm going to point a finger at my own political ignorance right now until I... GREENE: Don't call it ignorance. A lot of people don't have time to... FARRELL: It's just a - it's a big topic. GREENE: So Rachel, I reached back to Theresa last night. She was sick, so she couldn't go to caucus. But after our interview, she actually got in touch with the local Democratic Party chair and is hoping to get more involved soon. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Black voters came through for Joe Biden at pivotal moments on his path to the presidency: in South Carolina during the primaries, and in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania last week. And as the president-elect thanked his supporters on Saturday night in Delaware, he thanked Black supporters specifically. \"And especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest ebb, the African American community stood up again for me,\" Biden said. \"They always have my back, and I'll have yours.\" It was \"monumental\" to hear those words, says Branden Snyder, executive director of Detroit Action, a grassroots organization that focuses on building political power for the city's Black and brown working-class communities. \"We've worked as door knockers, we've worked as volunteers. But we actually haven't explicitly heard of the importance of our contributions,\" Snyder tells All Things Considered. When asked what he thinks Biden's pledge to have the Black community's \"back\" means, Snyder says he hopes it comes down to thanking them \"not with just applause, but with policy.\" In excerpts from the interview, he discusses what would help Black communities the most. Are there specific initiatives that you would like to see President Biden enact? When we think about policies that will both engage African American communities as well as ensure that we can think about the intersectional harms that have happened ... we have to be looking at things like housing, access to good jobs and really thinking about how we solve for environmental racism that we've seen throughout our communities. So I think that those are sort of the top three. But one I think that is going to be more crucial than all is really thinking about how do we respond to this pandemic and providing [really] just COVID relief ... how do we make sure that we have a policy that actually is just and fair for the relief of a pandemic \u2014 like another stimulus, like making sure we extend unemployment benefits, etc. Thirty percent of people in Detroit are below the poverty line. When the Biden administration says \"build back better,\" what does that actually look like in your city? For Detroiters, one of the places that we start when we talk about \"build back better\" is access to more living wage jobs, making sure that we're able to increase the federal minimum wage. It also looks like making sure that there's more access for small businesses to receive capital funding. It's making sure that we take the steps to rectify the harm of the criminal justice system. And, it means taking another step from what the Obama-era policies were \u2014 so refunding or funding more of the Second Chance Act, which is the criminal justice initiative. For the last four years, we have heard President Trump relentlessly refer to \"my voters, my people, my states.\" ... Do you think there's any risk of Biden making a similar mistake? No, no. One of the things that the Biden campaign is really [emphasizing] is the need to be the president for all communities. And that's actually what we didn't see from the Trump administration. The unfortunate strategy of the Trump administration was to divide and conquer, when the reality is that many of our communities could benefit from the same sort of policies. ... With a Biden administration, one of the things that they've really spoken highly of doing is being a president for all Americans, while at the same time recognizing and listening to the needs of our community. So I don't think that there will be the same sort of favoritism, if you will, and divide-and-conquer politics that the Trump administration has put forth.

            "article_content": "Voters in Kirkwood, Mo., cast ballots on Nov. 6, 2018 that helped decide the balance of power in Congress. Next week they'll get the chance to decide whether to expand Medicaid in their state. The measure could extend health coverage to more than 230,000 more Missourians.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Voters in Kirkwood, Mo., cast ballots on Nov. 6, 2018 that helped decide the balance of power in Congress. Next week they'll get the chance to decide whether to expand Medicaid in their state. The measure could extend health coverage to more than 230,000 more Missourians. Haley Organ thought she had everything figured out. After graduating from a small private college just outside Boston, she earned her master's degree, entered the workforce and eventually landed a corporate job in St. Louis as a data analyst. Life seemed to be going as planned until the national retailer that Organ worked for announced furloughs during the coronavirus pandemic. After nine weeks of mandatory leave, the 35-year-old was laid off. The company gave her a severance package and put an expiration date on her health insurance plan. \"I haven't slept the whole night since about March,\" Organ said, earlier this summer. \"I can't turn my brain off, just worrying about everything.\" Organ filed for unemployment, adding her claim to more than 40 million others nationwide since the pandemic took hold in mid-March, according to the Department of Labor. That's about 1 in 4 U.S. workers. As a result of the unemployment crisis, millions of people lost access to their private health insurance plans at a time when they might need it most. Medicaid, the federal and state health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, could have served as a safety net for Organ if she lived in one of the 38 states that have opted to expand eligibility under provisions of the Affordable Care Act. But in Missouri, Republicans who control both the governor's office and the legislature have said the state cannot afford its share of the cost of expansion and have been adamant foes of the ACA, helping lead a lawsuit now before the U.S. Supreme Court that may nullify the law. That opposition by state leaders has meant adults like Organ who don't have dependent children or specific disabilities cannot qualify for Missouri's Medicaid program \u2014 even if their incomes are well below the poverty line. \"This is literally the first time in my life I've had to worry about health care coverage,\" Organ says. \"It's kind of been a rude awakening for me.\" Voters in Missouri will decide Aug. 4 whether to expand eligibility for MO HealthNet (Missouri's Medicaid program) to provide insurance to more than 230,000 additional people in the state, including many who find themselves newly struggling for health coverage amid a national health crisis. More than 700,000 initial unemployment claims were reported in Missouri from mid-March through the first week of July. If Medicaid expansion passes in Missouri, coverage for those newly eligible people would begin in 2021. Advocates for the measure say Medicaid expansion would also create jobs, protect hospitals from budget cuts and bring billions of federal taxpayer dollars back to the state. Missouri is the latest red state to try expanding Medicaid with a ballot measure to circumvent recalcitrant legislatures. Oklahoma approved a measure June 30. Heartened by Oklahoma's win last month and positive polling, backers of Medicaid expansion are cautiously optimistic that Missouri voters will approve the measure Aug. 4. Missouri's Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who has said he opposes expanding Medicaid, moved the ballot measure from the general election in November to the primary election on Aug. 4. Democrats criticized the shift, noting that fewer voters traditionally turn out for the primary and suggesting it could be easier to defeat in August. The ongoing threat of COVID-19, they note, could also keep some voters away from the polls. Parson has said, in a written statement, that changing the election date will allow the state to prepare for the potential cost of expansion. But an analysis from Washington University in St. Louis suggests that expanding the program could save the state money by lowering the amount it must pay for uncompensated care and bolstering efforts to prevent certain diseases, thereby reducing treatment costs to the state. Under the terms of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government picks up 90% of the coverage costs for newly eligible enrollees, as compared with the 65% it pays for people who qualify under regular Medicaid rules. For people who qualify for the current Medicaid program, enrollment is open year-round, which means people can apply when needed. \"That's why we call them safety-net programs,\" says Jen Bersdale, executive director of Missouri Health Care for All, a group that has advocated for Medicaid expansion since 2012. \"When you get dropped from a job, dropped from insurance, they are there to catch you until you're back on your feet.\" Amid the pandemic, Medicaid already appears to be helping people newly out of work. In 22 states, Medicaid enrollment increased by an average 5% from February to May, according to Georgetown University Health Policy Institute data. Newer data for May in those same states suggests enrollment growth is accelerating. Even without expanding the program, Missouri leads the group with an 8.8% increase since February in total Medicaid enrollment. While economic recessions often contribute to increasing Medicaid enrollment, the early spike in Missouri could signify reenrollment of a large number of people, mostly children, who had been dropped from the program two years in a row. A federal rule blocks disenrollment during the pandemic. Even some Missourians already on Medicaid are worried about the ballot measure not passing. Without expansion of the program, Sally Terranova fears that her 16-year-old son, Colin, will be ineligible for Medicaid when he ages out of the kids' coverage at age 19. He was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2016. Terranova is concerned that her son wouldn't be able to afford the insulin he needs without insurance. She worries even more when she hears stories about diabetics rationing their insulin. \"It's bad enough he has this illness hanging over him,\" Terranova said. \"But he can live a good life and be healthy if he has access to health care.\" That's one reason Terranova, 39, hopes to land a job with good benefits when she finishes graduate school in a year and half. She has studied social work for the past four years, so she understands the challenges low-income families face. Terranova had moved from New York to Missouri to give her son a better life. They've called St. Louis home for 10 years, but the single mom is contemplating another big move for her son's health. She's thinking of going this time to a state that has already expanded its Medicaid program. Organ, whose health insurance expired in July, is now one of the lucky ones. She just got a new job that comes with employer-based health insurance, starting next week. Organ still hopes Missouri's Medicaid measure will pass, but instead of heading to a polling place Aug. 4, she is voting by mail. Now more than ever, she says, she appreciates just how important Medicaid can be if you lose your income and health coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I'm trying to do everything I can to keep me and others safe,\" Organ says. \"I want to make sure my voice is still heard.\" KHN is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.",

By Saturday night, clashes between rallygoers and counterprotesters escalated into violence, with four people stabbed and 33 people arrested into Sunday morning. Nine people were transported to hospitals, according to Washington, D.C.'s Fire and EMS Department. Two of the nine were police officers with injuries that were not life-threatening. Several groups that attended last month's protest marched again on Saturday. Those included the Proud Boys, a self-proclaimed \"Western-chauvinist\" organization known for violent confrontations with left-wing protesters. It's considered a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Police tried to separate the two sides. Counterprotesters also clashed with police at times, DCist reported. About 30 mins ago, an intense skirmish happened when about 30 to 40 Proud Boys emerged from the alley and approached counter protestors from behind. pic.twitter.com/ueD4tfD5lr A total of nine injured people were transported from D.C.'s downtown to hospitals after 7 p.m., the fire department said.

Reporter Jenny Gathright of NPR member station WAMU observed members of the Proud Boys marching through Freedom Plaza earlier Saturday. Some of them were holding up white power symbols. On Saturday morning, a White House spokesman confirmed that as the group gathered in D.C., one of its leaders, Enrique Tarrio, took a public tour of the White House. Tarrio posted about his visit to the right-wing social media app Parler. The White House says that Tarrio did not meet with the president, nor was he specifically invited.

And I say 1o, Donald J. Trump! 10!\" Flynn told the crowd. Flynn was pardoned by Trump late last month. He had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Louis Murray, who came from Boston, told WAMU that even if Trump's legal efforts to overturn the election fail, \"we can still celebrate Trumpism\" and \"get ready for 2024.\" \"This is a very hopeful day for conservatives in America,\" Murray told WAMU.

Socialists in Bolivia are celebrating a historic victory after a candidate handpicked by their ousted leader, Evo Morales, was on course to win the country's most important presidential election in a generation. Luis Arce \u2014 a former economy minister during the Morales era \u2014 is poised to be officially confirmed as the winner after his main rival conceded, even before the official count from Sunday's election was complete. Hours earlier, Morales, who is in exile in Argentina, announced what he called \"an unprecedented historic triumph\" and proclaimed, \"We recovered our democracy.\" The election followed the resignation last year of Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, after nearly 14 years in office. He left under pressure from Bolivia's military after seeking a fourth term in an election later annulled following fraud allegations. A report by the Organization of American States raising questions about the results fueled mass anti-government protests. Morales and his supporters maintain he was the victim of a right-wing coup. His departure in November laid the ground for Sunday's election, which was held despite the coronavirus pandemic and amid concerns that Bolivia's deeply polarized political scene could erupt into violence. Bolivians stocked up on food and other supplies ahead of the ballot. However, reports said that despite long lines at voting stations, the election went relatively smoothly. In the runup to the vote, most polls gave Arce a significant lead, although analysts said he would likely fall short of the numbers needed to avoid a second round next month against his main rival, Carlos Mesa. Conceding defeat at a news conference Monday, Mesa said initial counts showed a \"strong and clear\" win for Arce. \"It is up to us, those of us who believe in democracy, to recognize that there has been a winner in this election,\" Mesa said. The socialists' victory celebrations began earlier when the country's unelected interim president, Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, tweeted congratulations to Arce on his apparent victory while acknowledging the official count was not complete. \u00c1\u00f1ez, a right-wing archenemy of Morales, controversially took power after his departure. \"I congratulate the winners and I ask them to govern with Bolivia and democracy in mind,\" she said. Arce said he would seek to form a government of national unity and appealed for calm. The British-educated Arce, 57, served two terms as Bolivia's economy minister. He presided over a nationalization program and commodities boom that helped provide funds to lift millions of Indigenous Bolivians out of poverty and delivered a period of sustained growth. Mesa, 67, is a celebrated journalist and historian who served briefly as Bolivia's president from 2003 to 2005, and is widely considered a pragmatic centrist. A victory for Arce and the socialist party will be seen as a triumph for the Latin American left and for Morales, who is considered one of its heavyweights. However, the next president faces profound challenges. As in most of Latin America, COVID-19 has caused havoc within the health system and inflicted severe damage on the economy; the World Bank has forecast a drop in Bolivia's gross domestic product of at least 5.9% this year. With more than 8,400 deaths (and more than 139,000 confirmed cases), its 11.7 million population has one of the world's highest-recorded per capita mortality rates. \"Arce seems to have tapped most of the undecided vote,\" said Rodrigo Riaza, Bolivia analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \"The pandemic and the recession have taken a toll on people's trust in the alternative to the MAS,\" he said, referring to the Movimiento al Socialismo party. \"The key questions now is if the MAS will have an absolute majority in Congress,\" Riaza said. \"Without it, Arce's ability to govern will be severely impaired.\" Votes are still being counted from the congressional races, which were also on the ballot Sunday.",

            "article_content": "Bolivians voted for a new president on Sunday. The election \u2014 which was delayed twice \u2014 was the first since leftist icon Evo Morales was ousted almost a year ago.  NOEL KING, HOST: Bolivia held its most important presidential election in decades yesterday. Last year, you might remember the socialist leader Evo Morales was ousted and he fled the country. Now his legacy and his political heir are both on the ballot. NPR's South America correspondent Philip Reeves is in Brazil following the count. Good morning, Phil. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: Bolivia was in absolute turmoil last year. Remind us what happened there. REEVES: Well, you remember that Morales was pushed out after nearly 14 years in power. He actually resigned after an election that wound up being annulled because of allegations of fraud. He went into exile in Argentina, and an unelected right-wing interim government took over. And since then, Bolivia has been politically volatile and even more polarized. Morales and his supporters insist that he was a victim of a coup backed by the military who pushed him into leaving, and they still deny those allegations of election fraud. But, anyway, this election yesterday gave - gives Bolivians a chance to hit the reset button by restoring democracy after nearly a year. KING: And so who's on the ballot and who's the favorite? REEVES: Well, before the election, polls showed that the man handpicked by Morales to be presidential candidate for the Socialist Party was ahead, but probably didn't have enough to avoid a second round. He's a guy called Luis Arce. He's 57. He used to be economy minister during the Morales years and was deeply involved in a nationalization program that helped lift millions of Bolivians out of poverty. But his supporters are now claiming he's actually won outright. Morales himself has already declared him the winner. And Arce's been talking about forming a government. But this seems to be based on the findings of a couple of exit pollsters. Counting's still in the early stages. But if true, that would be a major development in Latin America, a sharp turn to the left that won't be welcomed in Washington. KING: A question that is relevant to U.S. listeners' interests - you've got a really polarized country, right? You've also got a pandemic. Were there any problems with voting there? REEVES: Yeah. Bolivia has been hard hit by COVID-19. In fact, it has one of the world's highest per capita infection rates. And, in fact, yesterday's election was postponed twice because of the pandemic. It was meant to be in May and then in September. Those postponements led to mass protests a couple of months ago, including a nationwide blockade, and that stoked up tensions along. And yesterday, people were very worried about what might happen. They stockpiled food and gas in case things turned violent. However, the vote seems to have been peaceful and orderly, although there were very long lines. Bolivians wore masks and socially distanced, and the authorities asked them to bring their own pens to the voting booths. KING: All of that sounds like a really good sign. When will there be a result? REEVES: Well, counting started, you know, after the polls closed yesterday, but it's been going very slowly. So far, only a small percentage of the votes are counted. The electoral authorities are saying they want to be careful; they want to wait until they have a result that's reliable before announcing anything. Yesterday, they suddenly scrapped plans to put out a rolling tally of early results 'cause they're trying to avoid the turmoil of last year's election - when the rolling count showed that the election was going to a second round, then everything stopped for 24 hours, and when it resumed, Morales was heading for an outright victory. But we may have to wait a while before we get an official announcement. KING: OK. NPR's Philip Reeves covering this story from Brazil. Thanks, Phil. REEVES: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "President Trump unexpectedly won Erie county in 2016. As the nation's attention turns to key swing regions in the country, voters there feel the pressure.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Are you ready for this? The election is just 50 days away. That means both candidates are focusing on key swing states. President Trump was in Nevada over the weekend, holding several events, including an indoor rally last night, which defied state regulations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had five sites, all outside sites like last night - tremendous room. And a great gentleman who owns this building said, you know what? What they're doing is really unfair. You can use my building. Don, I want to thank you. (APPLAUSE, CHEERING) MARTIN: The president there thanking a man who defied the state rules and let the president use his building. Another state up for grabs is Pennsylvania. President Trump's narrow victory there four years ago was a key to his winning the Electoral College. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea has been talking to voters in the northwest corner of the state in Erie County. It's one of the places Trump won unexpectedly last time and could be pivotal this go round. Good morning, Don. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Why is Erie County so significant in this vote? GONYEA: Across the country, there were only a couple hundred counties that had voted for President Obama when he was on the ballot and then flipped and voted for Donald Trump. One of them is Erie County, Pa. We all know how close Pennsylvania was. Erie County was one of the keys to Trump's victory there. And let's run the numbers. Obama, in '08, won the state by 20 points. He won by almost as much again in 2012. 2016, Trump wins it by 1,957 votes - so, so close. The city of Erie has a large working-class population. In some ZIP codes, poverty's among the worst in the country. There's a locomotive plant that the union there says has lost half of its workforce in the past decade. Four years ago, all of that made it ripe for Donald Trump's anti-trade, anti-NAFTA rhetoric. There are new challenges, obviously, for Trump this time, including that unemployment has spiked due to the pandemic. MARTIN: You've been all over the county talking to voters. What are they telling you? GONYEA: We'll hit the city of Erie. That's a Democratic stronghold. The outlying rural areas are less populous. Trump needs to rack up huge margins there. My very first stop was at an amusement park right on Lake Erie. That's where the county GOP was holding an outdoor picnic. And if you're looking for a metaphor for the election, there was an old roller coaster making lots of noise right nearby where I was doing interviews. (SOUNDBITE OF ROLLER COASTER) GONYEA: The very first person I talked to at the picnic was Mark Schumacher. He is retired after working three decades at a local prison. He says he supports the police and Trump's law-and-order message. He just likes the way Trump handles himself. MARK SCHUMACHER: For the first time, we got a politician who knows how to do it 'cause he ain't no politician. He's the real deal. GONYEA: To a person, these Trump voters give the president full credit for the strong economy pre-pandemic and no blame for the current economic slump. Forty-four-year-old Kori Curtis owns a farm. I spoke to her out at the county GOP headquarters, where she was picking up 20 Trump lawn signs. She does allow that Trump's response to the pandemic has not been perfect, but she quickly says no one else would have done better. I asked her about the revelations in Bob Woodward's new book and the tapes of Trump himself saying he played down the pandemic early on to avoid panic. KORI CURTIS: Why wouldn't you react that way? I mean, you don't want the country in a panic. It was scary when it started. That's never happened in our lifetime. So I could understand that you would set back a little in what you say so that we didn't go into a frenzy. GONYEA: But another voter, registered independent Mary Ann Frontino, who lives on the eastern edge of the county, near the New York state line, says Trump's spin on his interview with Woodward is just beyond belief. MARY ANN FRONTINO: Well, panic is his middle name. I mean, his entire campaign is trying to dig up panic so people will vote for him. GONYEA: Frontino is 65 and a lifelong Republican who says she officially changed her voter registration to independent last year because she could no longer be a member of the same party as Donald Trump. She is voting for Joe Biden. Another Biden supporter I met, 44-year-old Abdullah Washington, helps organize the city of Erie's annual Blues & Jazz Fest. He says there are times he wishes Biden was doing more to energize young people, especially African Americans. But he also says this. ABDULLAH WASHINGTON: And I think - I would say it's more about hope than it is about excitement at this point. GONYEA: He says Biden helped himself by choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate. Washington also says that part of Biden's appeal is the promise of a return to normalcy. And he predicts that Trump's scare tactics about rioters and antifa destroying the suburbs just won't fly. WASHINGTON: But you got to understand, like, people who live in the suburbs, a lot of them work in the cities. You know? And so it's not like they have a one-sided experience with people of color. MARTIN: So Don, after all these conversations, what's your takeaway from Erie? GONYEA: Let me play one more voice for you. This is the local union president at the locomotive plant. Scott Slawson says you can feel the tension around town. SCOTT SLAWSON: It's, like, yeah. It's, like, charged. I don't know how to explain it, but it is. It's like everybody's just like a cat waiting to pounce. GONYEA: In everyday life? SLAWSON: Yeah. GONYEA: Adding to the tension, I heard from voters on both sides saying they are worried that the other side is going to try to steal the election through some voting shenanigans. MARTIN: Wow - tension in everyday life. Don, we'll be following you and the voters in Pennsylvania. Thanks so much. GONYEA: My pleasure. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It has been only a month since President Trump held his last campaign rally. It was March 2 when several thousand people squeezed into a North Carolina arena to cheer on a confident president seeking reelection at a time of peace and prosperity. Trump touted the record low unemployment rate to rousing applause, repeating the theme of his 2020 campaign. \"Jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging,\" said the president. And so Trump's campaign would have gone, a big arena rally once a week, building up to more as the general election nears. An army of door-knocking volunteers to make sure that the hundreds of thousands who attended a Trump rally are registered to vote. But a campaign plan that made sense a month ago has run headlong into the coronavirus pandemic. Almost overnight, millions have lost their jobs as measures to slow the spread of the virus forced business practically to a halt. More than 5,000 Americans have died from the disease as of Thursday morning, and Trump recently said that if 100,000 Americans die, \"we all, together, have done a very good job.\" Trump and his campaign no longer talk about a strong economy in the present tense. At this point, the campaign's message is all about the coronavirus. \"We are supporting President Trump's exceptional leadership and highlighting the work being done to keep Americans safe and healthy during this unprecedented time,\" said a campaign aide on background when asked how the reelection effort was adjusting. Volunteers prepare to sell official Trump merchandise before a campaign rally on Feb. 10 in Manchester, N.H.

With rallies and in-person organizing no longer possible, the Trump campaign has moved online. The Trump campaign's headquarters in Virginia are closed because of the state's stay-at-home order. Staff are working from home and have started doing virtual events \u2014 something Trump's Democratic opponents are also doing. Kicking off a streaming event last week, Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, told viewers, \"We're so happy to have you join us. This is a first for us.\" WATCH LIVE: Women for Trump with Lara Trump, Kayleigh McEnany, and Chris Carr! #WomenforTrumpLIVE Text EMPOWER to 88022 https://t.co/H0ym5ySzjC She was joined by campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany and national political director Chris Carr, all beaming in from their respective homes. The streamed event included tips for surviving life stuck at home, information on volunteering for the campaign, a dash of media bashing and a plenty of praise for Trump. \"Right now the president is saving lives across this country,\" McEnaney said at one point. \"This could have been so much worse.\" There were video and audio problems. At one point, McEnany disappeared, replaced on screen by a black box with a question mark. Despite the glitches, the video has been watched about a million times across various platforms. Everything about the campaign has also been forced to move online. In mid-March, just as Trump was announcing his administration's initial social distancing guidelines, the campaign and the Republican Party were supposed to be launch a nationwide week of in-person volunteer training events. \"We said, 'You know what, we're going to make this switch to completely virtual,' \" said Elliott Echols, the national field director for the Trump Victory Campaign. \"Everything we have scheduled we're going to get it switched over.\" According to Echols, within 24 hours, the training sessions moved from living rooms and field offices to Zoom meetings, forcing many volunteers to adjust to a new technology. Those training sessions culminated in a day of action, with volunteers and organizers making more than 3 million phone calls. But the recommended call script was anything but a standard campaign call. Volunteers were asked to check in on how people were doing and direct them to coronavirus.gov. Echols says that on one of these calls, a campaign organizer spoke to an elderly woman in Florida afraid to go grocery shopping. So, the organizer asked for a list and delivered the groceries to her door. \"That's what it's about,\" Echols said. \"Our program is built off of relationship organizing.\" NPR asked to speak with the Florida woman, but the campaign did not make her available. The campaign uses voter contact apps that work from a computer or cellphone. If the call goes to voicemail, the app automatically plays a prerecorded message from Lara Trump urging voters to \"stop the spread of coronavirus by practicing social distancing, good hygiene and making sure to wash your hands.\" Echols looks forward to a day when people can return to public spaces and start knocking on doors again. \"We're going to flip that switch again and the volunteers that were making the calls, they're going to be back at those people's doorsteps continuing the conversation with them,\" he said. Down the road, the campaign hopes the familiarity that volunteers get from using the voter contact apps now will allow them to work in campaign calls at free moments during the day this summer and fall, said Mandi Merritt, national press secretary for the Republican National Committee. \"It allows them to make calls on behalf of the president at a time that is convenient for them,\" said Merritt.

Democratic groups have started to run ads aimed at countering Trump's daily briefings. So far, the campaign isn't running ads about the coronavirus or Trump's response to it. But it may not be necessary. Recent polls show a small bump in Trump's approval rating as he holds daily press briefings about the coronavirus. The rallies may be gone, but Trump has a more direct line into American homes than ever before. This helps explain why Democratic groups have started to run ads aimed at countering Trump's daily briefings, drawing attention to statements he has made in recent weeks that have turned out to be off-base and wrong. \"The fact that he chooses to use that pulpit to share misinformation and to deceive, I think is the challenge,\" said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC. \"And I think that's why you find more of us who are willing to apply pressure to bring attention to some of the misinformation.\" He ignored intelligence.He ignored experts.He ignored science.As the number of sick skyrockets, Trump thinks he's done \"one hell of a job.\"Watch the updated ad Trump doesn't want Americans to see and help us continue to hold him accountable.https://t.co/ZeRIriA3Y8 pic.twitter.com/2in9JP6ire The Trump campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter trying to get a recent Priorities USA ad taken down, saying Trump was quoted out of context. Instead, Priorities USA increased the size of its ad buy. The political stakes are high.

Bernie Sanders talks about his plan to deal with the coronavirus pandemic during a virtual round table with supporters on March 17.\n                \n                    \n                    berniesanders.com via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders talks about his plan to deal with the coronavirus pandemic during a virtual round table with supporters on March 17. Lagging in the Democratic presidential primary and facing the unique challenge of running for office amid the coronavirus pandemic, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says he is still assessing his campaign's future. \"It's changing every day because elections are being delayed,\" Sanders said in an interview with Morning Edition's Noel King. \"Where do we go from here with the elections that are being delayed, where we can't go out and hold rallies or knock on doors? That's what we're looking at right now,\" Sanders said. Virtual campaigning has become the new normal for Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden with the coronavirus putting a halt to almost any in-person events or retail politicking. Both candidates have been holding online round tables, almost solely focused on the growing health crisis and the Trump administration's response to it. Biden currently holds a more than 300 delegate lead in the race for the Democratic nomination. During an online press conference Wednesday, Biden was asked about whether there should be more Democratic primary debates and answered, \"I think we've had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.\" Sanders conceded that he substantially lagged Biden in the race, saying \"it's going to be a very steep road,\" but said there was value to holding more debates. \"I think the American people, especially in this unprecedented moment in American history, want to hear the ideas that will lead us away from where we are right now,\" said Sanders, referring to his plans for the economy, criminal justice reform and climate change. \"These are enormously important issues and we need serious debates over them.\" Sanders said that the kind of policies he's championed throughout his career are gaining resonance, and pointed to the Senate's passage Wednesday of a $2 trillion economic relief package. \"People might not have thought that the United States Congress, the Republican president, the Republican Senate would do what they did,\" Sanders said. \"There's a reason for that. And that is that millions of people are now demanding that we have a government that works for all. What role should the campaign play in continuing that fight to make sure that health care becomes a human right, not a privilege, that we raise the minimum wage to a living wage, et cetera, et cetera,\" he mused. Sanders said the pandemic has caused Americans to rethink the nature of the role that government can play in their lives. \"I think there is growing sentiment in this country that people now understand that it is incomprehensible that we remain the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all, that we have an economy which leaves half of our people...living paycheck to paycheck,\" Sanders said. \"What kind of system is it where people today are dying, knowing they're sick, but they're not going to the hospital because they can't afford the bill that they'll be picking up?\" Sanders told King he's convinced the Senate's emergency relief package will be followed with another \"massive\" bill within the next month. \"I think given the nature of the healthcare crisis and the economic crisis, Congress will be back once again for a major, major stimulus package,\" Sanders said.",

            "article_content": "President Trump fires the nation's election security czar. A recent shake-up in Pentagon senior leadership raises many questions. Up to 12 million Americans could lose jobless benefits after Dec. 25.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Just over two months before he leaves office, the president has fired a top Homeland Security official. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The outgoing president removed Christopher Krebs for an accurate report about the election. Krebs oversaw an Internet security office that assessed election security. A statement by his office called it the most secure election in American history. This matches the findings of election officials across the country. It did not, however, match the president's false claims of fraud. Those claims are so baseless that in the court, the president's lawyers have been repeatedly forced to say they're not even alleging fraud because, of course, you cannot lie in court. So far, the suits have failed to change a single vote. INSKEEP: NPR's Miles Parks covers election security and has been following all this. Miles, good morning. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: I'm not sure that a lot of people would have heard of Christopher Krebs before his firing. Who is he and what role has he played through this election? PARKS: Right. He's basically been the federal official in charge of coordinating the election security efforts across this country. You know, there's more than 10,000 individual voting jurisdictions across the U.S. And four years ago, they were not communicating about threat information and, honestly, much about best practices in the field. So Krebs has kind of overseen this overhaul within the federal government to change that. Here he is in October, warning that it takes a while for election results to be certified after Election Day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRISTOPHER KREBS: So be patient. That's a lot of opportunity space for the bad guys, whoever they are, to come in and try to sow chaos, sow doubt, in the integrity of the process. And remember, attempts to delegitimize the election aren't going to stop on Election Day. PARKS: In terms of his reputation, Krebs was respected by Republicans and Democrats alike on Capitol Hill. And one official who worked with Krebs that I talked to last week said he was, quote, \"easily the most competent and able of any political appointee I've worked with\" if that gives you an impression. INSKEEP: And I'm just thinking about the words we just heard talking about people coming in to sow chaos, sow doubt in the integrity of the process. Attempts to delegitimize the election are not going to stop on Election Day. He's describing what the president has done over the past couple of weeks. PARKS: Yeah. It's sort of ominous at this point hearing that clip. And you've kind of seen this happen from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency that Krebs oversaw. Over the last couple of weeks, misinformation there has become maybe their biggest component of election security. A few weeks back, Krebs' agency started this website called Rumor Control aimed at fighting bad voting information. Now, Krebs has been completely adamant that this was not a website meant - started to fact-check Trump. But since the Trump campaign has been the biggest spreader of voting misinformation lately, that's essentially what that website has been forced to focus on. The agency has been debunking many of the claims that the president's lawyers, as Rachel mentioned, have been making in court and in public. So it's hard to say that last night's outcome of Krebs being fired is a complete surprise even to Krebs You know, somebody close to him that I talked to said he thought of this Rumor Control website as a sort of calculated risk considering how often President Trump makes false claims about voting. There was a chance that these two things were going to come into conflict. INSKEEP: And we got to be clear, people are showing themselves to lie by saying one thing in public and then going in court where they can't lie and they make much more limited claims. And even the limited claims have been failing in suits so far. But we've gotten to this point and now Krebs has been fired. Does his ousting matter? PARKS: Yeah. I mean, the impression I have from election officials is that they're definitely thankful this happened now and not a month or two ago before, you know, November 3. But it does still matter. Transitions are notoriously fragile times for national security. And Krebs was the person in charge in the federal government of defending the whole U.S. government against cyberattacks. But it's not like this security work just stops with Krebs out. One official at DHS told me that this move will actually only serve to motivate people working on election officials within the agency. INSKEEP: Now, Miles, amid this firing and all of these false claims that have failed again and again and again in courts of law, there was an unusual development last night in Michigan that briefly, briefly got a lot of attention on social media. Would you describe who did what? PARKS: Yeah. So this is in Wayne County, the county that encompasses Detroit. Basically, the local county board of canvassers was scheduled to meet to certify, but, you know, it sounds familiar now, partisan gridlock took over briefly. The board's two Republicans initially voted against certifying the results based on what they called security concerns, even though there's no evidence anything fraudulent happened here, they backtracked on that, as you mentioned. They did end up certifying the results, reaching a compromise to instead request the secretary of state to conduct an audit on issues in the election. So the bottom line here is that, you know, even though the Trump campaign is celebrating this as a win, it will not have any effect on the final results in Michigan. Joe Biden won Michigan by more than 100,000 votes, and there's still no evidence anything nefarious happened here or, frankly, anywhere in the country widespread. INSKEEP: So this brief hold up fit in with the Trump campaign's disinformation efforts about urban democratic fraud and that sort of thing. But even the Republicans who did it backed off after a couple of hours and things moved forward. PARKS: Right. And, you know, you can expect - you saw President Trump tweet about this, calling - you know, celebrating it as a big win. You can probably expect similar things in the coming days. This has been the Trump campaign game plan at this point is, you know, celebrating these minor bureaucratic wins that don't actually have an effect on the underlying election results, those results being the results that show Joe Biden won the election by a fairly wide margin. INSKEEP: NPR's Miles Parks, thanks for your reporting. PARKS: Thank you, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: We now have a better idea why the departing president changed leadership at the Pentagon. MARTIN: Shortly after losing the election, President Trump fired the defense secretary. Now it seems clear the move cleared the way for an announcement on Afghanistan. The new acting secretary of defense, Christopher Miller, made a statement yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRISTOPHER MILLER: I'm here today to update you on President Trump's plan to bring the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to a successful and responsible conclusion and to bring our brave service members home. INSKEEP: That was the statement. NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman was listening and joins us. Tom, good morning. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: Does what Miller said mean that all troops are coming home? BOWMAN: Not at all. Thousands of troops will still remain in both countries. Now, the Taliban are resurgent in Afghanistan, and they have not stopped attacking cities, and they've not broken with al-Qaida. Both are key conditions of the U.S.-Taliban agreement in February. And in Iraq, those U.S. troops continue to go after remnants of the Islamic State, not just in Iraq, Steve, but in neighboring Syria as well; so no conclusion by a long shot. The White House has mandated a troop reduction in Afghanistan, going from about 4,500 to 2,500 by January 15 and a smaller drawdown of 500 in Iraq to 2,500. It will happen. These are orders from the commander in chief. INSKEEP: OK. But when you say it will happen, we're in a world where we have to describe that the words don't mean what they mean. Concluding the war, which is what he said, doesn't mean the war is concluding. Bringing our troops home doesn't actually mean the troops are coming home, but there is a reduction in troops. Did Acting Secretary Miller say anything about how conditions have changed in a way that will allow some of the troops to come home? BOWMAN: Steve, he said nothing. He took no questions. And before he spoke, a senior Defense official, who insisted on being unnamed, repeatedly refused to talk about the specific conditions leading to the cuts. Steve, the bottom line is this - the president campaigned on getting troops home. He's doing it. And officials are not being honest that this is fulfilling a campaign pledge. It has little to do with the deliberate, reasoned reduction the military wants. INSKEEP: Although when you say he's doing it, they're still not actually doing it if some troops are going to remain. So what does all this mean for the Biden administration that does take over January 20? BOWMAN: Well, probably not too much. The remaining troops can focus on counterterrorism, which is what Biden wants. And he has said he would like to keep a few thousand troops in Afghanistan for that purpose. And the sense is he and his advisers will be deliberate, holding the Taliban to their agreement, not just make a knee-jerk announcement as we see here. INSKEEP: All of this comes as we're hearing of a White House meeting where there were discussions of possible missile strikes on Iran. And I want to emphasize the word possible. How do those things match up with bringing troops home? BOWMAN: Well, they really don't. As far as this, we know there was a meeting with the president's most senior advisers and we know that Acting Defense Secretary Miller, Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, all opposed any kind of military action with Iran. There was no indication the president is going forward with it. Some fear that could escalate and threaten the U.S. forces in the region if that happened. INSKEEP: Tom, thanks so much. BOWMAN: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Tom Bowman. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. Up to 12 million Americans could lose their jobless benefits right after Christmas. MARTIN: That's according to a new study that was released by The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. Congress has been at a standstill over a new economic relief package since the summer. And as the coronavirus continues to spread out of control, many parts of the U.S. are facing new lockdowns. INSKEEP: NPR's Chris Arnold has been covering the economic effects of the pandemic and is on the line. Chris, good morning. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Hey, Steve. INSKEEP: So it sounds like a lot of people are going to be in trouble right at the end of the holidays. ARNOLD: Yeah. And the simple version of what's going on is back when the pandemic hit, Congress passed this big relief package, the CARES Act. Do you remember that? And so what that did is two things. It expanded the universe of people who can qualify to get unemployment benefits. And, you know, some of them are self-employed or a bunch of different things. And it extended the amount of time that people could collect them because it's a big national crisis. It's what we do in recessions, as has happened before. But two big federal programs that are part of that expire on the same day. It's the day after Christmas. I spoke to Andrew Stettner with the liberal-leaning Century Foundation, which did the study. ANDREW STETTNER: Congress is set to cut off 12 million Americans from the only thing holding them back from falling into, you know, poverty and hardships that could scar them and their children for a lifetime. ARNOLD: And he says, look, you know, this is happening at the worst possible time. Anybody who's had the radio or the TV on knows the virus is raging around the country. He says this could be, quote, \"a crippling end to one of our darkest years.\" INSKEEP: With all that said, Chris, the unemployment rate, while it's really bad, is not as bad as some feared and has actually been improving. Aren't some people in a better situation than it might have been? ARNOLD: Sure. I mean, some people might be able to find unemployment rates coming down, but there are still 10 million fewer jobs than before the recession hit. That's a lot of jobs. And so in many states, too, things are going in the wrong direction. Things are being locked down, restaurants, et cetera, more than they're opening up. And a lot of people just don't have good options. INSKEEP: What are you hearing from some of the people looking for work? ARNOLD: I spoke to Todd Anderson (ph) in northern Michigan. He's a single dad. He's got four kids. He's been going through this, including two, you know, 5-year-old twins. And in the spring, he lost his landscaping job. He did stuff for resorts that hold big weddings and that went out the window. And the unemployment money for him just hasn't been enough. He's been selling off his belongings to try to make money - cabinets, he had a pair of hiking boots. TODD ANDERSON: And I sold tools - tools of my trade I sold hoping that, hey, I can rebuy them as I get on my feet. ARNOLD: And to save money, he was living in this tiny cabin in the woods with his kids, and he says they didn't even have furniture, like a real table to eat at and stuff. But winter was coming, and so that wasn't going to work. So he was able to borrow just a little bit of money from family to get a security deposit together so that he and his kids could move into actually just a small house. ANDERSON: I sat down the first night after we moved in, and they watched me cry because we could sit around a table, and we didn't do that for six months. So to be able to have dinner together, as a dad, that's kind of important to me. So we just try to muscle through. I try not to tell them that we're broke. ARNOLD: But, you know, Steve, Anderson's unemployment money barely covers the rent. And he says if Congress doesn't extend those benefits, he just doesn't know what he and his kids are going to do. Meanwhile, there just isn't any indication that Congress is on the cusp of working this out and compromising and getting a deal together this year. There's a lot of people pushing for it but not a whole lot of action happening on extending those benefits. INSKEEP: Chris, thanks for the update, really appreciate it. ARNOLD: Thanks, Steve.

Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy had been assassinated, and the country was embroiled in protests over the war in Vietnam. That summer, several prominent anti-war activists, including Abbie Hoffman and Tom Hayden, were accused of crossing state lines and conspiring to start a riot at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The trial that followed transfixed the nation. West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin recreates the activists' trial in his new Netflix film, The Trial of the Chicago 7. He says this story is \"shockingly, chillingly relevant\" \u2014 and points to parallels between the unrest in Chicago in 1968 and the political divisions of today. \"I saw a photograph [of counter-protesters] from 1969, when the trial was starting,\" Sorkin says. \"Three of the signs that I saw said: 'America, Love It or Leave It,' 'What About White Civil Rights?' and 'Lock Them Up.' \" Sorkin notes that those signs \u2014 and the broader demonization of the protesters \u2014 recalls President Trump's reaction to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations of 2020. \"We thought the film was plenty relevant last winter when we were making it. We didn't need it to get more relevant, but it did,\" Sorkin says. On what made him want to tell the story of the Chicago Seven Fourteen years ago, [Steven Spielberg told me] he wanted to make a movie about the Chicago Seven. And I said, \"That's a great idea. That would make a great movie. Count me in and sign me up!\"And I walked out of his house, called my father, and asked him who the Chicago Seven were. I didn't have any idea what Steven was talking about. I was just saying yes to working with Steven Spielberg the way literally any writer would. So then I had research to do, obviously. I read about a dozen good books on the subject, a number of them written by members of the Chicago Seven. And there's a 21,000 page trial transcript. But the most critical part of the research was the time I got to spend with Tom Hayden, who was still alive at the time. ... And he gave me an insight that I would not have been able to get from those books or from the transcript. On why the film feels particularly relevant now When suddenly Donald Trump was at rallies, when a protester in the back would shout something and he'd be getting dragged out and Trump would start reminiscing about the good old days when we'd carry that guy out of here on a stretcher, and I'd like to punch him right in the face and beat the crap out of him. When protest was being demonized. Whether it was an athlete kneeling during the national anthem, that's what was going on that made Steven finally say, \"OK, the time to make this movie is now.\" ... With the shootings of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery and [the death of] George Floyd, the protests and protesters being met by, again, tear gas and nightsticks and calls from the government that they're anti-American, that they're anarchists, that they're communists \u2014 when in fact, they're patriots. On portraying Judge Julius Hoffman, who demonstrates disdain for the defendants He was awful \u2014 more awful than I made him just because I couldn't show you five and a half months of trial. He was either in the tank for the prosecution or experiencing early senility or some combination of both. But most likely what it was, and you see this again today ... was he felt that he was the guardian of the America of the '50s or at least the America in his imagination, that the '50s were a quieter, whiter time without all this crazy psychedelic music, and these kids and their long hair and the clothes protesting things that he thought he was the last line of defense against these guys, and he was going to put them away and teach them a lesson. Filmmaker Aaron Sorkin isn't bothered by critics who say his writing style is too idealistic. \"I get to earn a living doing exactly what I love doing,\" he says.\n                \n                    \n                    Niko Tavernise/Netflix\n                    \n                \nhide caption Filmmaker Aaron Sorkin isn't bothered by critics who say his writing style is too idealistic. \"I get to earn a living doing exactly what I love doing,\" he says. On a common criticism that his writing style is too idealistic Honest to God, the thing that I think about the most is that I get to earn a living doing exactly what I love doing and what you're talking about, those are pretty glamorous problems, that critics talk about me in a certain way. When I was writing my first play, A Few Good Men on cocktail napkins at the bar I was working at, and you had told me that my problem was going to be the way critics talked about my writing, I would have hugged you and said, \"Really? There's going to be a day when I'm reviewed by somebody?\" I know exactly what you're talking about, but it's been going on for a while, so I'm used to it. On whether 2020 has made him less of an idealistic writer and thinker I do like writing idealistically and optimistically. As an audience member I like cynical things, gritty things. I'm fine with things that don't have a happy ending. But as a writer, I like writing the kinds of movies that made me want to write movies, and those were usually movies that put a lump in my throat, gave me a goosebump experience, just made me feel two inches taller after I had watched it. I like doing that. There have been a couple of exceptions along the way and there'll probably be a couple of exceptions in my future. I like it when the orchestra comes in. On writing about Trump-era politics for the screen There's no such thing as an interesting character who doesn't have a conscience. If you take Richard III's conscience away from him, we're not interested in that play. Aaron Sorkin I've just, in the last week, passed on two different things that would involve the character of Donald Trump. ... Believe me, screenwriters, playwrights, television writers, we're going to be writing a lot about these last four years. But I predict that \u2014 The Comey Rule notwithstanding \u2014 that you will seldom see [a fictionalized version of] Donald Trump as anything but an off-screen character. ... Having him as a character in a story with real people is very difficult, because it's implausible. It's very hard to not make him like Alec Baldwin on SNL because, as I say, he is implausible. Also, you can write about heroes and villains or anti-heroes like Mark Zuckerberg, but there's no such thing as an interesting character who doesn't have a conscience. If you take Richard III's conscience away from him, we're not interested in that play. Ann Marie Baldonado and Seth Kelley produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

The candidates revealed their differences when each spoke this year at a historic site. Trump spoke July Fourth at Mount Rushmore. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN PHILIP SOUSA'S \"THE WASHINGTON POST\") INSKEEP: A band played John Philip Sousa, and the president stood before a tightly packed crowd with the mountain sculpture behind him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There could be no better place to celebrate America's independence than beneath this magnificent, incredible, majestic mountain monument to the greatest Americans who have ever lived. INSKEEP: In the fading light, spotlights illuminated the giant stone faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: This monument will never be desecrated. (CHEERING) TRUMP: These heroes will never be defaced. (CHEERING) TRUMP: Their legacy will never, ever be destroyed. JILL LEPORE: Well, the monument at Mount Rushmore is a monument that is a celebration of the greatness of the American presidency. INSKEEP: We asked historian Jill Lepore about both speeches. LEPORE: Trump was using this as an occasion to argue that American history is under siege, that the vision of the United States and its past that he wants his followers to believe his presidency represents is under attack by a group that he refers to kind of first as kind of the radical far left or left-wing fascists, angry mobs. And then somehow this devolves into simply liberal Democrats. INSKEEP: Some cities and states have torn down statues of Confederate leaders who took up arms against the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They are determined to tear down every statue, symbol and memory of our national heritage. INSKEEP: Heritage can just mean heritage, but it's also a common euphemism for Confederate relics. Some protesters this year have also targeted statues of presidents linked with slavery. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Make no mistake - this left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution. In so doing, they would destroy the very civilization that rescued billions from poverty, disease, violence and hunger and that lifted humanity to new heights of achievement, discovery and progress. INSKEEP: Trump's defiance differs from Biden's speech at a historic site. He stepped before a small crowd and removed his mask to speak at Gettysburg, Pa. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: Thank you. I appreciate you being here on this gorgeous day in a magnificent, magnificent setting, til you think about all the lives that were lost here. INSKEEP: A cemetery holds thousands killed on Gettysburg's green hills in 1863. It's a semicircle of white headstones. LEPORE: So if Trump chose, you know, a monument to the American presidency, Biden chose a graveyard - right? - a prayerful place, a site of grief and loss and devastation and suffering. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: All this in a time not just of ferocious division but of widespread death, structural inequity and fear of the future. INSKEEP: Biden used that site to warn against the cost of political division today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Instead of treating each other's party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country, a spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I've been saying it for two years now, I'm accused of being naive. I'm told maybe that's the way things used to work, Joe, but they can't work that way anymore. Well, I'm here to tell you they can. INSKEEP: Trump's speech also mentioned unity, but Jill Lepore says he spoke more of his followers' unity against opponents. LEPORE: You know, Trump's speech is, frankly, quite militaristic. I mean, it actually is very hawkish in a way - in the same way that Biden's speech at Gettysburg was quite dovish. It's just that they're not talking about a U.S. foreign policy intervention. They're not hawks and doves about Vietnam or Iraq or Afghanistan. They're sort of hawks and doves about civil war. I mean, Trump's sort of saying bring it on and Biden saying, please, dear God, you know, let's stop this madness. INSKEEP: Different though they are, both speeches quote the most famous line in American history. Trump spoke of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They enshrined a divine truth that changed the world forever when they said all men are created equal. INSKEEP: In 1863, Abraham Lincoln quoted the declaration's words when he dedicated the cemetery at Gettysburg. And at that cemetery, Joe Biden quoted Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. INSKEEP: Something important is happening in those lines. Trump refers to the nation's founding when Jefferson wrote the nation's creed of equality. Biden refers to what historians call the second founding, when Lincoln and others redefined the United States. An explicitly white republic changed itself by law to be multiracial. Today, Jill Lepore says two presidential candidates are invoking that past as America changes again. LEPORE: Trump's speech is very kind of Old Testament. There's an angry God here. There's a lot of wrath coming upon us. And Biden's seeking out the place where Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg, you know, not long before he was himself assassinated is very much of a New Testament speech about suffering and redemption. INSKEEP: They spoke of the same country, the same history from different angles. One thing Americans decide this election season is which idea of America they most endorse. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Because we will never forget that the American freedom exists for American greatness. And that's what we have, American greatness. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: We can end this era of division. We can end the hate and the fear. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. We can do this. (CHEERING) Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "As next month's elections near, the NPR podcast Throughline dives into the history of voting in the United States, and asks why the process went from a public affair to a private one.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: We have always had many ways to vote here in the United States. But at the beginning of American democracy, it was much more varied than just mailing in a ballot or standing in line to vote like we see today. It was also far less equitable. The hosts of Throughline, Rund Abdelfatah and Ramtin Arablouei, have been exploring the history of voting. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) RAMTIN ARABLOUEI: It all started with voice voting. JILL LEPORE: Viva voce is the Latin for that. ARABLOUEI: Viva voce - literally, living voice - was one of the earliest forms of voting, where you - assuming you're a white landowning man - basically shouted your vote from the rooftops in front of all of your neighbors, usually while fighting over a keg, a candidate-sponsored keg, no less. And the whole day is basically a huge party. LEPORE: 'Cause remember - it's Election Day. It's a holiday. There's a ton of drinking. Everybody's there. It's, like, a big, like, tailgate party. Like, it's a big celebration of public life. RUND ABDELFATAH: This is Jill Lepore. LEPORE: I teach American history at Harvard, and I am a staff writer for The New Yorker, and I also host a podcast called \"The Last Archive.\" ABDELFATAH: There were lots of ways to vote, from viva voce to writing your candidate's name on a scrap of paper - if you knew how to write at all. Some counted beans or bullets or kernels of corn, and others would stand on opposite sides of the town square for a poll, a physical counting of heads. But one thing was for sure. LEPORE: It was important, politically, that voting be open. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ABDELFATAH: How you voted was left up to the states to decide. Meanwhile, as each state was designing its own process, there was another system taking shape, too - political parties. LEPORE: And so political parties began trying to think about how to make sure that they're maximizing the votes of their supporters. ABDELFATAH: And they realized they could tap into one of the most exciting advances of the early 19th century - printing, cheap printing. ARABLOUEI: This was all happening at a time when more and more men could not only read but vote. By the end of the 1820s, most states had adopted universal white male suffrage - meaning you didn't have to own land anymore. You didn't even need any money. You just needed to be a white guy who could get your hands on a party ticket. LEPORE: They were giant sheets of paper, these, you know, flaming red or bright blue ballots - right? - that signaled your party loyalty. ARABLOUEI: This empowered the party system. And the more solidified the parties, the more splintered the public, which set off a whole new set of problems. LEPORE: It became extremely dangerous to vote. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARABLOUEI: Violence and intimidation wreaked havoc on elections, especially for those voting in the minority. But this wasn't the only problem with the party ticket system run by corrupt party bosses. People soon realized that they could use their vote for something other than voting - they could use it to eat. LEPORE: And people, you know, sell their votes for a sandwich. ABDELFATAH: The economy boomed during the Industrial Revolution, and so did the wealth gap. And that... LEPORE: Will require a wholly new way of imagining the act of voting. ABDELFATAH: Because the people in power weren't only watching over their employees at work; they were watching them at the polls. LEPORE: Like, let's say I own a factory, and you are my employee. And we both go to vote, and I want to vote for this guy who's going to reduce taxes on factory owners. Well, I employ you. And I'm going to say to you, you got to vote the way I vote or I'm going to - you're - going to fire you, right? What are you going to do? You're obviously going to vote the way I tell you to vote 'cause I'm going to watch you vote. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARABLOUEI: Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, a movement had been growing to make voting a more private affair. ABDELFATAH: In 1856, the Australian ballot - aka, the secret ballot - became law in Australia. Soon after, England jumped on board, and Parliament passed the Australian ballot, too. Americans start to catch on, state by state. In 1888, Massachusetts became the first to adopt the secret ballot. LEPORE: And one of the ways that you can think about the reform is that it's both what we would call a progressive-minded reform in that it is ensuring the fairness of elections and the ability of all people to participate politically, but it's also quite a reactionary reform. ARABLOUEI: Meaning that even though there wasn't public pressure at the polls anymore, people in power still found ways to suppress voters. LEPORE: If you think about that act of getting a printed ballot, which has all the different party nominees on the ballot, and then going into a booth to vote privately and secretly, without being able to talk to anybody else, you have to be able to read. So the secret ballot is adopted in a place like Massachusetts in order to disenfranchise the truly poor, who can't read. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARABLOUEI: And the thing is, this wasn't just happening in Northern industrial states. CAROL ANDERSON: So Mississippi in 1890, poor African American men and poor whites were actually beginning to join together politically because the robber barons were taking them to the cleaners. ABDELFATAH: This is Dr. Carol Anderson, a professor, historian and author of many books, including her latest, \"One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy.\" ANDERSON: And so the Legislature, the power in Mississippi, looked up and said, Lord, we got to stop this thing. So they talked about cleaning up the election, removing corruption from the ballot box, ensuring the integrity of our elections. But what it did was it removed African Americans by using the legacies of slavery - like poverty, like illiteracy - as the means to block African Americans from the ballot box. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARABLOUEI: A reform meant to protect those with the least amount of power was used by those in power to keep folks out of politics altogether. ABDELFATAH: And this overall shift that we see in the process of voting, from a rowdy public spectacle to a private affair, has a big symbolic impact, too. ARABLOUEI: When you're all alone in that little booth, it can be hard to remember who you're voting for - not in terms of remembering a candidate's name or how to spell it, but actually remembering who your vote is for. LEPORE: Secret voting has an unintended consequence, which is that it gives you the idea that your vote is just something private unto yourself, as opposed to a public commitment and a public statement that you make as a citizen. ANDERSON: When you have a stronger collective good, the society itself is stronger. When it's all about me and I got mine and the hell with you (laughter), when you have a society that is riven with that, you have things that really don't work.

What exactly did Abbie Welch put in her purse before she snuck out of a Walmart in Knoxville, Tenn.? The court ruling doesn't say. Nor does it matter. What matters is a piece of paper she'd previously received from Walmart banning her from the store. Prosecutors used it to argue she was trespassing when she shoplifted. Her crime, typically a misdemeanor, was elevated to a burglary. She became a felon with a six-year sentence. Among the legal briefs cited by the Tennessee Supreme Court in this high-profile ruling in February is one from several retail groups \u2014 in support of the prosecution. Retailers have long kept a close eye on shoplifting laws around the country, warning of organized retail crime rings that are costing stores a lot of money. In an era of social-justice reckoning, their support of harsher shoplifting punishments and related laws faces new scrutiny from advocates who say this lobbying goes counter to the companies' public statements promoting racial and social equity. A new report by the consumer-interest nonprofit Public Citizen calls out major retailers \u2014 Best Buy, Lowe's, Home Depot, Target, Walmart and others \u2014 for donating to trade associations and campaigns promoting harsher shoplifting penalties in at least 18 states. The retailers succeeded in 11 of them, according to the report. \"Corporations that embraced criminal justice reform rhetoric have been fueling mass incarceration,\" the report declares. Racial justice organization Color of Change plans to join Public Citizen in writing to top retailers and industry groups to demand they reverse course. One related measure is on the November ballot in California: Proposition 20 would toughen penalties for some theft-related crimes. Among its biggest backers is grocer Albertsons, parent of Safeway. Costco had previously donated to a campaign in favor but told NPR that the company has requested a return of its contribution and does not support the measure, without elaborating further. \"People from across the political spectrum have come to realize that it's wasteful and ineffective to just ratchet up penalties,\" said Rick Claypool of Public Citizen, who authored the report. \"I think there is an opportunity here for the retailers to change.\" The crime Claypool is typically a corporate-crime watchdog, but it was the Tennessee case that got him curious. The door he opened was to a convoluted web of state laws that decide the fate of people caught shoplifting \u2014 who gets harsher penalties and who doesn't \u2014 and the role that the stores can play when they lobby lawmakers or send security staff to testify in court. The retailers' targets are organized crime rings and repeat offenders, looking to profit from shoplifting, said Jason Straczewski, who oversees state-level advocacy and government relations at the National Retail Federation. \"Retailers are not about filling the jails with tons of people who've stolen small-dollar amounts of goods,\" he said. The definition of \"organized retail theft\" changes by state. California's Prop 20, for example, describes it as at least two people shoplifting \"in concert\" at least twice in six months for a total value more than $250. The National Retail Federation doesn't \"know where to draw the line\" in defining organized retail crime, Straczewski said. But the trade group has called its impact as \"considerable,\" costing retailers $703,320 per $1 billion in sales. Almost all the retailers polled by the trade group said they'd been hit by retail-theft \"gangs\" in the previous year. Top stolen items were designer clothes and handbags, infant formula, razors and laundry detergent. The culprit Home Depot made headlines last year when it said the nation's opioid epidemic was a big cause of \"shrink\" \u2014 a word retailers use when merchandise goes missing, whether stolen by employees or outsiders. Public defenders tend to describe shoplifting cases as crimes of poverty, drug abuse and mental illness. Thalia Karny had just moved from the Bronx to the \u00fcber-wealthy Manhattan as a public defender when she met Qulon McCain. He'd been caught stealing socks from Bloomingdale's, and like Welch in Tennessee faced a bumped-up felony charge because the store had given him a \"trespass notice.\" McCain told her he was homeless. That he had mental illness. That he wanted to get better. He spent almost nine months in prison, she says, before finding a place in a mental-health treatment center. Karny had never seen such a case before. But they've cropped up in some states. A woman battling cancer was sentenced to at least 10 months in prison in Pennsylvania after stealing some $100 worth of groceries. A man in Tennessee was sentenced to 12 years in prison after he faked the return of $39 worth of items he had taken off store shelves. A man in Arizona was charged with a felony after getting caught stealing items worth less than $10. Prosecutors point to the offenders' lengthy criminal histories as factors for their serious sentences. Public defenders say they are people trapped in the cycle of the criminal justice system. \"Shoplifting may be a problem, an issue that needs to be dealt with, but in our society, the only answer we have apparently is \u2014 let's put people in prison for long periods of time,\" said Jonathan Harwell, a public defender in Tennessee known for his work on \"Walmart burglary\" cases. \"We're the only country in the world that does it on the scale that we do it. It doesn't seem to be working, and it ruins people's lives. And why are we doing that?\" The punishment The main way that retailers are pushing for harsher shoplifting punishments, according to Public Citizen, has to do with the dollar value that states use to determine whether an incident is a felony (typically punishable by over a year in prison) or a misdemeanor (typically punishable by less than a year in jail, often served on probation). In recent years, concerns about mass incarceration have pushed most states to raise the felony threshold. Many say, for example, that theft below $1,000 should be a misdemeanor. But disputes around these amounts persist. Retail trade groups have argued that prosecutors should be able to aggregate shoplifting incidents to crack down on repeat offenders. With the same goal, the groups in many states have lobbied in favor of lower thresholds for the value of stolen property that triggers a felony charge. Opponents of higher felony thresholds argue they encourage more shoplifting because organized groups can simply adjust to stealing more valuable items without fear of facing stiffer charges. In recent years, the Pew Charitable Trusts studied states that raised their thresholds and reported that property crime rates were falling before the change and continued to fall afterward. The National Retail Federation's 2020 security survey found that shoplifting apprehensions and prosecutions have fallen dramatically since 2015. Meanwhile, the average loss per each shoplifting incident declined only slightly to $270. According to the Insurance Information Institute, most insurance policies do not cover shoplifting but can cover burglaries. Something major is getting lost in all of this, says Pew's Jake Horowitz. If the goal is to deter crime, tougher punishment is actually not the best approach. \"This may surprise some folks, but it's one of the least controversial ideas among people who study crime,\" Horowitz says. More severe punishments are  expensive, costing taxpayers, but he says severity is \"essentially meaningless\" compared with the most important factor: certainty of punishment. \"Research shows clearly that the chance of being caught is a vastly more effective deterrent than even draconian punishment,\" says the National Institute of Justice, an agency of the U.S. Justice Department. \"Prison sentences (particularly long sentences) are unlikely to deter future crime. Prisons actually may have the opposite effect.\" Editor's Note: Target and Walmart are among NPR's recent financial supporters. NPR's Will Chase contributed to this report.",

He's the author of The Broken Ladder: How Inequality Affects the Way We Think, Live, and Die. He says it's human nature to compare ourselves to others. But that instinct can cause psychological stress. \"We think about ourselves in terms of being on a certain rung with some people above us, and other people below us. Where we think we stand on that ladder tells you a lot about a person's life and their life outcomes.\" This week on Hidden Brain, we explore the psychology of inequality.

Gavin Newsom said his state budget will include more than $1 billion directed toward homelessness in response to a growing crisis on the streets on California's major cities.\n                \n                    \n                    Frederic J. Brown /AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tents line a street in Los Angeles on Jan. 8. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said his state budget will include more than $1 billion directed toward homelessness in response to a growing crisis on the streets on California's major cities. Gov. Gavin Newsom made homelessness the focus of his State of the State address Wednesday, reflecting not only Californians' top concern but also nearly 20 years of wrangling on an issue that has followed him from San Francisco City Hall to the Capitol in Sacramento. \"No amount of progress can camouflage the most pernicious crisis in our midst,\" Newsom said, \"the ultimate manifestation of poverty: homelessness.\" A recent statewide poll showed homelessness and housing are top of mind for likely California voters ahead of the state's March 3 primary election. About 42% of those surveyed said they see many tents and encampments in the public places and streets where they live. In his address, Newsom called for new and ongoing revenue sources to pay for homeless services and new housing. He warned that cities and counties would be held accountable to ensure they spend state health care dollars on homeless people with mental illnesses. Social services advocate Jennifer Friedenbach with the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness said she's thrilled Newsom is taking the issue seriously but that the state must focus deeply on investment or else these will only be temporary fixes. \"Folks with severe mental health issues that are out on the streets are victims of a system,\" she said. \"They feel that the system is resistant to helping them.\" As a San Francisco supervisor in 2002, Newsom drew national attention with his \"Care Not Cash\" ballot initiative that diverted public assistance from homeless residents to pay landlords for shelter, instead. The program rankled advocates and challenged the city's status as a progressive stronghold. It also helped get him elected mayor. Seventeen years later, Newsom has again made homelessness one of his top priorities as the number of people experiencing homelessness in California grew to more than 151,000. While some people who followed Newsom's early career are optimistic about his willingness to attach his name to such a thorny issue \u2014 going so far as to say he'll \"own homelessness\" in California, a state with more than a quarter of the nation's unhoused people \u2014 others aren't sure he'll focus on the kind of solutions needed. \"Care Not Cash\" When Care Not Cash went to the ballot in 2002, homelessness had reached peak levels. There were 8,640 residents without homes on a given night in San Francisco, according to a biennial survey for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. That's about 8% more than the 8,011 homeless residents counted during the same survey in 2019. At the start of the decade, dot-com companies were swarming San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, while elsewhere in the city, rents rose and evictions spiked. The average two-bedroom apartment in 2001 was going for about $3,500 in today's dollars, according to a 2002 report. A majority of progressive politicians, many without prior political experience, had swept the Board of Supervisors in 2000 \u2014 a citizen revolt to the pro-development Mayor Willie Brown, said Richard DeLeon, professor emeritus of political science at San Francisco State University. Newsom was seen then as somewhat of a pariah, DeLeon said, a centrist who had been hand-picked by Brown to fill a midterm vacancy on the board in 1997. Then the dot-com bubble burst and office spaces in the city's South of Market neighborhood started becoming vacant. Care Not Cash, Newsom's signature issue, became a test of the city's values. Newsom and other city officials claimed out-of-towners were coming into San Francisco to get public assistance checks. And those that were here were likely using that money for drugs and alcohol. In one television ad for Care Not Cash, a series of disheveled men speak directly into the camera. \"I take your cash, and I buy drugs,\" the commercial begins, \"crack, heroin, alcohol.\" \"That was pretty harmful to public sentiment around supporting real solutions,\" said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness. Voters sided with Newsom, and the measure won with 60% approval approval. It was the boost Newsom needed to launch his mayoral campaign a few months later, DeLeon said. \"It put him on the map, politically,\" DeLeon said. \"It certainly put a spotlight on him.\" Trent Rhorer, who has served as the executive director of San Francisco's Human Services Agency since 2000 and oversaw the implementation of Care Not Cash, remembers a young supervisor and later mayor who seemed to genuinely care about the plight of homeless residents. Rhorer received so many requests for information from Supervisor Newsom that he set up weekly meetings. Reports that Rhorer gave him would return dog-eared and highlighted. \"We would have these two-hour sessions ... and the meetings would just go on and on and on,\" Rhorer recalled. \"When he left the office, [Newsom] knew more about homelessness than I did, honestly.\" Care Not Cash officially launched in May 2004, reducing the amount of money homeless residents received from a maximum of $410 per month to $59. In exchange, program enrollees got food and a guaranteed bed at a shelter or in a single-room occupancy hotel. When the city updated its homeless survey in 2005, it saw a 28% reduction in the number of homeless people compared to 2002. Friedenbach believes it's unlikely Care Not Cash contributed to that reduction since the program didn't create any new housing. Newsom's predecessor, Mayor Brown, approved thousands of new affordable housing units, which Friedenbach said had just finished construction around that time and probably made more of a difference. But Rhorer says ending homelessness was never the goal. \"It was about welfare reform,\" Rhorer said. And in that way, it worked. Once Care Not Cash began in the spring of 2004, the city immediately saw a reduction in the number of homeless people claiming benefits. In December 2003, there were 2,632 people who received assistance, which dropped to 642 in December 2007. In Newsom's wake The number of people experiencing homelessness then remained relatively stable during Newsom's tenure until it began to increase again in 2011, right around the time he left to become lieutenant governor, growing from nearly 5,700 people to more than 8,000 in 2019. Whether Newsom's leadership would have helped stem the increase is impossible to know, but Bevan Dufty thinks it would have helped. Dufty, now a BART board director, served on San Francisco's Board of Supervisors with Newsom. He later served as Mayor Ed Lee's head of homeless policy. \"Gavin was mayor during a lot of years when the cupboard was dry,\" when the Great Recession hit, Dufty said. \"I think San Francisco's homeless problem would seem very different because he wouldn't be afraid, if he had had the resources, to put them to use to house people.\" Not much has changed about Care Not Cash since its inception, Rhorer said, except that now, the city uses a more sophisticated screening matrix to prioritize people who are disabled, chronically homeless or have other special needs \u2014 and the amount of public assistance has grown. As mayor, Newsom had also launched an ambitious 10-year plan in 2004 to end chronic homelessness and pledged to build 3,000 new units of supportive housing. By 2014, San Francisco built 2,669 of the units that Newsom pledged as mayor but homelessness still rose \u2014 climbing to 6,775 people by 2015. And it continues to grow. A decade after Newsom left the mayor's office, homelessness is a bigger issue than ever, with solutions seeming more out of reach than ever before. He kicked off the year with a proposal to direct $1.4 billion of the state budget to pay for rent subsidies, board and care homes, health services and affordable housing, and then went on a statewide tour of emergency shelters and mental health care centers. And he started distributing the first two dozen of 100 former FEMA trailers and tents to provide immediate housing for people experiencing homelessness. On Wednesday, Newsom said the state would make available 286 state-owned properties such as vacant lots, fairgrounds, armories and other state buildings for potential shelter options that local governments can use for free. To speed up construction of affordable housing and shelters, Newsom said he would like to bypass state environmental reviews, which are sometimes used to block and delay projects. He also urged the Legislature to reform land use laws to eliminate delays on affordable housing projects around transit hubs and downtown areas. \"I respect local control, but not at the cost of creating a two-class California,\" he said. Friedenbach, a staunch critic of Newsom's tenure in San Francisco, is hopeful. She was pleased to see Newsom's executive order to use surplus state land for emergency shelters and his push to provide significant one-time funds to address homelessness. \"I'm a big believer in redemption,\" she said.",

NOEL KING, HOST: Guatemala gets a new president today. He's a former surgeon, a social conservative. And some analysts doubt whether he can ease the poverty and violence that have led so many people to flee Guatemala. Maria Martin has the story. MARIA MARTIN, BYLINE: The U.S. delegation to the inauguration of President Alejandro Giammattei includes Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. One of the biggest questions is whether Guatemala will support a controversial asylum agreement it signed with the U.S. last July. So far, the new president has sent out mixed signals. But many analysts believe the threat of increased tariffs on Guatemalan exports will force the new president's hand. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT ALEJANDRO GIAMMATTEI: (Speaking Spanish). (APPLAUSE) GIAMMATTEI: (Speaking Spanish). MARTIN: At his victory rally, Giammattei promised to build a new Guatemala, creating peace and progress and ending malnutrition and violence while putting an end to what he called disgusting corruption. Outgoing President Jimmy Morales expelled a U.N.-backed International Anti-Corruption Commission. Giammattei has talked about a national anti-corruption project, but civil society activist Manfredo Marroquin doesn't see much hope for real change under the new administration. MANFREDO MARROQUIN: (Speaking Spanish). MARTIN: Marroquin says, \"Giammattei is in the mold of traditional politicians in Guatemala. He's not proposing specific reforms,\" he says, \"nor guaranteeing he'll make the fight against corruption a priority.\" What Giammattei is making a priority is to stimulate business and investment in Guatemala. He says that will trickle down and put an end to cost of migration. But journalist Juan Luis Font says his proposals may benefit only a small sector of Guatemalan society. JUAN LUIS FONT: Its major plans are shaped to stimulate the formal economy of the country. However, we have to think that 60% of the Guatemalan population lives out of this formal economy. MARTIN: Giammattei has spent the last 13 years running for president under the banner of four different parties. Professor Jo-Marie Burt, a Guatemala expert with the Washington Office on Latin America, questions the alliances he's had to make in the process. JO-MARIE BURT: The hard-line military, for example, he has very close associates among his advisers. And in his proposed Cabinet are former counterinsurgency officials. Some of them participated in an attempted coup in 1993. Some of them have alleged ties with organized crime and drug trafficking. MARTIN: Giammattei won't enjoy a large popular mandate. He received only 14% of the vote in the first-round election. But in the second round, he faced off against a highly disliked former first lady accused of corruption - this after more popular candidates had been barred from running. Giammattei's biggest challenge may be how to deal with a skeptical citizenry, more than a million of whom have felt the need to seek new lives in the United States. For NPR News, I'm Maria Martin.

            "article_content": "Freedom Summer, now streaming on PBS, focuses on the 1964 movement to get Black people to vote in Mississippi. Director Stanley Nelson and organizer Charles Cobb discussed the film in 2014.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. As debates rage about voting access in the November election, we're going to recall another time, more than a half century ago, when securing ballot access could be a life-or-death matter. Right now PBS is streaming the documentary \"Freedom Summer\" about the movement in 1964 to open the polls to African Americans in Mississippi in an era of entrenched segregation. Freedom Summer was organized by SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which recruited 700 college students, mostly white students from the North, to come down to Mississippi and help African Americans register to vote. The organizers, the students and the Black people trying to register were all risking their lives. Just as \"Freedom Summer\" was beginning, two white participants - Mickey Schwerner and Andrew Goodman - and one African American organizer, James Chaney, were murdered by racists. We're going to listen to the interview Terry recorded in 2014 with Charles Cobb, one of the organizers of Freedom Summer, who went on to become a journalist and author, and with the director of the film, Stanley Nelson. He also directed documentaries about the Freedom Riders, Marcus Garvey and the murder of Emmett Till. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) TERRY GROSS: Stanley Nelson, Charles Cobb - welcome to FRESH AIR. Charles Cobb, you were a part of Freedom Summer. What was the idea behind Freedom Summer? CHARLES COBB: To bring the country's attention on Mississippi. We had been working in the state for two to three years pretty much full time, meaning those of us with SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality. And we decided to bring the country's children to Mississippi. And... GROSS: And when you say the country's children, you mean college students. COBB: Yeah, the country students. We knew the people who would be coming would be mostly white and that the country would be concerned. GROSS: Because there were white, middle-class students there, the press... COBB: And danger. GROSS: ...The press would be paying attention. COBB: Yeah. GROSS: Government officials would be paying attention. COBB: Would be paying attention. GROSS: 1964 is the summer of Freedom Summer in Mississippi. It's also the summer - July 2, to be precise - that President Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act into law. So that begins the official desegregation of the South. Why was the emphasis in Mississippi's Freedom Summer on voter registration as opposed to desegregation? I mean, this was the era of lunch counter sit-ins, of other movements to try to desegregate the South. COBB: Most of the civil rights leadership in the South had come to the decision, even long before we even got involved in a place like Mississippi, that voter registration was the most important thing to do. In a state like Mississippi that's primarily rural - weren't that many places to desegregate, unless you're talking about a gas station bathroom. Voter registration was the consensus that existed in the Black South about what was important to do. And that was taking place not just in Mississippi but in Louisiana and other parts of the South. GROSS: Stanley Nelson, your film points out that, within SNCC, this idea of bringing down white, middle-class students from the North to help lead voter registration drives in Mississippi was actually controversial. It was controversial within SNCC. And, Charles Cobb, in fact, early on you opposed the idea of Freedom Summer. COBB: Yes. GROSS: You opposed bringing down white students from the North. What was the problem that you and some other members of SNCC had with this idea? COBB: I think the - our objection or opposition to the summer project unfortunately has been racialized more than it should be. We were fundamentally opposed to bringing a large number of college students from the outside into Mississippi essentially because we felt that we had been spending the last two or three years trying to cultivate grass roots that were still very fragile and that this large number of students would essentially trample on those grass roots. They could do things more efficiently, and while that's good in one sense, it also takes possession of the movement away from the local people in another sense. We were organizers, not leaders, and our main concern was cultivating local leadership. And we were nervous about what it would mean to have a thousand Northern college students. And we were talking around that number of a thousand right from the beginning - come down South. GROSS: Funny thing is, you were from the outside, too. You weren't from Mississippi; you were from Massachusetts (laughter). COBB: Exactly. Mrs. Hamer - when I voiced objection, Mrs. Hamer - Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer... GROSS: Fannie Lou Hamer, yeah. COBB: ...Backed me up against the wall and said, well, Charlie, I'm glad you came down here. What's the problem with other people coming down here? Now, what can I say to that? Well, nothing. GROSS: So... COBB: So I said, yes, ma'am. (LAUGHTER) COBB: And let it go. What meant was, obviously, that I might have objections to the summer project, but I wasn't going to fight Mrs. Hamer over this or any - all the people who opposed the summer project were organizers. All - every single local person - and I mean every single local person we worked with - was for the summer project. And we weren't going to fight the local people. You can't organize people and say, you have a right to take control of your life, and then turn around and say, well, I don't like your decisions, so I'm not going to work with you. GROSS: And you mentioned Fannie Lou Hamer as being the person who changed your mind. Stanley Nelson, what is Fannie Lou Hamer's importance in Mississippi's Freedom Summer? STANLEY NELSON: Well, I mean, Fannie Lou Hamer was essential. I think one of the reasons why she was essential was, you know, she had been a sharecropper, and she was a Mississippian. And, you know, she - as Bob Moses says in the film, you know, she had Mississippi in her bones. That's who she was. And so besides, you know, being a great speaker, a great leader, a great singer, she was also one of them, you know, one of the local people. They saw one of their own. She had lived the consequences of trying to vote. You know, she goes to register to vote and is kicked off her property and loses her livelihood just for the sheer act of trying to register to vote. GROSS: Stanley Nelson, can you talk about how SNCC recruited students from the North? NELSON: Yeah, I think that, you know, very early it was decided that - to bring down 700 to 1,000 students, and they went about recruiting in different ways, mainly from - as my understanding, from college campuses. So one person in the film, a woman, you know, said she just saw a poster up on - at her college campus and then went to a meeting and signed up. One of the things that we show in the film - we found this great footage of, actually, you know, them - SNCC and CORE doing interviews. And so people had to go through an interview process because they really understood that this was going to be dangerous. And they had to get a core group of people to go down who also understood that this was going to be dangerous. You know, I think somebody says in the film they didn't want a bunch of kooks, you know, down there who were going down there to try to save the world; they wanted people who could, as best as possible, you know, understand the dangers and understand what was going to go on down there in Mississippi. GROSS: So there were training sessions held for the students who were going to go to Mississippi. Give us a sense of what the training sessions are like. What advice did the SNCC organizers have for how to deal with danger? COBB: Well, mainly, we could show people how best to try and protect yourself from actual physical - what to do if you're attacked by a mob, how to cover your body, how to protect somebody you're with without, you know, engaging in fistfights or whipping out a pistol or something like that. We could show people how to do that. We had some experience in that because we all came out of the sit-in movement and were used to being surrounded by mobs of hostile whites. We could also tell people how to move in communities. And a particular concern to us was if these volunteers would move in a community in such a way as to endanger local people. Like a Black guy - because this happened on my project - a Black guy and a white girl holding hands walking down the streets of the town not only endangers them but endangers the community. So we could teach people how to do that. GROSS: Or how to not do that. (LAUGHTER) COBB: Or how to not do that, yeah. How to not do that, yes. NELSON: Yeah, there was actually - I mean, it was so dangerous that there was actually a list of some do's and don'ts that I found to be... COBB: Yeah. NELSON: ...You know, really fascinating, you know? Don't stand - you know, at night, don't stand with your back at the door of a house with the lights on, you know? Don't let people pass you on the highway - those kind of things, you know, which for me, as a filmmaker, showed, you know, visually, the danger that was there. DAVIES: If you're just joining us, we're talking about the 1964 struggle to achieve voting rights for Black citizens in Mississippi. It's the subject of the documentary \"Freedom Summer,\" directed by our guest Stanley Nelson. It's now streaming on the PBS website - pbs.org. Our other guest, Charles Cobb, was one of the organizers who led the effort. We'll get back to their conversation with Terry Gross after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MARVIN GAYE SONG, \"INNER CITY BLUES (MAKE ME WANNA HOLLER)\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. We're listening back to an interview from our archives about the Mississippi Freedom Summer, the drive to support voting rights in Mississippi during the summer of 1964. SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, brought 700 students from the North, mostly white students, to Mississippi to help register people to vote, but also to focus the attention of the nation on the violent racism in the South. That effort is the subject of the 2014 public television documentary \"Freedom Summer,\" which is streaming on the PBS website. Our guests are the filmmaker Stanley Nelson and Charles Cobb, who was one of the organizers of Freedom Summer. They spoke with Terry in 2014, when the film came out. It was the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: During the training sessions, three of the people associated with Freedom Summer were murdered - Mickey Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, two white Northerners, and James Chaney, who was African American and a member of CORE, the Congress on Racial Equality. Stanley, do you want to tell the story of what happened to them - of who they were and what happened? NELSON: Yeah. Mickey Schwerner had been in Mississippi for months before as an organizer. James Chaney was a local African American Mississippian who was also a part of CORE and an organizer. They had gone up to Oxford, Ohio, to the training and there met Andrew Goodman. A church was bombed in Mississippi, and they decided - James Chaney and Mickey Schwerner decided to go down early and to see what happened because that was in the area they were working. Andrew Goodman went with them because he was going to be working in that area. And this was, I think, a day before the rest of the group was going to go down to Mississippi. So this was really even before the actual Freedom Summer had started. And they went down, and the day after they went down there, they disappeared. GROSS: And then, eventually, their bodies were discovered. And, Charles Cobb, can you tell us the effect that that had on the plans for Freedom Summer? I mean, before it had actually really begun, three people are murdered - just an example of the violence, the hatred and the danger that faced all the people who planned on going to Mississippi. COBB: Well, you know, it affected the volunteers more than us. As soon as we heard - and we were all in Oxford, Miss., that Mickey and \"Jimmy\" James Chaney and Andrew Goodman were missing. We assumed they were dead because Mickey Schwerner and James Chaney were experienced organizers. They would not have been silent for that long a period of time unless they were prevented from getting in contact. So we assumed they were dead. And the volunteers picked up on this right away, and we had conversations with them about - I mean, sadly - I mean, it was an example of what we had really been talking to the volunteers about before the three were missing, that you are going into a murderously violent state, and you have to understand that the danger affects you every day, all day long. The missing workers drove that point home because we were quite frank telling the volunteers, we think they are dead. And that, for lack of a better word or phrase, sobered up those volunteers. And it also had an effect on the project because, as you might expect, it alarmed their parents. And their parents began calling the congressman and began calling, if they could, the White House and say, you better make sure that our kids get out of Mississippi alive. GROSS: So once everybody gets to the South, everybody from Freedom Summer, the white students move into the homes of African Americans. They're living in the Black community there. It's the only safe place for them. But they're exposed to a way of life and a kind of poverty, in many cases, that they'd never seen before. Stanley Nelson, you interviewed a lot of the students who had come - a lot of the people who were students in 1964 and came down for Freedom Summer. Tell us a little bit about what they were exposed to that opened up their eyes about what life was like for African Americans in Mississippi, in rural Mississippi. NELSON: Right. You know, as you said, there was no place else for them to stay. I mean, you know, there were no hotels. They couldn't stay in a hotel. They really had to stay with the African American community and live as the African American community lived. But I think one of the things that was so striking about the way they lived is, you know, they couldn't go back to the white community. It wasn't like, OK, we're just staying - you know, we're staying at some Black people's houses, and, you know, now we can be white people again. You know, they were in a series of mostly small towns. Everybody knew who they were and why they were there. They were looked at in the same way as African Americans or worse. You know, they couldn't just bop downtown and go to a white bar for the night and do that. No, they were in constant danger, constant scorn, ridicule and faced, you know, real physical dangers, too. But I think, also, it's a psychological piece of, you know, something that's very rare for white folks in this country to experience, to be part of an African American community and not be able to get out of it when they want to. GROSS: Do you think that this was a revelation to some Black people in Mississippi that not all white people were racist? COBB: Yes, I think so. NELSON: I think - yeah, I think for so many Black people in the community, as they say in the film, this was the first time they were exposed to white people who had kind of come to help them and who were not racist and who had very different opinions. So it was a revelation, I think, to many of the Black people in the community. And for some, especially for some of the younger people, it was a life-changing experience. GROSS: So we know - we talked a little bit about how the white students were trained about what to expect, what not to do, how to defend themselves in Mississippi. At the same time, the white authorities in Mississippi, they were gearing up for Mississippi summer. What did they do? NELSON: When the white community heard that this Freedom Summer was going to happen, I think in some ways they overreacted completely. In Jackson, Miss., the city bought a tank that they armed. You know, they increased the jail capacity. They were really ready for riots, and they wanted to portray it that way, as that - you know, these people were going to come down and make trouble and cause riots and really disrupt their way of life. So that's how they looked at it. Also, you know, the Klu Klux Klan - which had kind of been silent for a long time in Mississippi - starts to rise again. You know, in Mississippi, there was a thing called the Citizen's Council, which somebody described as the uptown Ku Klux Klan, that was made up of businessmen. And, you know, in some ways, the Citizens' Council had convinced Mississippians, well, you don't really need the Klan; you know, you've got us. We've got the police. We've got all these things in place that will hold Black people back and make sure that Black people don't get rights and don't get the right to vote. When Freedom Summer started, I think that then the Klan starts to take a bigger role in Mississippi than it had before. GROSS: So, you know, one of the goals of Mississippi Freedom Summer was to register African American people to vote. But it was hard to do. People were afraid. What were some of the things they were afraid of if they actually registered to vote? COBB: Well, they were afraid of getting killed. They were afraid of economic reprisal or even being run out of their counties or towns. They were afraid of, if they did register - make an attempt to register to vote, they were afraid of reprisal being directed at family members, relatives, friends. So there were a range of fears around voter registration, which kept the registered numbers very, very low, even during the summer in Mississippi, which is what led to the creation of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and a whole chain of events. DAVIES: Our guests are Stanley Nelson and Charles Cobb speaking in 2014 with Terry Gross. Nelson directed the documentary \"Freedom Summer,\" which is now available for streaming on PBS. Cobb was the field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Organizing Committee in Mississippi during the 1964 drive for voting rights. Here's a recording led by one of Freedom Summer's most famous organizers, Fannie Lou Hamer. It was recorded in Greenwood, Miss., in 1963, one year before Freedom Summer. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Singing) Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills and everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain to let my people go. All right. Paul and Silas bound in chains. Let my people go. Had nobody for the gold out there. Let my people go. Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills and everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain to let my people go. Paul and Silas began to shout, let my people go. Jail opened, and they walked out. Let my people go. Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills and everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain to let my people go. Who's that yonder dressed in red? Let my people go. Must be the children that Moses led. Let my people go. Go tell it... DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. Let's get back to Terry's 2014 interview about Freedom Summer, a movement in 1964 to open the polls to African Americans in Mississippi. Freedom Summer was organized by SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which brought down about 700 students - mostly white students - from the North to help register African Americans to vote. Racism was so institutionalized in Mississippi that it was dangerous for Black people to register. The presence of the white students helped focus national attention on what African Americans were facing. Terry spoke to Charles Cobb, one of the organizers of Freedom Summer, and with Stanley Nelson, who directed a documentary about Freedom Summer now streaming on pbs.org. Nelson explained how Freedom Summer led to the formation of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) NELSON: 1964 was a presidential election year, and Lyndon Johnson would be nominated for the presidency in Atlantic City. So the idea of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party was to take an alternate delegation to the convention in Atlantic City and try to obtain the right to be seated as opposed to the regular delegation from Mississippi. The regular delegation from Mississippi was all white. There was no way an African American person could become part of that delegation, and that was against the rules of the Democratic National Convention. So the idea was we will take our own delegation, which is integrated. And we'll take that and get a hearing at the Democratic National Convention and be seated as the delegation from Mississippi instead of what was called the regular delegation, the all-white delegation. GROSS: Charles Cobb, did the members of SNCC who organized Mississippi Freedom Summer think that the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party would actually be seated at the Democratic convention and be allowed to replace the official Mississippi delegation? Did you see it as a more symbolic action, or did you think, you know, we have a chance in the real world of politics this might actually happen? COBB: I think most of the delegation felt they would be seated, and many in SNCC and CORE felt the delegation would be seated. Our lawyer Joe Rauh, famous Democratic Party lawyer, was encouraging on this point. If you can get the story out, you will be seated. And I think the delegation would have been seated except that Lyndon Johnson pulled all his political levers ruthlessly to force sympathetic Democrats from the North and from the West in particular to back away from the MFDP. NELSON: Let me add something about the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and the convention. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party got what it wanted at the convention. It got its hearing at the convention, and it had an incredible lineup, which was televised from the convention. So Martin Luther King spoke in favor of the Mississippi Democratic Party. Rita Schwerner, whose husband had recently been killed, spoke. And Fannie Lou Hamer was kind of like the cleanup hitter. She was the final speaker who spoke eloquently about what it meant to be an African American Mississippian and denied her rights. And they really won the day. I mean, they had won. They had swayed the convention to their side until Lyndon Johnson stepped in. GROSS: What did President Johnson do to prevent - to try to prevent the Mississippi delegation from being seated at the convention? COBB: He threatened people. He said, you know, you want to be a judge? Not if you support the MFDP. He used Hubert Humphrey as his hatchet man, in fact, dangling the vice presidency over Hubert Humphrey's head, saying, you want to be vice president, the vice presidential candidate? You help me squash this challenge by the Mississippi Democratic Party. He used the labor unions. Walter Reuther told Martin Luther King, if you back the MFDP, don't look for any more money from us. To Martin Luther King's credit, he never backed away from the MFDP. This is a political ruthlessness that's not unusual in American politics. You've seen it with Tammany Hall politicians, you saw it with the Dick Daley political machine, and you've seen it in Boston and other places. It's that kind of political ruthlessness that was brought to bear at the 1964 Democratic Party national convention to make sure that that MFDP Freedom Democratic Party delegation didn't get seated. GROSS: What is your understanding of why LBJ didn't want the alternate delegation seated? He had already signed the Civil Rights Act. He worked really hard to get that passed. So what was his fear? NELSON: Well, I think, you know, LBJ was a complicated man. You know, he wanted the Democratic National Convention to be kind of a coronation, you know, of him and for it to go very, very smoothly. From all indications, he was really paranoid that, you know, Bobby Kennedy had a plan and that any disruption in the convention would then allow Bobby Kennedy to enact his plan. And his plan then would be to kind of seize the momentum and somehow place himself in position to get the nomination for the presidency of the United States. It's ridiculous, but from multiple sources that we interviewed in the film, that was part of Johnson's thinking. GROSS: So a compromise was reached. What was the compromise? NELSON: I don't think a compromise was ever really reached. And, Charlie, you should probably speak on that. GROSS: A compromise was proposed. I'll put it that way. COBB: No, it wasn't proposed. GROSS: It wasn't proposed? COBB: It was announced. GROSS: It was announced. Oh, OK. COBB: It was announced. GROSS: OK. COBB: Bob Moses; Fannie Lou Hamer; Ed King, who was a member of the delegation; Aaron Henry, who was the head of the delegation; several other people were in conversation in Hubert Humphrey's hotel suite about a compromise. Edith Green, who was a congresswoman from Oregon, had put a very serious proposal on the table, saying that each delegation would be asked to swear loyalty to the Democratic Party and to the presidential nominee that emerged out of the convention. And delegates who swore that would be seated both from the MFDP and the all-white because the Mississippi delegation had come to Atlantic City, the Democratic Party National Convention having announced their support for Barry Goldwater, precisely because - and that's one of the aftermaths of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. What happened during this meeting was somebody knocked on the door and said, turn on the television and look. And there was Walter Mondale announcing a compromise. Now, that compromise had not been discussed with the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, and the compromise he announced was that the Democratic Party was prepared to seat two Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates as honorary delegates. And then they proceeded to name who those delegates would be - Fannie Lou Hamer and Edwin King, and they would be given some kind of special status at the convention. Well, what irritated the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party people was that, one, they presumed to name who the two delegates would be and, B, that they had announced this compromise without discussion. NELSON: Yeah, but also, you know, you have to be clear - so the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party would be given two delegates, which - what they were called is kind of at-large delegates. COBB: Yeah. NELSON: And the Mississippi - the regular delegation from Mississippi would retain its 68 delegates. GROSS: You mentioned the fear of Southern Democrats. Was that another reason, do you think, why LBJ was so concerned about the Mississippi alternate delegation? COBB: Well, he was concerned - and this had been a continuing concern in his administration, particularly after the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act - that the Democratic Party was losing the Southern Dixiecrats. And remember, as I said, the Mississippi delegation had come to the convention having already announced, Democrats or not, their support for Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential candidate. NELSON: Who was the Republican candidate. COBB: Yeah. NELSON: He was the Republican candidate. COBB: So Johnson - I understand it, you know, from a strictly political sense. I mean, Johnson saw the Democratic Party losing the entire Southern wing of the Democratic Party, and he was right in that 'cause they - he did. The party did lose that entire so-called Dixiecrat wing. GROSS: So the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, the alternate delegation, refused this compromise. So no one from that alternate delegation was seated with the official Mississippi delegation. Charles Cobb, looking back on 1964 and Mississippi Freedom Summer, what do you think the outcomes were? What were the gains? COBB: One important gain was the challenge of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party changed the national Democratic Party. It's out of this challenge that you get what are now known as the McGovern rules, which expanded the participation of women and minorities in the Democratic Party. And I think attitudes were changed in Mississippi. People saw that it was possible, in a wider sense, to struggle against white supremacy, and it changed the attitude of those students who participated in that. Mario Savio, who would shortly lead the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley in California, was a volunteer in Mississippi. So was Barney Frank. I think it changed the attitude of these young people who came South. And it's interesting to note in passing that a number of them have stayed in touch with these communities that they worked in in 1964. GROSS: The following year, 1965, Congress passes - President Johnson signs the Voting Rights Act. Do you see a direct connection between the passage of the Voting Rights Act and Mississippi Freedom Summer? COBB: Yes. With Dixiecrats fleeing the Democratic Party, the obvious way to go would be to take advantage of the potential - Black voting potential that existed in the South. I think the Democratic Party and Lyndon Johnson, specifically, recognized the reality that their old world of Dixiecrat power was gone. GROSS: So you see the Voting Rights Act as being realpolitik in a way, like a practical thing. COBB: Yes, yes. DAVIES: Our guests are Charles Cobb, one of the organizers of Freedom Summer, and Stanley Nelson, who directed the 2014 documentary \"Freedom Summer,\" which is available for viewing on the PBS website - pbs.org. We'll hear more of their conversation after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, we're talking about the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964, when 700 college students from the North came to Mississippi to organize for voter registration rights. Our guests are Stanley Nelson, whose 2014 documentary \"Freedom Summer\" is now streaming on the PBS website, and Charles Cobb, one of the organizers. Terry Gross interviewed them in 2014. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: What did the Voting Rights Act, which was passed in 1965, do to help African Americans actually get the right to vote in the South? COBB: Well, it dramatically expanded the number of voters. The place I'm tempted to point at - out is not Mississippi but Lowndes County, Ala., which had no Black registered voters at the beginning of 1965, and Black voters formed a majority of the voting population at the end of 1965. Something similar was unfolding in - really changed the political face - in Neshoba County, Miss., which we've been talking about. Philadelphia, Miss., has a Black mayor who's serving his second term now. Jackson, Miss., where Allen Thompson came up with Thompson's Tank to protect the white citizens of Jackson from these invader - Jackson, Miss., now has a Black mayor. So there's still a lot of issues that have to be dealt with, but you really do have to acknowledge - I think the political face of Mississippi is changed. GROSS: What were the provisions of the Voting Rights Act that changed things? NELSON: One of the things the Voting Rights Act did was put certain areas under federal protection. So in Mississippi, before the Voting Rights Act, less than 10% of African Americans were registered to vote. A year after the Voting Rights Act, it was over 60%, and it's risen since then. So the Voting Rights Act very quickly changed the makeup of the electorate in Mississippi. GROSS: Lyndon Johnson is such an interesting figure in the history of the civil rights movement. And there's a moment I want to play that you use in the film of a conversation that he has with the then-head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. And this is after Rita Schwerner, who was then the widow of Mickey Schwerner, one of the three civil rights workers who were killed in Mississippi early on in Mississippi Freedom Summer, she meets with LBJ. And Stanley Nelson, what does she talk to him about? NELSON: Well, she wants to make sure that the - that there's a real effort to find her husband. At this point, her husband and James Chaney and Andy Goodman are missing, and they've been missing for the whole summer. And so it's really colored everything in that summer. And she wants to make sure that the federal government is doing everything they can to find them because she knows, as everybody else knows down there, that Mississippi, the state government, is doing very, very little. GROSS: And you point out in the film that she was very assertive in asking for this. She says, this isn't a social occasion.; here's what we need to get done. NELSON: Rita Schwerner's an amazing figure. I mean, she - when her husband goes missing, you know, she is in some ways driving this search. But she's also keeping it - the focus on Mississippi and Freedom Summer. You know, she was always saying, I don't want the story of my own suffering and what's happening to me to take over the bigger issues. You know, she constantly says, you know, people have been - have gone missing for a hundred years in Mississippi, and my husband is one of them. I want you to try to find my husband, but I also want protection for the people who are in Mississippi now working. GROSS: So I want to play a phone conversation that's featured in your film between LBJ and FBI head J. Edgar Hoover after LBJ meets with Rita Schwerner. Here's that conversation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LYNDON B JOHNSON: I saw this Ms. Schwerner this evening... J EDGAR HOOVER: Yeah. JOHNSON: ...The wife of the missing boy. HOOVER: Yeah. She's a Communist, you know. JOHNSON: No, but she acted worse than that. HOOVER: Is that so? JOHNSON: Yeah. She was awfully mean and very ugly. And she came in this afternoon. She wants thousands of extra people put down there and said I'm the only one that has the authority to do it. I told her I'd put all that we could efficiently handle, and I was going to let you determine how many we could efficiently handle. GROSS: You know, I think that's very interesting 'cause the first thing that happens is LBJ, after Hoover, you know, calls the Schwerners Communists, LBJ says, no, it's even worse than that. She's rude. She's ugly. And then he says, but I told her, you know, that we'd put down as many people as we can to help out and that you - Hoover - I'd let you decide how many people we could spare. So Charles Cobb, how do you interpret this conversation? COBB: Well, I think Johnson felt that if he did anything, no matter how small, the right attitude should be gratitude. So he was upset with Rita because she didn't come in here saying thank you very much for even paying attention. She said, this is what you got to do, Lyndon Johnson. That's what he didn't like about her approach to him. And that gives you some insight, I think, into how Johnson approached a lot of things beyond race or civil rights. There's nothing in that little clip you played that surprises me. GROSS: I want to thank you both so much for talking with us. COBB: Thank you. NELSON: Thank you so much. DAVIES: Stanley Nelson is the director of the documentary \"Freedom Summer,\" which is streaming on the PBS website, pbs.org. Charles Cobb was a field secretary for SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and one of the organizers of the 1964 voting rights drive. They spoke with Terry Gross in 2014, when the film came out, 50 years after the events in Mississippi. Coming up, our film critic Justin Chang reviews the new film \"Tesla\" - not about the car but about the physicist and inventor that the car is named after. This is FRESH AIR.

            "article_content": "What does it mean to live in a booming economy? In Pueblo, Colo., good manufacturing jobs have turned into low-paying service jobs.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: This is one of more than a dozen states that will vote next week on Super Tuesday. And it's one of the places where we're launching a year-long NPR series called Where Voters Are. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Between now and the election, we will be returning to a handful of communities that reflect the range of people and issues shaping the country today. We will talk to voters about where they are on this election and where they are in the country. And Ari, you have spent the last several days in Pueblo. SHAPIRO: That's right. To get here, you drive about two hours south from Denver. It's wide-open plains stretching for miles, mountains off in the distance. And then, popping up out of the horizon, you see these stark vertical lines - smokestacks. They're the sign that you are approaching Pueblo and the mill that gave this place its nickname, Steel City. But today, only about 6% of Pueblo's jobs are in manufacturing. Old-timers like Rod Slyhoff can trace the change back to one day in 1984. ROD SLYHOFF: For guys like me, it's in my mind all the time. SHAPIRO: He's president and CEO of the Pueblo Chamber of Commerce. SLYHOFF: I believe it was in March. Sixty-five hundred pink slips were issued to the employees, and our economy changed drastically in one day. SHAPIRO: Donald Trump has built his presidency on promises to bring back those kinds of jobs. In fact, just last week, Trump held a rally in Colorado Springs, about 45 minutes up the road from Pueblo. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Remember they said, you can't do manufacturing jobs anymore? Really? Tell me about it. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over one half a century. (CHEERING) SHAPIRO: Those promises sound good to Rod Slyhoff. SLYHOFF: It shows that we have a president that's interested in those - in that industry. So it's that attitude that you've got a leader that is really aware of the value of manufacturing. We're - I think we felt like maybe that hasn't been a priority for previous presidents. SHAPIRO: Here in Pueblo, we found two stories of the economy. As Trump says, unemployment is down. The stock market has been up for the last few years. And from that perspective, things look great. At the same time, working people in Pueblo feel like they can't catch a break. Median income has barely budged here since 2010. Today, the steel mill is owned by a Russian company, and it doesn't have the 24/7 stream of workers that it used to. CHUCK PERKO: This was the main gate to the plant. You had a whole bunch of bars that were right outside. SHAPIRO: Chuck Perko is president of the union that represents some of the workers. The property is two miles wide. He drives us up to the front gate. There's a sign on the visitor center there that says 140 years steel strong. PERKO: Yeah. The mill itself goes back to 1882. SHAPIRO: But it's kind of a fraction of what it once was. PERKO: Yeah. Like I said, it's 10% of the workforce. SHAPIRO: Chuck Perko took us to his union hall, where there's an antique Pepsi machine and an out-of-tune piano. (SOUNDBITE OF PIANO CHORD PLAYING) SHAPIRO: He told me some of his union members went to that Trump rally in Colorado Springs. PERKO: People need that little bit of hope, even if you - it doesn't take much of a delve to realize that what he's saying is not what he intends to do. The message is good, but it's not going to be backed up by anything that is going to be good for your job. SHAPIRO: This area narrowly went for Trump in 2016. Did that surprise you? PERKO: It did. I mean, this has been a labor stronghold going back to the 1930s, when labor came into its own. So it was quite a slap in the face. SHAPIRO: Pueblo has also attracted generations of immigrants. Perko's team at the mill has 20 nationalities. Today, the city is 50% Hispanic. Perko is the fourth generation of his family to work at the mill, and he realizes he's one of the lucky ones. He didn't finish college. He didn't need to. PERKO: One of the things that you see kind of written on a lot of the new hard hats is #millmoney because it's still one of the best-paying jobs for somebody out there that may not necessarily have a college degree. SHAPIRO: Even though the phrase Steel City is all over restaurants and bars in Pueblo, today the city has more people working in retail, education, food service. And a growing number of people are working in newer industries, like clean energy and marijuana. PERKO: When I hear someone say that job at McDonald's is - they don't deserve to make even $12 an hour because they should pick themselves up by their bootstraps and go do something else - those people work harder than I do. I'm - I'll be the first to admit it. And they deserve to be paid for their labor. And so... SHAPIRO: You sound like a Bernie Sanders supporter. PERKO: I am. SHAPIRO: Really? Did I just call that? He used to like Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. PERKO: They're all people that either have a blue-collar background or have at least a plan for the working class. I cannot get behind the parts of the Democratic Party that feel like corporate America. SHAPIRO: When the steel mill laid off thousands of workers in the 1980s, a group of churches got together to open a food pantry. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hi. How are you? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I don't know. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: It's good to see you. The wind didn't blow you away. SHAPIRO: It's called the Cooperative Care Center, and it's still open today, offering bags of food, clothes, medicine, toiletries. But the clients aren't laid-off steelworkers anymore. Mona Montoya has been the director for 27 years. MONA MONTOYA: It's a middle class now that we're - that are hurting. Well, we've seen people from the police department, fire department, schoolteachers, nurses. You close your eyes, and you think of a homeless person. They're families. And there's where it really pains us to see this kind of deal. SHAPIRO: This center helped 38,000 people last year. That's about a quarter of the local population - not surprising since a quarter of the people in Pueblo live at or below the poverty line. A lot of the food at the center is donated by grocery stores. Don Sena has spent his life stocking supermarket shelves on the overnight shift. DON SENA: I've been in the grocery business over 50 years. SHAPIRO: I met him at a blue-collar bar near the steel mill where his father used to work. Sena was pouring a Dos Equis beer into a glass of tomato juice. We stepped outside, and he told me he put his daughter through college. His son is a drill instructor in the Marines. He's about to retire. It's the American dream, but he's not feeling too good about it. SENA: There ain't no jobs in this town anymore. There ain't none. If you have a job, you're lucky. SHAPIRO: Do you think who's president matters to how Pueblo does? SENA: Yeah. I do believe. You know, working-class people are struggling, and these rich people just want to get richer. And they're just taking advantage of the working-class person. SHAPIRO: Are you thinking about that when you cast your vote? SENA: Well, I cast my vote every time. But you know what? I don't think it even matters anymore. SHAPIRO: These struggles are easy to find in Pueblo, but in the last week here, we've also found something else - artists and small businesses starting to take root in the city's empty spaces. In a historic downtown, there are murals everywhere, small breweries making local beer. INA BERNARD: Welcome to Artisan Textile Company. We carry handmade items by local artists. SHAPIRO: Ina Bernard is a textile artist from Germany who opened this shop four years ago in an old part of the city. She sells candles, cards, mittens and paintings, all made by people in the area. Her shop offers classes in scarf knitting and cardmaking. BERNARD: It's just a really fun small community - small-town community, lovely location. The weather is beautiful - lot of sunshine, also, the mountains. But you know, it's nice down here - small-town feel still. SHAPIRO: This town is known as Steel City, and making artisan textiles seems like almost the opposite of manufacturing steel, if there is such a thing. BERNARD: I think Pueblo is very proud to be a steel city town 'cause that's really what helped it build it up. I mean, that's why people came here. But I think now, you know, we love to keep that kind of as our foundation. But you know, I think Pueblo now is kind of looking at maybe growing from that, you know? And definitely, being supportive of the creative economy is definitely one part of that. SHAPIRO: To her, Pueblo's growing artists' community is not a sharp break from the industrial past. She says, just like immigrants a century ago, she moved to Pueblo to be in a place where people make things.

            "article_content": "Hamill, who died Aug. 5, was a columnist and editor at the New York Post and the New York Daily News, covering wars, crime and the people of NYC's boroughs. Originally broadcast in '94, '08 and '11.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Today, we're going into our archive to remember journalist Pete Hamill. He died yesterday at age 85 from complications following emergency surgery after falling and breaking a hip. Hamill was described in The New York Times as the quintessential New York journalist. Times columnist Dan Barry once wrote, if the pavement of New York City could talk, it would sound like Pete Hamill. Hamill traveled the world and covered wars, including Vietnam. He was a columnist for the New York Post and the New York Daily News and served as the top editor at both papers. He was a friend of Robert Kennedy and helped convince him to run for president. On the night Kennedy was shot, Hamill was one of the people who tackled the assassin. His many awards included a Grammy in 1976 for his liner notes for the Dylan album \"Blood On The Tracks\" and a George Polk Career Award in 2014 for his lifetime contributions to journalism. In Hamill's New York Times obituary, Robert McFadden wrote, quote, \"Along with Jimmy Breslin, Hamill popularized a spare, blunt style in columns of on-the-scene reporting in the authentic voice of the working classes. He pounded out stories about murders, strikes, the World Series, championship fights, jazz or politics, and then got drunk after work with buddies in Greenwich Village,\" unquote. The first of the three interviews we'll hear with him was recorded in 1994 after the publication of his memoir \"A Drinking Life,\" in which he wrote about the culture of drink he was once part of and why he gave it up. When we spoke, he hadn't had a drink in 20 years. I asked him if he thought he helped create the myth of the hard-drinking journalist. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PETE HAMILL: I don't think I created that myth, but I certainly inherited it. It was one of the things that I loved about the idea of the newspaperman in the abstract. I had seen all those newspaperman movies when I was a kid. The idea that you could hold your liquor and type a new lead on a breaking story was one of the things that you wore like a badge of honor. So I suppose during the period that I was drinking, I did help keep the myth going (laughter) in my own way. GROSS: What kind of bars were good to hang out at when you were writing a story, and what could you get from being in a bar when you were looking for leads? HAMILL: Well, the best bar to hang out in was one that had a typewriter on the premises. (LAUGHTER) HAMILL: And I was not alone in having written stories actually in the basement of The Lion's Head. I think the best newspapermen bars were not inhabited only by newspapermen but attracted politicians, hustlers of various kinds, actors, ballplayers - you know, a place that had an overlapping system of the categories that a newspaper is made up of. It wasn't just simply cops in the front of the paper, but it was the ballplayers in the back of the paper, the actors in the middle of the paper and the politicians, who, if they were not in handcuffs, were certainly at the bar... GROSS: (Laughter). HAMILL: ...Trying to promote themselves into eternity. GROSS: Let's say you were investigating a murder in a Brooklyn neighborhood. Would you try to go to a bar in that neighborhood and hang out for a while, see what you could find out? HAMILL: Well, almost always. That was the way we operated in those days because New York at that time, and I'm talking the late '50s, early '60s through the end of the '60s, really, when things began to change very quickly - New York at that time was a series of hamlets - connected hamlets. And the bar was still a major institution, along with the church and a political club and probably the police precinct. Bars were institutions in which people revealed themselves most nakedly often, so that if you were looking for information about someone in a story - somebody who had been shot and killed or somebody whose kid had been shot and killed or a family that had been burned out by a fire, whatever the nature of the story - a good neighborhood bar was probably the best source of information. GROSS: How well did you write when you had been drinking? HAMILL: Well, I never wrote while I was drinking. I had a couple of adventures with it early in my career where I tried to drink and then go into the office and do it, and I could not do it. I could - my fingers would smash between the keys and nothing would come out. Drinking with newspapermen, and I think with a lot of other people, too, is often done and most insidiously after work as a kind of reward. You figure, I've really worked at the top of my talent here, as hard as I can, now I'm entitled, you know? And I think that's, in a way, the most debilitating part about it because you continue to say to yourself, I'm not an alcoholic. That guy lying in the gutter with his shoes off - he's an alcoholic, but I work. I get up. I go to the office. I bring home a paycheck, and I feed my kids. But I think there's much more damage done to people's lives, to husbands and wives, to children, to talent, too, to those who work out of a base of talent, by the functioning drunk, the person who can get the work done. And I was very careful. I never drove. I didn't even have a driver's license until after I stopped drinking. And I never drank before I went to work. And that probably prolonged the life longer than I should have. GROSS: So you were the kind of drinker who could say, well, I drink, but I never miss a deadline. HAMILL: Yeah, exactly. I think the most dangerous people - most dangerous myth about all of this is that you have to hit bottom in order to start on your way up. And the people I knew who hit bottom never recovered. They were gone. They had wet brain, or they were dead. They succumbed to all kinds of things that were not directly alcohol-related, not liver diseases, but they died of pneumonia. They died of bad habits, basically. GROSS: So you never bottomed out. HAMILL: No, well, I never bottomed out in the sense that - in the classical sense. I mean, in this book, I wanted to make clear that I was not going to make this worse than it was. It was not about another \"Lost Weekend\" or \"Days Of Wine And Roses\"... GROSS: Yeah. HAMILL: ...In which you got the DTs and you're seeing Richard Nixon in the corner covered with ants. GROSS: (Laughter). HAMILL: If that happened, it happened while I was awake. (LAUGHTER) HAMILL: But I never got to that point. It's a book about getting to a certain point, realizing you're doing a lot of damage, even though you're having a lot of fun along the way, and pulling back and saying, I'm not going to live that life anymore. And it's the life that I'm talking about. You can't separate - with any kind of a problem you have, whether it's drugs or alcohol, you can't separate the dancer from the dance. You can't say, I'm going to solve this problem of alcohol as if it were a pothole disconnected from the rest of things. You have to examine the life that you're leading and the way you got into the habit and into what probably was the destructive part of that habit. GROSS: You're Irish. You grew up in an Irish neighborhood in Brooklyn. Do you think there's any truth in the stereotype of Irish culture as being a drinking culture? HAMILL: Oh, I think there's no doubt that it's - that Irish culture has been bound together for many centuries by drink, but it's not unique to Ireland. I think if you look at defeated nations, if you look at Poland, if you look at the American Indian, if you look at parts of Mexican life in the Southwest, people who have been defeated often are granted the luxury of destroying themselves by the conquerors. And I think Irish drinking came from the conquest of Ireland. It was not unique to the Irish at the time. But if you have no true power, you're granted certain powers by the occupiers most of the time. One of them is drinking. Another thing is machismo. I think machismo is more prevalent under - among defeated people than it is among the winners. So that I think the Irish do share something with those other people that is unique to people having lost franchises. It's being able to confront that and say, will we let these people have a permanent victory? That leads to people saying, that's it; I'm not going to do them the favor of becoming a stage Irishman or a stage Pole or a stage Native American. GROSS: Right. HAMILL: I'm going to live my life, not perform it - not according to their script, at least. GROSS: Your father was a drinker. Your father was from Ireland, moved to Brooklyn, where you were born. But he drank a lot when you were growing up. Did he ever give it up himself? HAMILL: No, he never did. Near the end of his life, in the last five years of his life - he lived to be 80. In the last years of his life - particularly after his hair started getting gray, which was at the age of 75, God bless him - he had trouble with his heart. And they put a pacemaker in, and the doctor forbade him to either drink or smoke cigarettes. He went into the bleakest depression of his life. And so I went to the doctor and said, look - I think the man would rather be dead than to continue to live like this; he is so depressed by all this. And he said, well, tell him he can have two drinks and three cigarettes. My father, being my father, expanded the franchise to five drinks and eight cigarettes... GROSS: (Laughter). HAMILL: ...And lived fairly happily until the day he left us. So no, he did not stop it. He kept drinking, but not - at his age - and he had done, probably, a lot of physical damage. It didn't take much for him to get wrecked. I mean, a few drinks and he would be gone. GROSS: When you started at the Post in 1960, New York had seven papers, which is just impossible to imagine now. Cities that have two papers are in really good shape nowadays. Was it like to have seven papers? HAMILL: It was an absolute feast. And even having the seven papers, we were mourning the fact that we had already lost two or three. We had lost the Brooklyn Eagle - which I used to deliver as a kid, which had a circulation of 300,000 and was just serving the borough of Brooklyn. That was gone. There was a paper called The Bronx Home News that was gone. I think the city was a better city because we had seven newspapers. There were - that meant there were seven different teams of people keeping an eye on the politicians and watching what the cops did and feeding the general sense of debate in the city. For newspapermen, it was an enormous thing because if you didn't have a job, if you didn't like the job you had at the New York Journal-American, you could go down the street and go to work for the Post. Somebody would always hire a good craftsman. So there was a kind of security in the work that is missing now for a lot of people. But more than anything else, it was that you had seven distinct points of view on almost everything in the city that simply has not been replaced by television. GROSS: When you started working at the Post, do you think that the newspaper had a different place in its readers' lives than newspapers have in the lives of readers today? HAMILL: Oh, I think that's - I think, lamentably, that's true because television, although it was strong in 1960 and had been strong for most of a decade - television had not become the all-ruling version of information and entertainment that it's now become. The respect, almost worship, of the printed word that came from the emigrants - for example, if you think that The Daily Forward, which is a Yiddish daily, once had a circulation of 250,000 and that its children were reading the New York Post - the children of those readers were reading the New York Post - you know that you were dealing with generations of people who knew that the words would set them free. They worshipped newspapers. Columnists were the biggest stars in New York, not television people. Television people read news. It was an enormous, amazing period to be young and be alive in a city like New York. GROSS: Pete Hamill, recorded in 1994, after the publication of his memoir \"A Drinking Life.\" He died yesterday at age 85. After we take a short break, we'll hear the interview I recorded with him in 2008 about his friendship with Robert Kennedy and his memories of the night Kennedy was assassinated. Hamill helped tackle the assassin. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. We're remembering journalist Pete Hamill, who died yesterday. The second of the three interviews we'll hear with him today was recorded in 2008, on the 40th anniversary of Robert Kennedy's assassination. Hamill was friends with Kennedy, helped convince him to run for president, worked briefly on his campaign and then wrote about the campaign. Earlier on the night Kennedy was assassinated, he'd won the Democratic primary in California, keeping him in the race. He made his victory speech late that night. Hamill was there. And when the speech was over, Kennedy was shot three times. He died the following day. When we spoke, Hamill had written the introduction to a book of photos of Kennedy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: How did you first get to know Bobby Kennedy? HAMILL: Well, I had gone to cover the war - an early part of the war in Vietnam at the very end of '65. So I was there for Christmas and New Year's and a couple of weeks after that. And this was for the New York Post. Bobby had already been elected senator from New York. But I didn't know him because I was not a political writer. When I got back, there was a note waiting for me from Bobby saying, I loved your pieces from Vietnam. When you're back, please, give me a call. And so I did. It was as simple as that. And I went and met him and liked him very much. When I was a much younger man, I didn't think he was great. Before the assassination of his brother, he had worked for Joe McCarthy and other people in Washington that, as a good, card carrying 25-year-old liberal, I didn't approve of. But when I met him, I understood that he had learned something from the assassination of his brother. And it was about time. It was Bobby's realization that you can't wait. You have to do the thing in the now while you can. And I loved that about him. GROSS: Since it was the war in Vietnam that brought you both together, what views did you or didn't you share about the war? HAMILL: We both agreed with the way that the country had to go ahead because the war was tearing us apart. Before he ran for president, he knew that, somehow, they had to go to a negotiating table somewhere and negotiate an end to the war. That didn't happen, I think, because he was assassinated. And another 20-odd-thousand Americans were killed. And by one estimate, at least a million Vietnamese were killed before it stopped in 1975. So I think he knew there was an urgency to that, that it was hurting our image around the world - very much like Iraq is now - and that you had to get at it. You had to sit down with people at the table and say, OK. Let's make sense out of this thing. GROSS: You wrote Bobby Kennedy a letter... HAMILL: I did. GROSS: ...Urging him to run for president. So what was the response to the letter? HAMILL: Well, apparently, it had some effect. When Lyndon Johnson finally decided not to run again, Kennedy was then free. And he announced almost immediately after that. And I got a telegram in Ireland saying, I've taken your advice. Come home. And let's go to work. And I got on the first plane the next day and went back and worked for a while for the campaign, but not too long. I found out that I was a newspaper man and not somebody who worked on campaigns. But I - so I left and then covered the campaign up until the end. GROSS: When you wrote the letter to Bobby Kennedy urging him to run for the presidency, assassination was very much on your mind. HAMILL: Yes. GROSS: You certainly knew about his brother's assassination. You were in Ireland at the time you wrote the letter finishing up a thriller you were writing about... HAMILL: Yes. GROSS: ...The assassination of the pope. HAMILL: Yes. GROSS: So when you urged Bobby Kennedy to run for president, did you think at all, well, maybe - maybe - this would leave him vulnerable to assassination himself? HAMILL: You know, I did because there had been a couple of other assassinations - Malcolm X, Medgar Evers. There were then, as now, millions of guns in the country and not more than a few nuts. So it was a possibility. But I had never really talked to him about the assassination until I mentioned in this letter the pictures on the walls as I saw and watched. And I didn't know how to raise it. So I didn't have a conversation that said, look; some nut could be out there. But I didn't think I needed to. In his eyes, there was almost always - in the photographs in this book that we're talking about, you can see it in the eyes. There was a kind of fatalism that it could happen to Jack, it could happen to anybody. And so I felt not - that I shouldn't raise it. And I regretted that. I regret it now insofar as that letter propelled him into the race. I feel bad about that. I wish he was around right now, 83 or 84 years old, sitting in a rocker and talking about the good times when he was president - or not president, when Jack was president and not what, in fact, happened. And then when it happened, it was - it felt like there could have been no other ending. You know, you just walked around and said, why didn't I say something? Why didn't - why did I do this, that or the other? GROSS: We're listening to the interview I recorded with journalist Pete Hamill in 2008 on the anniversary of Robert Kennedy's assassination. Hamill died yesterday. We'll hear more of the interview after a break. And we'll hear an interview recorded with him in 2011 after the publication of his novel \"Tabloid City.\" I'm Terry Gross. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THELONIOUS MONK'S \"RUBY, MY DEAR\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Today, we're remembering journalist Pete Hamill and listening back to interviews with him. Hamill died yesterday. Let's get back to the interview I recorded with him in 2008, on the 40th anniversary of Robert Kennedy's assassination. Hamill and Kennedy were friends. Hamill helped convince Kennedy to run for president. On the night Kennedy was shot, Hamill helped tackle and disarm the assassin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) GROSS: Let's talk about your memories of the night Bobby Kennedy was killed. It was a big night for his presidential campaign, the night of the California primary. Why was that so important? HAMILL: Well, politically, he had lost the primary the week before in Oregon to Eugene McCarthy. So if he lost California, he could not go to the convention in August and make - try to make a case that he's the one that could win the election. So he had to win California. It was a different year in the sense that, on that evening, when we assembled - various of us - in a couple of different rooms at the Ambassador Hotel, on the fifth floor, you know, there were no cable television shows. There were no cellphones. There was - you know, the phone would ring, someone'd pick it up and come over and whisper, you know? You didn't know. But there was a sense, a gathering sense, all that week that he was going to win California. To begin with, he had become the first American candidate for president who had rallied the Mexican Americans. And I think that had to do with something else 'cause I've been going to Mexico for 50 years and know many, many Mexicans. They have exactly the same fatalistic look at the world that the Irish have, I think (laughter). I think their sense that what will be will be was present, and they saw it in Kennedy, and it made him even more attractive than the simple political allegiances that he was calling forth. So it looked like he was going to win, but you never - nobody knew. So there was a sense that you could win. And then when the news finally came, people shouted and cheered and started getting dressed to go down to the ballroom. GROSS: You went down to the ballroom. HAMILL: I did. I went down in the freight elevator with Kennedy and Bill Barry, who was the head of security, and four or five other people jammed into this freight elevator, down to the back of the ballroom, which opened onto the kitchen. And we all got up on the stage behind Kennedy. I was in the very last row, and George Plimpton was beside me. And he realized that there was no wall behind the curtain we were leaning on and warned everybody. We all laughed. And then Kennedy came and made his acceptance speech, which ended with, onto Chicago. And then we turned to go back into the kitchen. Half the stage turned left, and half the stage turned right because there were no paths, really. And I ended up in the actual room where the steam tables were and an old rusty ice machine and a few other things. And Kennedy was walking towards us. I was walking backwards, making notes of what he was doing. There were a number of his people right behind him. And then he turned to shake hands with one of three Mexican busboys who were at the end of the steam tables that were in a lot of the pictures, a fellow named Juan Romero. And as he was shaking hands and turned to face this fellow, turned to his own left - pap (ph), pap, pap, pap, pap - the shots rang out. GROSS: Did you know right away what was happening? HAMILL: Yes, because I turned and I saw a fellow, this guy who turned out to be Sirhan Sirhan - his right leg plant forward and the gun straight out. It was about - I don't know - three feet from Kennedy's head. And he was directly to my right. And it was a real gun. And there was that amazing whoosh of that action, suddenly - a frozen moment and then, holy - everybody charging. And I was one of the group - Rosey Grier, Plimpton, others - who slammed into Sirhan and started wrestling for the pistol and bringing his arm down. And because his arm was going down, a lot of the people behind Kennedy got shot in the leg - not a lot, but two or three people got shot in the legs because the arm was being forced down, until they finally got the gun out of his hand. And for me, the reporter took over. After one moment of initial rage, throwing a punch over somebody's shoulder, I started just making notes. I became a recording machine and watched as they slammed Sirhan up on these steam tables and pulled him way down the kitchen - length of the kitchen. Bobby was on the floor. I thought he was shot in the chest because there was blood on his shirt and on his fingers, but it was because his hand had brushed his head above and behind the ear, where the bullet - the first of three bullets - entered him, and he got it on his fingertips. And I remember so clearly Jesse Unruh, who was the head of the Democratic Party in California running around saying, no Dallas, no Dallas, no Dallas - meaning they didn't want Sirhan to be killed the way Jack Ruby killed Lee Harvey Oswald the day - the next day after Dallas. GROSS: Don't kill the evidence. HAMILL: Yeah, don't kill the killer; try to find out what he's made of, who he is, what's this about, etc. They kept him alive. GROSS: Pete Hamill, recorded in 2008, on the 40th anniversary of Robert Kennedy's assassination. Hamill died yesterday. After we take a short break, we'll hear an interview with him from 2011, recorded after the publication of his novel \"Tabloid City.\" Hamill had worked at the New York tabloids the Post and the Daily News. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Today we're remembering journalist Pete Hamill, who died yesterday at the age of 85. Hamill wrote for several magazines and New York newspapers, but he was most associated with two New York tabloids, the Post and The Daily News. He was a columnist and went on to become the top editor at both publications. In 2011, Hamill published a novel called \"Tabloid City.\" He talked about it with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DAVE DAVIES: Let's begin with a reading from the book. Your book \"Tabloid City\" is in part about a New York City tabloid struggling in the digital age. And there's an editor, Sam Briscoe. And the part I wanted you to read was the one - he's describing one of the veteran characters in the newsroom. If you would, please... HAMILL: (Reading) He turns and sees Helen Loomis, three empty desks to the right of Fonseca, the youngest reporter. Briscoe has known her since each of them had brown hair. She was shy then, too, and what some fools called homely, long-jawed, gray-eyed, bony. Down at the old Post - she sat each night with her back to the river, smoking and typing, taking notes from street reporters and interviewing cops on the phone, her dark pageboy bobbing in a private rhythm. She was flanked by good people, true professionals. But most of them knew that she was the best damned rewrite man any of them would ever know. Later, the language cops tried to change the title to rewrite person, but it didn't work. The rhythm was wrong - too many syllables. Even Helen Loomis described herself, with an ironic smile, as a rewrite man. In her crisp, quick way, she could write anything in the newspaper, finding the music in the pile of notes from beat reporters, the clips from the morning papers, files from The Associated Press and yellowing clips from the library. She was the master of the second-day lede, so essential to an afternoon paper, and she often found it buried in the 13th graf of the Times story or in the jump of the tale in the Herald-Tribune - or, more often, in her own sense of the story itself. When her questions were not answered and the reporter had gone home, she made some calls herself - to a cop, a relative, someone in a corner bar she found in the phone company's immense old street index. Her shyness never stopped her, even when she was calling someone at 10 after 3 in the morning. She was always courteous. She always apologize for the hour, but she worked for an afternoon newspaper. That is, she worked according to a clock that began ticking at midnight and finished at 8. Now, everything has changed, even the hours. DAVIES: Pete Hamill, great to have you. When I heard that description, I mean, I worked at a tabloid in Philadelphia for 20 years. There's a woman at our newsroom that I picture. You know, for a lot of folks in parts of the country that don't read tabloids that grew up reading a more traditional broadsheet, they may think of tabloids as, you know, cheap, sensational, kind of disreputable. What are they missing about a tabloid? HAMILL: Well, it depends on the tabloid. You know, you first make distinctions between supermarket tabloids, which are celebrity roundups basically, and the old tabloids. On the paper that I worked at at the beginning, the New York Post, we had Murray Kempton, who wrote like an 18th-century restoration dramatist. We had Nora Ephron, who was a brilliant writer when she was a kid, working into the city room. And we had Mary McGrory in the paper. We had William F. Buckley in the paper. These were not people who thought the audience was stupid. They thought the audience was smart, and they wrote up to the audience instead of down. And I think that's the kind of paper that's rapidly fading, mainly because order (ph) - a lot of editors are afraid of offending anyone. And the result is often a bland kind of porridge. DAVIES: One of the things I love about your description of this tabloid, which is set in the present day, when, you know, digital media threaten it, are the little details that tell you how the business has changed. Did you visit tabloids that are struggling these days, or was that all intuitive to you? What were some of the details that you saw that really told that story? HAMILL: Well, the first thing, which I note in reading about Helen Loomis, the rewrite man - nobody smokes. You're not allowed to. In my day, people smoked all the time. There was a blue nicotine fog in most of the city rooms, and people often put out cigarettes on the floor. That is gone forever, I think. I also see, because of the digital access - there were - a lot of people used to come into the city room, for example photographers. Photographers know a lot about the city, and you're a fool not to draw on them as a resource if you're writing about the city. Now they can send their photos in from the trunk of their cars. They don't have to come in and develop film and look at it and watch it develop in the developer. There's a different process going on. City rooms also are quieter now. They used to have a hammering sound when deadline came, where people assaulting typewriters trying to make the deadline, which is four minutes away. And then they would come to the end - cah-tuh-buh-bak-a-tuh-baka-tuh-baka-tuh-bop (ph). And that would be it. It would go silence. It was too late for anything else. More often than not, the sound of a city room now is - resembles an insurance company or something. (LAUGHTER) HAMILL: It's not that old raucous, bawdy yelling over somebody - the obscenities, the casual bad language, the urgency of people's speech. You know, the new technology is not noisy (laughter). You don't hear the printing guys now one floor down banging away on lead type in the - on the stone, as they used to call it, to make it fit. So - but I think the passion is still there. I think people work on newspapers not to get rich - God knows - but because they believe in the craft. DAVIES: And, of course, this newsroom, like so many, has lots of empty desks. You've got a situation where the editor is disappointed in the quality of the photo they have for a big story because they didn't have a photographer, and the reporter snapped a shot with his iPhone. HAMILL: Exactly. (LAUGHTER) DAVIES: And the other thing I love was how the editor and a lot of the old-timers in the newsroom don't even look at their own newspaper's website. HAMILL: Yes. And in the case of my editor, he doesn't even know much - he's gone on it a couple of times with instruction from a different generation and looks at it, goes hmm and then decides - and when he decides not to accept the offer to become the head of the website when the publisher decides to fold the newspaper, he says, I can't. I'm a newspaper man. DAVIES: There's a guy in here, Freddie Wheeler, who is a guy who was fired from this tabloid and is now a celebrity blogger, works in his one-bedroom apartment in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, you know, surrounded by computer screens and caffeine and working with this deep intensity and passion to get even with people who wronged him. Is this somebody you know? HAMILL: No. It's really more of a composite of a few people, not that I knew particularly but who some of the younger reporters remember. A guy gets canned for - because there's no money left to pay him to write another gossip column, and he goes off into a blog and decides vengeance is mine, sayeth the lord. There's other people like that around the web. I mean, a lot of blogs are, on one level, therapy for certain people. A lot of them are very good and instructional from things that I've been cued into by others saying take a look at this. But journalism itself is a special kind of craft, and it demands objectivity and clarity and the attempt to really answer questions without taking positions on every single one of them, you know, because in my years, I was a columnist. And I was a columnist in a period of Kempton and Breslin and Mike Royko and others, Jack McKinney and people like that in Philadelphia. And we came from a tradition where we were paid to have opinions, but the opinions were based on the reporting, whether it was Vietnam or Northern Ireland or the wrong part of town. We had been there. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with journalist Pete Hamill in 2011 after the publication of Hamill's novel \"Tabloid City.\" After a break, we'll hear more of the interview as we conclude our remembrance of Hamill. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CHARLES MINGUS' \"SELF-PORTRAIT IN THREE COLOURS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. We're remembering journalist Pete Hamill, who died yesterday. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Hamill in 2011 after the publication of Hamill's novel \"Tabloid City.\" Hamill wrote for The New York tabloids The Post and The Daily News and became the top editor of each of those publications. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) DAVIES: You grew up in a working-class family in Brooklyn, the oldest of seven kids, right? Both parents emigrated from Northern Ireland. And you found reading at an early age and got a scholarship to the Regis High School in Manhattan. And then at - when you were a teenager, you dropped out and went to work in the Brooklyn Navy Yard as an apprentice sheet metal worker, right? HAMILL: That's right. DAVIES: Yeah. What did you think you were going to do with your life then? HAMILL: You know, I didn't know. In that neighborhood, a lot of the guys that came back from the war, they just wanted to marry the girl they left behind and go off somewhere that was not a tenement. So they took the housing benefits from the GI Bill. My generation, the GI Bill changed everything. It was the greatest piece of social legislation ever. So you were able to dream of alternatives. I don't know what I might have been. I might have been a cartoonist or a painter or an archeologist or a cop or a fireman. I don't know because I didn't shape a real ambition till I did the dumbest thing of my life, which was dropping out of high school. But dropping out of high school, even then, it broke my mother's heart because she knew that the only way out of certain kinds of poverty was through education. But that was also, in a weird way, the thing that gave me my life because I was never satisfied. I had to keep learning every day of my life. Reading helped me to that because I grew up before television, when - for entertainment - you read books. So for the rest of my life, I played catch-up ball. Being a journalist was the graduate school from which you never graduate. But last year finally - 59 years after dropping out - Regis High School, my high school, gave me an honorary diploma (laughter). And it was - I got it after I had received several honorary Ph.D.s, too, by the way, because the Jesuits are slow at this stuff. DAVIES: (Laughter). HAMILL: You know, they believed purgatory should be prolonged, I think. DAVIES: Right. Regis was a Jesuit high school. Right. Yeah, yeah. HAMILL: It was Jesuit high school (laughter). DAVIES: Right. We learned when you wrote your memoir, \"A Drinking Life,\" in 1994 that you had been drinking pretty heavily and actually had quit in - I guess when you were 37, 38 years old... HAMILL: Right. DAVIES: ...Just decided you were going to stop. You were, by any measure, a very productive writer during your drinking years. What do you think it took away from you? HAMILL: It took - I was a very prolific journalist because I could always squeeze enough out of my talent to get a newspaper piece done. What it took away from me was the courage to test the extent of whatever my talent was. The other thing that drinking did to me was attack one of the absolute necessities of a writer, and that's memory. I would say, jeez, I had a great time last night. What fun. I couldn't remember a minute of it. And that was obviously not a good thing for a writer. There were other reasons, too. I had custody of my two daughters, and I didn't want to be a complete dumbbell in front of them. So - but from the professional and personal standpoint, a lot of it was about trying to find out what was there as a writer and just - 'cause my ambition was not to be better than Faulkner or Hemingway or anything like that; it was to be the best version of myself that I could conceivably be in the time I had on the planet. DAVIES: You know, so many people know that they shouldn't drink or should drink less and struggle for years and years and go to AA meetings and fall off the wagon. You took your last drink New Year's Eve 1972, right? HAMILL: Right. DAVIES: Why do you think you were able to just do it? HAMILL: I think sobriety became a habit (laughter) just like anything else, which means that it probably was not something that I had to do. My father was a hard drinker, as \"Drinking Life\" talks about. And a lot of my friends were. And I was in the Navy, which - you know, the idea of an ascetic sailor is pretty ridiculous. (LAUGHTER) HAMILL: But - and then I was in the newspaper business, where there was a lot of drinking, left over from Prohibition days. After the first couple of years were over, it never occurred to me again. I go into bars and I meet friends there, but they're used to it. It's my weirdness, you know? Ah, jeez, he has a Diet Coke or something. What - how the hell can he do that? And, of course, there's fewer and fewer saloons that I want to ever go visit anymore, either. DAVIES: They're not smoking at the tabloids, and Hamill isn't drinking in the bars. (LAUGHTER) DAVIES: What has the world come to? Right, right. HAMILL: Well, I had a - and I acknowledge in the book that I had a great, good time in them, that I learned a lot, particularly from older newspapermen, in saloons. But at a certain point, it was the classic point of no return. When I sobered up, I realized that I had heard the same joke four times that same night, as it raced around the bar. So - and, meanwhile, I was much deeper into trying to find out where the writing was going to go, and that became the most important thing in my life. DAVIES: Well, Pete Hamill, it's been great. Thanks so much for speaking with us. HAMILL: Thank you. GROSS: Pete Hamill, recorded in 2011. He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies. Hamill died yesterday at age 85.

TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest, Christine Baranski, stars in \"The Good Fight,\" a legal drama streaming on CBS All Access that recently concluded its fourth season. We actually recorded this a few weeks ago, shortly before the police killing of George Floyd and the widespread protests. We postponed broadcasting several interviews, including this one, so that we could talk about the killing, the protests, policing and systemic racial inequality. But we really enjoyed this interview and hope that you do, too. Christine Baranski's character in \"The Good Fight\" is Diane Lockhart, who was spun off from the series \"The Good Wife.\" Both series were created by Robert and Michelle King. Diane is a progressive, smart litigator who's a partner in a law firm. The first episode of the first season of \"The Good Fight\" opened with Donald Trump being sworn in as president, a grave disappointment for Diane, who had planned on celebrating the election of the first woman president. The first episode of the latest season opened with Diane waking up in an alternate reality where Hillary Clinton was president. \"The Good Fight\" frequently incorporates stories that have become part of the national conversation, like white supremacy, police assaults on Black men, the alleged Trump golden shower tape, powerful men who are accused of sexual assault and an attorney general who is criticized for bending the rules to benefit his allies. Christine Baranski started her career in theater and went on to co-star in the TV series \"Cybill\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\" and films including \"Reversal Of Fortune\" and \"The Birdcage.\" She's been in several stage and film musicals, including \"Chicago,\" \"Mame\" and several by Sondheim, including \"Into The Woods,\" \"Follies\" and \"Sweeney Todd.\" Let's start with a scene from \"The Good Fight.\" When the series began, Diane announced her retirement from her position as a partner in a high-powered corporate law firm. But her retirement plans were ruined after she lost her savings, which were invested in what turned out to be a Bernie Madoff-like Ponzi scheme. She winds up becoming a partner at a majority-African American firm. Later in the series, that firm is bought out by a much larger multinational firm. In this scene, she's talking with a senior partner of the larger firm, describing how powerful men are behaving like they're above the law in cases that she's arguing in court. John Larroquette plays the partner. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE GOOD FIGHT\") CHRISTINE BARANSKI: (As Diane Lockhart) Is there some sort of Get Out of Jail Free card for rich and powerful clients? JOHN LARROQUETTE: (As Gavin Firth) Not that I'm aware of. Why do you ask? BARANSKI: (As Diane Lockhart) Well, you assigned me to pro bono cases. And you want me to do my best? LARROQUETTE: (As Gavin Firth) Yes, of course. BARANSKI: (As Diane Lockhart) Right. Well, there is something going on whereby certain people - rich and powerful people - don't have to comply with subpoenas or judicial rulings and can end a lawsuit if they think the ruling will go against them. LARROQUETTE: (As Gavin Firth) You've experienced this? BARANSKI: (As Diane Lockhart) Yes. And Brian Kneef, one of your lawyers upstairs, seems to have benefited from one of those cases. LARROQUETTE: (As Gavin Firth) And you're investigating this? BARANSKI: (As Diane Lockhart) Yes. Now, I'm sure you'll agree that we should all be subject to the same system of justice, but we're not. If I'm given a subpoena, I have to comply. I have to answer honestly. And if I don't, I should be prosecuted. That is the only way that the system works. And if it doesn't work that way, then the country breaks down. It's over. We're done. Now you've given me control of these pro bono cases, and this is essential to my involvement in these cases. LARROQUETTE: (As Gavin Firth) OK. Just keep me in touch. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LARROQUETTE: (As Gavin Firth) Diane, I know that it seems like I am the enemy. But sometimes, I don't even know what's going on in my own law firm. BARANSKI: (As Diane Lockhart) Understood. GROSS: Christine Baranski, welcome to FRESH AIR. Thank you so much for being here. BARANSKI: Thank you, Terry. GROSS: You know, a lot of the shows you've done, you know, are comedies, and they're social comedies. But there's a lot of political material in this. Is the feedback that you get from viewers different because of all of the politically related storylines in it? BARANSKI: Absolutely. The show was not conceived to be a show about life in the Trump era. It just so happened that on election night, we were shooting the pilot. And it's a well-known story by now that Robert and Michelle had to rewrite and reconfigure the pilot to accommodate that new reality. But it transmogrified into a show that is possibly the only show on television that is about people living through this dystopian era. And I get a lot of feedback from people who are just grateful to see a show that reflects their own sense of disorientation and confusion and how people - how they're coping with this, you know, crazy age. GROSS: You know, the show has tried so hard to be in the moment and topical, but it could not have foreseen the pandemic. And the season had to end early, right? Didn't you have to stop production because of the pandemic? BARANSKI: Indeed, we did. And as I'm listening to this scene that you just played between myself and John Larroquette, it's chilling to hear those words because those words were written before the Michael Flynn news story of, you know, the attorney general dropping that case. And for my money, it's our best season ever because it does go to the heart of who's enabling powerful people to get away with corruption. GROSS: So many of your roles in the past on TV and on Broadway were kind of wise-cracking, cynical, slightly alcoholic women. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: And, you know, there's comedic elements in \"The Good Fight.\" But your role - I mean, your character - she's got biting sarcasm when she needs it, but she's not a kind of snarky, cynical, comic character. There's a lot of just, you know, real drama there. Do you think that your voice changes when you're doing a comedic role versus a more dramatic role? BARANSKI: What an interesting question. I think I had to find the voice of Diane during my years of \"The Good Wife\" because I was - I had done so much comedy. And my real challenge with playing Diane was assuming that I was that powerful woman, you know, the senior partner in a law firm that she created, that she had a kind of authority and gravitas. And I needed not to work at it because people who are serious-minded and authoritative really don't work at it. They just are that. So I've learned to calibrate the sound and the tone and the manner of that character to be just much more understated as the years have gone by, which is why I've loved an opportunity to be on the air for all of those seasons because I keep refining the character and refining the performance. My comedic roles were always much more flamboyant and physical in nature, certainly my stage work. So, yes, I've - you know, I've loved the opportunity to vary my performance style and have people see another aspect of me. GROSS: Audra McDonald co-stars on \"The Good Fight.\" And, of course, she's done a lot of music theater. You and Audra McDonald and Meryl Streep did a song together for the Stephen Sondheim 90th birthday tribute, which was streamed on TV because this was during the pandemic, so everybody basically recorded in their homes. Was this your idea to bring the three of you together? You'd work with Meryl Streep in \"Mamma Mia?\" BARANSKI: It was. Audra and Meryl and I have all worked with Steve. We adore him. And a year ago, we took him out to dinner, and we vowed that we would do it again. When he turned 90, I emailed him to say, Steve, the three of us want to get together with you and have dinner, but alas we're stuck, and maybe we'll do it, you know, in virtual reality somehow. And a week later, I got the call from Raul Esparza about the fundraiser. He asked if I would sing something, and of course, I thought, well, yes, of course. How could I not? And he said Meryl was a part of it, and I'd always wanted to sing \"Ladies Who Lunch.\" So the song popped into my head, but then it popped into my head almost at the same time that, wouldn't it be fun if Meryl and Audra and I shared the song as a way of \"getting together,\" quote-unquote, with Steve to sing this for his birthday, instead of having dinner with him? So it was an idea, and Meryl went along with it, and then we got Audra involved. So we each did our part. I had to do my stanza and my, you know, phrases at the end of the day, when my grandchildren were asleep. Meryl had to do hers, you know, in California. And Audra was in her country home. And so we all recorded. We had the same track. And then it was edited and sent out there. But I was delighted with the reception 'cause it was sort of my idea. And I thought, oh, my God. The night before it streamed, I apologize to them, and I said, sorry for getting you into this, but, you know, it's for Steve, and he'll get the joke, and at best, it'll be fun. So the fact that it went viral and people were really talking about it and that I'm talking about it now is a really happy ending. But, mostly, it raised money for artists striving to end poverty, and I think Steve was utterly delighted with it. So, you know, mission accomplished. GROSS: (Laughter) Well, let's hear how it came out. We'll hear the stanza that you opened with, and then we'll hear a little bit of Meryl Streep coming in right after. So this is - my guest Christine Baranski starts off the song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE LADIES WHO LUNCH\") BARANSKI: I'd like to propose a toast. (Singing) Here's to the ladies who lunch. Everybody laugh. Lounging in their caftans and planning a brunch on their own behalf. No. Off to the gym, then to a fitting. Claiming they're fat, then looking grim 'cause they've been sitting, choosing a hat. Does anyone still wear a hat? (Singing) I'll drink to that. MERYL STREEP: (Singing) Here's to the girls who stay smart. Aren't they a gas? Rushing to their classes in optical art, wishing... GROSS: So that was Christine Baranski with a little bit of Meryl Streep, and the percussion you hear with Meryl Streep is her - at least part of the percussion is her shaking the cocktail shaker? BARANSKI: (Laughter). GROSS: Because all the ladies in this are drinking (laughter). BARANSKI: We each chose our choice of alcohol. So mine was red wine, and then it cuts to Meryl shaking a martini, and then Audra has a tumbler of whiskey. GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Christine Baranski. She stars in the series \"The Good Fight.\" Season 4 just concluded. All four seasons are now streaming on CBS All Access. We'll talk more after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Christine Baranski. She stars in the series \"The Good Fight,\" playing a partner in a law firm. It's a spinoff of \"The Good Wife.\" She's also known for comedic roles on stage and screen and for being in stage and screen musicals, including \"Into The Woods,\" \"Chicago\" and \"Mame.\" Like, Stephen Sondheim is such a brilliant composer, but the intervals he writes in songs are sometimes, like, just - they're not typical. They are not the typical resolutions. They're not the typical melody lines. And it always strikes me as a nonsinger that they must be more complicated to learn because they're unusual. So what do you think? Are they... BARANSKI: I think one approaches his work with terror and humility. And I've had the... (LAUGHTER) BARANSKI: And I think that's the best place to be as an artist. But I've had the pleasure and privilege of doing at least eight Sondheim musicals - unfortunately, never an original Broadway production. My first Sondheim musical was \"Company,\" when I played April. That was shortly after I graduated from Juilliard. But yes, always - his music is challenging because he's just such a brilliant man that you try and live up to his level. GROSS: When you're learning a new Sondheim song, what do you do to get it into your head so that you know exactly where to go, melodically? BARANSKI: Well, I don't read music. I took a solfege class years ago, but I didn't study it long enough to really have it stick. So when I did \"Sweeney Todd\" at the Kennedy Center, that was a full production, and I started months in advance to learn it. And I learned it phrase by phrase, and I did it by repetition, repetition, repetition of those - as you said, those intervals. And Mrs. Lovett is cockney, so you have to sing with a Cockney accent, which is also very challenging to make yourself intelligible. I can only tell you that the work I did was so exacting and took months of very careful preparation. And I worked with my singing teacher every day to get those songs so into my voice, into my vocal - because also, Mrs. Lovett goes - you can - her range is very - at moments, she's almost singing in an operatic range with Sweeney. And then sometimes, it's a vaudeville belt. So there's a high range, middle range and low range. So it's by far one of the most challenging, if not, the most challenging theatrical piece I ever did because, although people know I sing, I am not like Audra McDonald or Patti LuPone. I don't sing all the time. I'm not known primarily as a musical performer. So I found it really daunting. But I can only tell you when you pull it off, you get such a high. When I did do - perform Mrs. Lovett, it was just one of the great moments of my career, performing it? GROSS: Would you illustrate for us the point that I was trying to make that Stephen Sondheim writes very wonderful but very unusual melodies, that the voice doesn't necessarily automatically know what to do because they're not typical, like, resolutions. Is there a - can you sing a line that you had trouble learning, it's so interesting but challenging? BARANSKI: Let me see if I can - \"Every Day A Little Death\" is a really odd song from \"A Little Night Music.\" Not odd song, but those intervals - (singing) every day, a little death in the parlor, in the bed, in the curtains, in the windows, in the buttons, in the bread. Every day, a little sting in the heart and in the head. Every move and every breath - and you hardly feel a thing - brings a perfect little death. Now, those - all those minor tones, but they reflect the characters, that melancholy in her marriage, don't they? I mean, I think I may have gotten one little note wrong there because I haven't sung that song in ages. But can you hear the - it's not that easy to learn. (Humming). Yeah. But that's the joy of singing him is he's so - he's such a writer of the complexities of the human heart. GROSS: You know, you said that learning Sondheim songs, there's an element of terror. Is part of the terror knowing that he's going to hear you? BARANSKI: Absolutely. Absolutely. GROSS: (Laughter). BARANSKI: Yes. Yes. And you know he'll hear every note that's wrong. But I will say this because people are so terrified of his, you know, showing up and watching a dress rehearsal, whatever. I have come to know Steve long enough. He is nothing if not a great colleague. And he's not there to criticize or make arch or b****y remarks or, you know, eviscerate you. He is there to just get the work right. GROSS: Did he give you any good advice on singing his songs? BARANSKI: Yes, he did. He wants the truth of the character. Steve is really not into beautiful sounds. He says, don't make it beautiful. Don't feel you have to sing the song beautifully. Yes, he cares about the notes being sung properly. But what he cares about is - because he's such a great lyricist - is the communication of the lyrics, as though people are thinking and feeling on pitch. It's not about how beautiful you sound. GROSS: That must've been good for you to hear because you're known... BARANSKI: Yes. GROSS: ...As an actor, not as a singer even though you've been in a whole bunch of musicals. So it meant that... BARANSKI: Yes. GROSS: ...Like, acting the part was what was really important, not just having, like, a gorgeous voice. BARANSKI: Absolutely. Well, I think all of the great Sondheim performers - Angela Lansbury, Len Cariou - name them, they're all great actors as well. GROSS: Yeah. BARANSKI: He wants actors who can sing. He doesn't want strictly singers. He doesn't want just to hear, you know, \"Losing My Mind\" beautifully sung. When you hear Barbara Cook sing \"Losing My Mind,\" it's so filled with emotion. I mean, her sound is gorgeous. But it's the purity of feeling and what she brings to his words that matters. And I also - I don't know if I can articulate this properly. But there's an elegance to his writing. You don't need to embellish it. His lyrics are the communicators. You don't have to be clever with them. He is already so clever in the best sense and smart that the best thing you can do is take a direct route to his work and not try to, you know, embellish Steve Sondheim. GROSS: My guest is Christine Baranski. She's now starring in \"The Good Fight.\" Season 4 recently concluded. All four seasons are now streaming on CBS All Access. We'll talk more after we take a short break. I'm Terry Gross. And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF STEPHEN SONDHEIM'S \"LOSING MY MIND\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Christine Baranski. She stars in \"The Good Fight,\" which recently ended its fourth season. All four seasons are now streaming on CBS All Access. She got her start in theater, won an Emmy for her first big TV role in the series \"Cybill\" as Cybill Shepherd's best friend and was nominated for her recurring role in \"The Big Bang Theory.\" She's also performed in stage and movie musicals, including \"Into The Woods,\" \"Chicago,\" \"Mamma Mia!\" and \"Follies.\" So you mentioned you took singing lessons to prepare for musicals. What did you learn about your voice through singing lessons? And I don't even mean just your singing voice, but just your voice in general. BARANSKI: Ah, my voice. You know, I went to - I studied acting at the Juilliard School, and we didn't have a single class for musical comedy. So I never trained my voice at Juilliard. And then I was always extremely shy of singing. So singing, to me, when I finally began studying in my mid-20s, it was an emotional journey, as it is for a lot of people. One feels very vulnerable singing, but I did in particular. I remember a nun - I think it was in eighth grade - who humiliated me when I sang a song. She made fun of me. And I still think that moment had a real traumatic effect on me because I couldn't sing publicly unless I was sort of doing a jokey voice. I couldn't just sing in an audition and feel comfortable. So my journey as a performing artist, a musical performing artist, it was a very slow, slow journey, and the teachers who helped me were helping me past a place of fear. And I learned that I had a very wide range, is what I learned. And that's what I've learned, I think, as an actor, is how wide my emotional range can be 'cause I've played a lot of different kinds of roles, and I've played a lot of different styles. So... GROSS: Isn't it interesting that you didn't know that you had that vocal range until... BARANSKI: I did not. GROSS: ... A teacher showed you that you had it? BARANSKI: Exactly. I started studying in my mid-20s, and by my late 20s, I was working with someone who started me singing lieder and art songs and said, you have a very wide range, over three-octave range. And then I got really turned on, and I started studying opera arias. So when I actually sang with The New York Pops back in the '90s, I think I was still doing \"Cybill\" or it was just after \"Cybill,\" I chose to sing the seguidilla from \"Carmen.\" And (laughter) that's a great - it was pretty gutsy of me to do it. But I had The New York Pops orchestra, and Skitch Henderson was the conductor, and he let me do it. And I sang a Debussy song called \"Beau Soir,\" which is a beautiful, beautiful art song. And that was thrilling for me because I am a mezzo soprano. And I think in another life, if I were to do it over again, I might have gone into, serious, a musical career. I love opera. I love music. I think one of the reasons I'm a good comedian is I'm musical in nature. And when I have had an opportunity to just sing, it's the greatest high for me. It's the greatest form of expression. GROSS: You know how you were saying that singing made you feel very vulnerable? And I think that's true for a lot of people. BARANSKI: So many people. GROSS: There's something about singing. What is it about singing? I know you were mocked by the nun. Not a good idea (laughter) for... BARANSKI: No. No, it really... GROSS: To mock a child for singing. BARANSKI: Yeah. GROSS: But why do we feel so vulnerable when we sing when we're not real singers? BARANSKI: It might have to do with the fact that... GROSS: Though you are a real singer, so I should take you out of that. But still... BARANSKI: Well, I would - thank you. I wish I did more singing so I could consider myself a real singer. But whenever I do have to sing, I take it very seriously and start training. And it's a very good question because when we did \"Mamma Mia!\" - but people were cast because of their acting and their personalities and their movie - you know, you had Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth. And they're not - they weren't hired because of their singing. And I can't tell you how vulnerable they all felt, all of us, just having to sing. And I don't know the answer to that. It's a fear of looking foolish. And you have to sort of abandon yourself to the musicality, and so you're kind of letting go - having to let go. And there's something where you feel you're not - you can't hide when you're just singing a song. You have to expose yourself, and people are uncomfortable doing that. It's a kind of emotional nakedness, I think. GROSS: You were in the film \"Mamma Mia!\" and its sequel. And in addition to singing in that and, you know, of course, doing comedic acting, you have a dance scene on the beach, where you're not only dancing, but, like, you're getting lifted by men (laughter) by male dancers. BARANSKI: (Laughter). GROSS: And I don't know how much, like, dance you've studied over the years. But I always wonder what it feels like to, you know, be lifted, like, in one of those dance lifts. And then, you know, like, you're, like, moving your legs in, like, a graceful way. And it always feels like - I hate being picked up. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: So, like, tell me what it feels like to do that... BARANSKI: You know what? If you were on... GROSS: ...And to learn how to be, like, graceful when somebody's, like, you know, holding you up in the air like that. BARANSKI: Well, I think if you were on a beach in Greece and there were a lot of really hot young men, you might get used to it. You might find yourself enjoying being lifted up. Let me just say this. I started - I was sent to ballet school at an early age, and I thought I would be a dancer, rather than an actor. So my primary training as a performing person, young person, was in ballet. And then I studied modern dance. And I was part of a workshop in Buffalo, where we were doing African American dance and modern dance. Anyway, when I applied to Juilliard for acting, I also wanted to study dance. And they told me, you can't possibly do both disciplines. So I had a lot of dance training. And when I did \"Mamma Mia!,\" I, of course, started studying, went back to it. When I played Mame, I had to do a lot of dance training as well, you know, in preparation for anything you're going to do. So by the time guys are lifting you up and spinning you around and you're having to move your arms and legs around, you - you know, I did enough preparation for it. But the funny story there is that we had rehearsed that musical number months in advance while we were still in London, and then we were filming all these other scenes at the soundstage in London at Pinewood, and then we went on location in Greece. So this was months later. We're finally on location when the director says to me, you know, the weather is perfect, and I think tomorrow we're going to do \"Does Your Mother Know.\" And they had just flown in the guys the night before. And I hadn't reviewed that number. We hadn't had enough re-rehearsal. And suddenly, we were on the beach, and in order to create a platform for the guys to dance on, they cleared the sand, laid a concrete slab and then covered it with sand. And these young men had to dance basically on concrete that was covered in sand. And it was just punitive. And we were filming it with - you know, we had to get the shot in. The sun was directly in our eyes. And anybody who's done movie musicals knows, especially if you're on location, how many challenges there are there. And there were wasps at that time of year. We had to stop filming because the wasps go mad and people were being stung. So when I look at that number, I don't think, oh, how - what fun to be on the beach with those guys. Wasn't that fabulously sexy? It was like, oh, I remember the wasps and the sun in my eyes and I was squinting and they were grinding their knees into the concrete and, you know, all of the obstacles. But anyway, I guess we pulled it off. It's a fun number. It's the only number that's sort of a rock 'n' roll number with the guys. And I absolutely loved it. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Christine Baranski. She stars in the series \"The Good Fight.\" Season Four recently concluded. All four seasons are now streaming on CBS All Access. We'll talk more after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTEFIORI COCKTAIL'S \"GNE GNE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Christine Baranski, who now stars in \"The Good Fight\" playing a partner in a law firm. It's a spinoff of \"The Good Wife.\" She's also known for her comedic roles on stage and screen and for being in movies and for being in stage and screen musicals, including \"Into The Woods,\" \"Sweeney Todd,\" \"Chicago\" and \"Mame.\" Your grandmother, if I have this right, was an actress or just a devotee of music theater? BARANSKI: No. My grandparents - both of my paternal grandparents were actors in the Polish theater. I grew up in a suburb of Buffalo, Cheektowaga, but they - there was a very active Polish community and theater. And so they did plays and musicals in Polish as well as English. And my grandmother - I never knew - my grandfather died before I knew him, but my grandmother lived with me when I was a child up to the time my father died when I was 8. And then we moved away from my grandmother. But we shared a bedroom, and I always say she was a Auntie Mame influence in my life. She loved music. She loved dance. She had a vivacious personality. And she even had her own radio show on the Polish radio station, and she wrote a comedy hour with her friend. This is where I guess my love of theater and perhaps my talent comes from. GROSS: Well - and also the idea that you could actually become an actress because you shared a bedroom with one. BARANSKI: Yes, I did (laughter). And she was very theatrical, and she had very theatrical friends. They would come over and just - I could hear them. You know, we would be put to bed, my brother and I, but Nana (ph) was in the living room with her Polish friends. And they'd get drunk and they'd sing and they'd dance. And, you know, as I said, she was really rather an Auntie Mame type and - but she had a great effect on my life, and when my dad died when I was 8 years old, we moved away from Nana. And it's only years later that I realized what a profound effect that had on me, my early years with her, and also the loss of her, how traumatic that must've been for me to have lost someone who was so loving and physically affectionate and fun to be around because my own mother was not that kind of person at all. My mom was raised during the Depression and wasn't terribly physically affectionate. And I have no memory of my mom reading to me or sitting on my mom's lap. It wasn't that she was really cold. It's just she wasn't like my Nana. GROSS: Do you know what brought your grandparents to America? BARANSKI: My grandmother was born in America. My grandfather who came over from Poland after World War I, but Nana was already here, I think. And my other grandparents were born in America. So it was several generations already in this country. GROSS: So your grandmother spoke Polish even though... BARANSKI: Yeah, I was raised in a bilingual household. I heard Polish spoken. In fact, my brother only spoke Polish until the time he went to school. And then he had to sort of catch up. So then my parents didn't want to make the same mistake with me, so they only spoke English. But it's a pity because my grandmother spoke beautiful Polish and as did my other grandparents and I could have easily been a bilingual child. GROSS: So you grew up in Cheektowaga, which is a suburb of Buffalo. Is it fair to say it was a kind of industrial suburb of Buffalo? BARANSKI: Well, there were some factories, but it wasn't - it was very much on the outskirts of Buffalo but, no, not that far in the suburbs. I was within walking distance of my church and my schools. And I, you know, walk to Mass every day. We had to hear Mass every morning. And it was a Polish-Catholic upbringing. And my mother worked in this air-conditioning factory called Hoodi (ph) that made parts for air conditioners. And she was something of an engineer. My dad worked at a Polish newspaper in Buffalo until the time he died. And he died of an aortic aneurysm when he was 49 years old. GROSS: So you got a scholarship at Juilliard. And the way I've read it reported in the press is that you got a thousand-dollar scholarship because you were the most hardworking, economically needy student. Did they literally say that? BARANSKI: They certainly told me when I got the scholarship that they knew I was in need financially and that I was to use the money to live on the following year. And I think the next day, I was in the passport office getting a passport to Europe and spent all the money traveling around Europe alone for two months (laughter). GROSS: Did you feel just a little bit guilty taking the money that was meant for you - to enable you to attend Juilliard and, instead, traveling to - what? - France? BARANSKI: I traveled to London. Then I went and took the ferry to Paris. And then I traveled through the Alps to Switzerland, and then to Italy, and then to Greece. And I didn't feel any guilt whatsoever... GROSS: (Laughter). BARANSKI: ...Because it was one of the greatest things I've ever done. To this day, I will tell you that it was one of the greatest things I've ever done and one of the gutsiest because I was a young woman alone. I was 19. I was staying in the cheapest hotels, you know, walking the streets of Paris and Rome and just discovering all of these extraordinary - I would spend hours in museums and sitting in the cheapest cafe and just thinking it was the most romantic, incredible thing. And it informed me as a human being. And so, no, I have no guilt. GROSS: I read that you were assaulted as a student when you were living with a family in New York attending Juilliard. How did that inform - I think, goes by a man, a young man, I don't know. But how did that affect you in terms... BARANSKI: No, it was a... GROSS: Yeah. BARANSKI: It was a live-in situation. I was living with a family. And in exchange for room and board, I watched the young child. I slept in the baby's bedroom. And I had to be home every night at 11. And then the lady came home from her all-night nursing job. And then at 8 o'clock, I was able to go to school. And I had my weekends off. But I've never really shared the story or gotten into names or anything because of people still who, you know, the wife and the son are out in the world. And I never shared the story with anybody. And I wasn't physically - you know, I got out of the situation by struggling and by crying and screaming. And I got out of it. But the really interesting thing about that story is that I had no choice but to continue to live there under, you know, feeling very afraid and threatened. But I - that was my situation. That was, you know, and my mother couldn't afford to get me an apartment. So I, like a lot of women, you know, just didn't say anything and continued living fearfully until finally I was able to move. And it did... GROSS: Did you have a lock on your bedroom door? BARANSKI: No, I didn't. But there was a wooden screen. And I remember putting a wooden screen in front of the door. And I did live in fear. I did live in fear that it would happen again. It never did, though. GROSS: Was it traumatizing? BARANSKI: I guess it was, Terry. But I don't remember it affecting my life in an adverse way. I was a passionate acting student, and nothing was going to stop me. And if anything, it just made me more wary, more careful. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Christine Baranski. And she stars in the series \"The Good Fight.\" Season 4 recently concluded. All four seasons are now streaming on CBS All Access. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Christine Baranski, who now stars in \"The Good Fight,\" playing a partner in a law firm. It's, of course, a spinoff of \"The Good Wife.\" She's also known for her comedic roles onstage and screen and for being in stage and screen musicals, including \"Into The Woods,\" \"Sweeney Todd,\" \"Chicago\" and \"Mame.\" When you started doing TV work on the show \"Cybill\" starring Cybill Shepherd - and you were her, like, best friend, cynical, wise-cracking - your family was still on the East Coast. And you were basically, like, commuting to Hollywood to shoot it. You were already a mother, right? BARANSKI: Yes. I had resisted doing television for years, which is why I spent so so many years in the theater. I was already in my 40s when I was offered \"Cybill.\" And then, it was a question of, you know, it's really time to make a career move. And this would be good for your career and also good for your finances because it was clear that my theater - our theater salaries, my late-husband and I weren't probably going to earn enough working in the theater to pay for private schools or college education. So it was a very, very tortured, very big decision. They weren't - really weren't shooting a lot of television in New York in the '90s, certainly not sitcoms. So for 3 1/2 years, I commuted. It certainly wasn't easy. I hated being away from my children. GROSS: How old were they? BARANSKI: They were - let's see - 6 or 7, 8 and 9. They were going into middle school. So they weren't really little, and they weren't teenagers because, by the time they get to their teen years, you also need to sort of really be around. But those were challenging years, yeah. GROSS: Were... BARANSKI: But it opened up my career. GROSS: Yeah, it sure did. BARANSKI: It really opened up my career. GROSS: Yeah. And you won an Emmy, too. Were your children angry with you for not being there all the time? BARANSKI: Yeah. I think we coped very well, but even now I feel like I try to make it up to my kids that I wasn't there. It's a source of pain for me that I wasn't there. And they missed me, and I missed them. But, you know, my daughter's raising three kids now, and she now sees, you know, doing the math, how expensive it is, how challenging it is to raise kids. And, you know, the fact is, while I did the \"Cybill\" show, I had a certain amount of money taken out of my salary every single episode and it was just put aside for their college education. And both my daughters went to school, and one went to Oxford afterwards, and the other got a law degree. And it was all paid for in tax-exempt bonds. So, you know, those years were - that was my gift to them. They have no college debt, and they got a great education. And now they're wonderful young women. And I think they now get it. They get that you do what you have to do. But it's - Audra McDonald, I think, did the same thing. And - although I wasn't pals with her back then. Meryl was raising four kids and doing all that movie work and, you know, having to be away from her kids. And it's really a crucifixion. I had to go into therapy to deal with it. I just felt so guilty being away from them. But that was - you know, you play the hand you're dealt. GROSS: Yeah. Well, right now you're living with one of your daughters during the pandemic... BARANSKI: (Laughter). GROSS: ...And your three grandchildren, her three children. BARANSKI: Yes, I'm making up for all the lost years now. GROSS: Yeah, exactly (laughter) Exactly. BARANSKI: I'm just right in the trenches here. GROSS: Yeah. So how are you dealing with pandemic anxiety now? I know the home that you're in, your daughter's home, is in the country. So I don't know how many people you're actually being exposed to. BARANSKI: I'm here in my home, and they're with me. They live in... GROSS: Oh, they're with - oh, I didn't realize they're with you in your home. BARANSKI: Yeah, they live in New York. GROSS: Oh. BARANSKI: And I have an apartment in New York. But my permanent residence is in Connecticut, and I have a home that's large enough, enough bedrooms for the three little grandsons. And so we've been here since mid-March. I would say that, for the most part, life with little children is all about being present with them. And so even though it's exhausting and, you know, I spend a lot of time picking up Legos or dealing with noise - and we also got a puppy - and it's raucous, it's been - I think it's made it easier to deal with this really disorienting time. It feels like we're all in freefall. But for the most part, I would say I live with these beautiful little young beings, and I try and give them the best of what I have as a person, in terms of my wisdom, my joy. And so I think I've had it easier than most, even though people say to me, how can you stand it? You have no privacy. Isn't it loud? (Laughter) And I think I've been curiously blessed to be with them. GROSS: Well, Christine Baranski, it's been wonderful to talk with you. Thank you so much. I wish you and your family good health and sanity during this crazy time. BARANSKI: I wish you the same. And thank you for your questions. They were very deep, and I was glad to rethink about a lot of what you brought up. GROSS: Christine Baranski spoke to us from her home in Connecticut. She stars in the series \"The Good Fight.\" Season 4 recently concluded. All four seasons are now streaming on CBS All Access. Our interview was recorded May 27.

            "article_content": "The Republic of Ireland was created nearly a century ago, and for most of that time two center-right parties dominated politics. But a recent election ended that cozy duopoly.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: First there was Brexit, then Trump, now another political earthquake in an English-speaking democracy - Ireland, where Sinn Fein, the former political wing of Irish Republican Army, a terrorist group, won a stunning upset victory last month and broke the nearly century-long grip by Ireland's two dominant parties. NPR's Frank Langfitt reports from Dublin. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: It's hard to overstate the significance of Sinn Fein's victory. GARY MURPHY: This is the most extraordinary election in the history of the Irish state. BRIAN HANLEY: I think this is a seismic moment in Irish politics. I don't think the two-party system is going to recover. LANGFITT: That's Gary Murphy, who teaches Irish politics at Dublin City University, and Brian Hanley, a historian and author of several books on the IRA. Sinn Fein beat both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, the two parties which have monopolized politics here since Ireland's founding in 1922. The reason... MURPHY: Dissatisfaction with the government is the principal thing. We have full employment here in the Republic. We have a booming economy. LANGFITT: But, Gary Murphy adds, hospitals are underfunded and understaffed. And there's a huge housing shortage, which has led to soaring homelessness. MURPHY: It is feeding into this anti-elite, anti-establishment view of the world that we've seen with Brexit and I think that we saw with the election of Donald Trump - working-class voters rebelling against the establishment and looking elsewhere. EMER MCCORMICK: They want change. People are just fed up with the same old, same old. LANGFITT: This is Emer McCormick (ph). Like most Irish people, she voted for the two major parties in the past. That changed after the property bubble here burst in 2008, when Fianna Fail was in power. MCCORMICK: I'm very angry about Fianna Fail. Like, I'm out of college. I have to finish my masters. And, you know, there was no jobs. And I considered, like the rest of my friends, to emigrate. LANGFITT: The other major party, Fine Gael, came to power in 2011. But Emer says it didn't plan enough affordable housing for when the economy bounced back. Sinn Fein, which political scientists describe as a left-wing populist party, a label it rejects, promised to build 100,000 homes, which appealed to Emer, who runs her own marketing company but, at 37, is still renting. She drove me around her neighborhood to show me the high home prices. MCCORMICK: Like, for our parents, yes, it was tough. They often, you know, lived in one room. But we're not able even to get the house. I mean, this is the reason why I voted Sinn Fein. It's because, you know, what chance do we have? LANGFITT: The two traditional parties refused to enter government with Sinn Fein, citing, among other things, its historic links to the IRA. Here's Finne Gael's Leo Varadkar, who's stepping down as Ireland's prime minister. LEO VARADKAR: For us, a coalition with Sinn Fein is not an option, but we are willing to talk to other parties. LANGFITT: Sinn Fein's history doesn't bother some young people here, like Jack Lee (ph), a student at Dublin City University. He was born about four years after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended the Troubles, a sectarian conflict that cost more than 3,600 lives. JACK LEE: I don't think young voters care so much. The past is the past. We're just kind of like, OK, now, but the future - if Finne Gael and Fianna Fail won't do it, if we have to ask Sinn Fein to do it, so be it. LANGFITT: Gerry Finucane (ph) is a 74-year-old Aer Lingus retiree who also takes classes here. He voted Finne Gael. GERRY FINUCANE: I mean, I've been round when the Troubles started. And Sinn Fein and IRA were very closely connected for so long. And the Sinn Fein have never dissociated themselves from the violence that happened. LANGFITT: Hey, Matt. MATT CARTHY: Good to see you. LANGFITT: Nice to see you. CARTHY: Hello; very nice to meet you. LANGFITT: Sinn Fein's Matt Carthy won a seat last month in the Dail, the lower house of the Irish parliament. He says the IRA stood down back in 2005. And, Carthy says, the other main parties won't work with Sinn Fein - not because of its past but because they're desperate to cling to power. CARTHY: I genuinely think some of our political opponents are spooked, and they're stunned by what has happened. LANGFITT: Is Sinn Fein going to get into government? CARTHY: The quick answer to your question is yes. The only caveat is we don't know when exactly. LANGFITT: For now, Irish politics are deadlocked. Political analysts say the two traditional parties could form a coalition to keep Sinn Fein out of power, at least for now. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, Dublin.

This year's election was among the most anticipated and perhaps most consequential in U.S. history. But it was not an easy election to celebrate. The results rolled in over several days and sometimes seemed confusing. Even now, President Trump has refused to concede. While the outcome is not really in doubt, it is still disputed by the ousted president and his most fervent followers. Like two teams that meet in the seventh game of a World Series, both the Democratic and Republican parties bought Champagne for election night. But in this instance, it was hard for either to pop the corks. Days went by. The bubbly got warm and went flat. It was not just the delay that spoiled the party. And this is not a case of post-election hangover. This was simply a sobering election. The entire campaign was off-kilter because of the coronavirus pandemic, which disrupted the later primaries and forced convention planners to largely abandon their host cities and substitute online productions. Rallies and bus tours were restrained, although Trump revived his in-person events in the closing weeks with apparent effect. In the end, though, the most sobering element for both parties may have been the mixed message handed down by the voters. It was hard for either party to claim a mandate or find a sense of validation. We now know that Joe Biden got a bigger percentage of the popular vote than any challenger to a sitting president since Franklin D. Roosevelt beat Herbert Hoover in 1932. Yes, even larger than Ronald Reagan's share of the popular vote in beating Jimmy Carter in 1980 or Bill Clinton's in beating George H.W. Bush in 1992. (Both Reagan and Clinton won three-way contests that included a strong independent candidate.) But as badly as Democrats wanted to defeat Trump, they have been sobered by their down-ballot frustrations and internal divisions over what caused them. Biden's win, though substantial in both the popular vote and the Electoral College, did not translate to commensurate success for the Democrats in Congress or elsewhere. In fact, while the Democratic Party may yet achieve control of the Senate if it can win two runoff elections in Georgia come January, it lost significant ground in the House and in the state legislatures that will draw the new voting-district maps for the next decade. What stung the most for Democrats was the failure to meet expectations created by polling that suggested a blue tsunami and a new progressive era in American politics driven in part by changing demographics. That they fell so far short of this must temper their sense of joy at recapturing the White House. Enduring dreams of dominance For generations, both parties have dreamed of emerging as the dominant power in our national life. Sometimes they think they are just about to live the dream. Then the voters wake them up. Democrats sometimes long for the mid-1960s, when President Lyndon B. Johnson had huge majorities in Congress and passed the Voting Rights Act, Medicare and other parts of what was to be the \"Great Society.\" But that brief era ended with the elections of 1966 and 1968 and an era of conservative pushback. Republicans have been talking since the 1980s about realignment, and they have taken over in most of the South and much of the Midwest. The Republican Party has also greatly improved its appeal to working-class white voters across the map. The years of Barack Obama's presidency helped the GOP consolidate power in much of the country. In fact, when Donald Trump took the oath of office in 2017, Republicans held more levers of power in Washington and in more states than they had in a century. Yet just four years later, their Washington role has been reduced again to playing defense. To be sure, there were new candidates and old in both parties who rose up, broke through or beat the odds in 2020. There were upstart winners and enduring veterans such as Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who outran the top of her party's ticket by more than 55,000 votes in her home state. There was the impressive recruitment story that led to Republicans capturing Democratic seats with candidates who were women, minorities or military veterans. But it is difficult for the Republican Party to celebrate when Trump has been defeated. And the task of recovery is made all the more challenging by his inability to recognize that reality. By refusing to concede \u2014 and indeed insisting he has in fact won \u2014 the president not only prolongs the process but puts on hold the sense of closure that his party \u2014 and the country as a whole \u2014 expects and deserves. That, too, has a depressive effect on the national mood. No concession, no closure Concessions have often been made with great grace and humility, but that is not their essential function. Congratulations need not be sincere, or even conveyed. What matters is the acknowledgment of the outcome itself. That is what is basic to democracy and essential to good governing at all levels. Withholding it creates anxiety in the national mood and uncertainty in the administration of public authority. In the weeks ahead, much of this will be resolved. The president will have to make his peace, even in his own way, with his electoral fate. But the outlook for our politics in the near and visible future has been clouded and is likely to remain so. We must deal with the pandemic and do it despite the restraints of divided government. We surely must deal with a divided electorate, where more than 70 million people voted for the president, most with great enthusiasm. Despite Biden's victory in both the Electoral College and in the popular vote, they have been told their guy might have won, and they are bound to wonder. We also know that, even in the midst of the highest turnout rate in more than a century, tens of millions \u2014 roughly a third of all eligible voters \u2014 did not participate. And millions of those who did participate used their votes to say, in effect, that the promises of democracy were not being fulfilled for them. And that may be the most sobering message of all.",

            "article_content": "Election officials in Detroit and elsewhere in Michigan are working to count ballots, with little advance time to process mail-in votes.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Our national political correspondent Don Gonyea has been covering presidential campaigns for NPR since 2000. And on this Election Day, we find him in the battleground state of Michigan - in fact, at a voting center in Detroit. Hey there, Don. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Hey. How are you doing? KELLY: I am OK so far. Thank you. So Michigan - we were just hearing from one of our reporters there, Abigail Censky, saying it may take a few days before every vote can be counted and we know who won Michigan. As you interview people there, how do they feel about that? Are they inclined to be patient? GONYEA: Well, other than feeling good about finally being able to cast a vote after a long campaign in one of those swing states that got so much attention - TV ads, candidate visits, the - you know, the whole bit, people knocking on doors and everything else - I can tell you, boy, do people want it to be over. Nobody's talking about being patient. They want to know tonight that their candidate won. But they also do know that with the crush of absentee ballots that came in in the state that it may indeed take some time. One caveat on that, though - officials did start prepping and sorting absentee ballots for counting yesterday, so that may indeed save them a lot of time for the actual counting, which started this morning. So maybe they won't have to wait till Friday. KELLY: Yeah. But stay with the impact of all those mail-in ballots to be counted. Can you tell whether it is having an impact on turnout today, on how many people are left to vote in Michigan? GONYEA: I think it has. I visited a half-dozen voting locations around the Detroit area today. It was the noon hour, and I found no lines. There was a steady stream of people but nobody lined up around the block, down the street like we saw at so many early voting sites around the country. And, again, that's likely because so many voters cast ballots early. And when everything is tallied up here in Michigan, the secretary of state says she thinks about two-thirds of the total vote will have been cast prior to Election Day. KELLY: Wow. GONYEA: So that explains the lighter-than-normal turnout at the actual polling places. KELLY: This is such an unusual election in... GONYEA: Yeah. KELLY: ...So many ways. One side note - I want people listening to know you are home. You're a native of Michigan. I know you've covered politics there for so long. Give us a few places to keep our eye on tonight as results do start popping up. GONYEA: I've been at this so long, I saw Aretha Franklin sing to Mike Dukakis in downtown Detroit. (LAUGHTER) KELLY: That would be something. GONYEA: So that was a little while ago. Anyway, here's what I'm looking for. You always look for turnout levels in Detroit, especially this year because last time around, turnout in this majority-African American city fell off significantly. And Hillary Clinton, who never really campaigned in Detroit, lost the state by just a sliver. She lost by 0.2%. So we're going to see what the turnout is this year. You look at Macomb County. It became famous long ago as the home of the Reagan Democrats. It's working-class. It's gone back and forth from election to election. It supported Barack Obama, then flipped and went big for Trump. The president needs the same kind of performance there this year. But maybe the most important place is Oakland County, a sprawling suburb just north of Detroit. KELLY: OK. GONYEA: For decades - decades - it was reliably Republican. These days, like suburbs everywhere, Democrats are counting on it. Joe Biden is counting on it. KELLY: NPR's Don Gonyea reporting tonight from a voting center in Detroit. Thank you, Don. GONYEA: My pleasure. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Tracy Chapman didn't take long to release her masterpiece. Arriving near the end of the Reagan Era, the singer-songwriter's classic, self-titled 1988 debut opened with a purposefully strummed blast of righteous indignation called \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\" \u2014 a song about class warfare punctuated by a clear warning that \"poor people gonna rise up / and take what's theirs.\" At the time, \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\" could get overshadowed by the track that immediately followed it on Tracy Chapman \u2014 the Top 10 hit \"Fast Car,\" which remains one of the greatest songs ever written about working-class life \u2014 as well as the assortment of weary reflections on abuse (\"Behind the Wall\"), poverty (\"Mountains o' Things\"), crime (\"For My Lover\") and redemptive love (\"Baby Can I Hold You,\" \"For You\") sprinkled throughout the album. But \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\" was and is a crucial tone-setter for the more nuanced character studies on Tracy Chapman: It's there to remind us up-front that the lives she's singing about matter, and that her subjects \u2014 no matter how firmly they've been held down \u2014 wield fearsome power. \"Finally, the tables are starting to turn,\" she sang; that was 32 years ago. Late Monday night, in the midst of the most momentous election of her life, Chapman gave her first TV performance since 2015, appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers to sing \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\" again \u2014 solo, acoustic, unadorned. She might not wait much longer for those tables to turn.",

            "article_content": "President Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive to speak to members of the U.S. military during an unannounced trip to Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq in 2018.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive to speak to members of the U.S. military during an unannounced trip to Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq in 2018. When President Trump was released from the hospital after being treated for COVID-19, he had a prescription for how Americans could handle the coronavirus. \"Don't let it dominate you. Don't be afraid of it,\" he said in a video from the White House. The apparent idea: that the coronavirus, which has killed at least 225,000 people in the U.S., could be wrestled into submission. The way Trump has sold strength as a key part of fighting the virus is echoed by supporters. Garland Thompson was in the cheering crowd gathered outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center when Trump left the hospital. I asked him how worried about Trump's health he was. He said he wasn't. \"He's a vibrant man. He's strong. This man, he looks stronger than Biden. Let's admit it,\" Thompson said. Trump's overt hypermasculinity was a defining feature of his candidacy in 2016, whether he was talking about his testosterone count or his penis size or shrugging off the infamous Access Hollywood tape, in which he talked about committing sexual assault as \"locker room talk.\" That macho approach went on to define his presidency as well. His opponents know it, too, and they're trying to turn this key piece of his political success into a vulnerability. The anti-Trump Lincoln Project has made multiple ads taking aim at Trump's manhood. \"Even Fox said you were low-energy,\" a woman purrs in one ad about the Republican convention's TV ratings. \"We know. It's different now. You're tired. It's hard to keep your [meaningful pause] ratings up.\" Of course, masculinity is interwoven with presidential politics; all American presidents have been men, as have all major-party nominees, save one. Trump didn't create this atmosphere, and he's not the only one who benefits from it, either \u2014 so does Joe Biden. It has boosted and busted the fortunes of presidents. However, Trump has been blatant about amping up his particular, aggressive and pugilistic brand of masculinity. After four years, that machismo has manifested itself in seemingly every area of his presidency. And it matters \u2014 it has potential political and even policy impacts that may last well beyond his tenure in office. \"Carry a purse with that mask\" Trump and some of his high-profile supporters often portray mask wearing as a sign of weakness. He mocked Joe Biden in the first debate for wearing a mask, and Trump implied at one point that to wear one publicly would be to give in: \"I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.\" Conservative commentator Tomi Lahren was more explicit in linking masks to gender, joking that Biden \"might as well carry a purse with that mask.\" In the past, men have been less likely to adopt all sorts of public health measures, like wearing seat belts and helmets, as The New York Times reported. But Trump did not fight this mindset; instead, he continually questioned the effectiveness of masks, despite his own administration's guidelines promoting them. As the president, with constant media attention, he has enormous messaging power to encourage mask-wearing, or discourage it. As it stands, Republicans are less likely than Democrats to believe masks are effective, or to say they wear masks. There was another approach Trump could have taken, says Meredith Conroy, professor of political science at California State University. \"There was a way to make wearing a mask masculine, a different type of masculinity, about protecting other people and being patriotic,\" she said. \"But that's not the type of masculinity that Trump has really ever embodied. So it probably was never going to happen.\" Strongmen, factory workers and Confederate generals There are areas beyond public health that reflect Trump's focus on masculinity \u2014 areas where it may influence policy. For example, there are effects on America's international relations \u2014 as when Trump has praised strongmen or authoritarian leaders. He has hailed Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping as \"strong\" and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan as \"a tough guy who deserves respect.\" Trump's combative style also could exacerbate existing tensions, as when Trump tweeted that he had a \"much bigger and more powerful\" \"Nuclear Button\" than North Korea's Kim Jong Un \u2014 \"and my button works!\" North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the \u201cNuclear Button is on his desk at all times.\u201d Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! Masculinity is also reflected in Trump's economic rhetoric. He was blatant about it this week when he told a crowd in Michigan, \"We're getting your husbands back to work.\" (This is despite the fact that women have disproportionately dropped out of the labor force during the pandemic.) But it also has arguably long been present in the president's insistent focus on male-dominated, blue-collar professions. In multiple major economic addresses and State of the Union speeches, Trump has highlighted professions like manufacturing, mining and construction, but virtually ignored other working-class, \"pink-collar\" workers in female-dominated, care-oriented jobs like nursing or health aides. And in his job-creation initiatives, Trump has also tended to focus on those blue-collar areas \u2014 particularly manufacturing. Indeed, he seems to relish the public appearances he gets to do while promoting these industries, as he dons hard hats or sits behind the wheel of a semi. It's true that manufacturing can provide stable, high-paying jobs and that COVID-19 showed that U.S. supply chains need improvement. However, a relentless focus on manufacturing overstates that industry's importance in regaining American jobs, while obscuring the reality of America's growing working class of women \u2014 often, nonwhite women \u2014 in the service sector. Masculinity and political dysfunction Aggressive masculine politics can fuel political dysfunction, says Kristin Kobes Du Mez, author of Jesus and John Wayne, a book about white evangelicals and masculinity. \"Militancy is at the heart of [Trump's] identity, and militancy requires enemies, and so his enemies are both foreign and domestic,\" she said. Beyond picking fights with foreign leaders, Trump does so with domestic politicians and the news media. The clear idea that comes across, Du Mez says, is that \"compromise is a sign of weakness.\" \"What we lose here is a sense of a larger common good,\" she said. \"And this militant masculine identity really does drive our political polarization.\" If the need to appear tough causes a president to not just disagree with but demonize the other party \u2014 to belittle them with nicknames like Crazy Nancy Pelosi or Cryin' Chuck Schumer, for example \u2014 it's easy to see how it could fuel polarization. It's noteworthy that President Trump seems to have a gendered pattern to his put-downs: He tends to belittle male opponents as weak, saying they are \"cryin'\" or \"little\" or \"low-energy,\" whereas he often insults women's looks or casts them as hysterical. Not only that, but he has a pattern of attacking women of color, as NPR's Juana Summers has reported. Race is also inseparable from this masculine posturing, according to Du Mez. She pointed to the violent suppression of Black Lives Matter protesters, as well as the defense of Confederate monuments and Columbus Day. \"These heroes that are celebrated tend to be white military heroes that enforce this myth of white masculine power as really being the center of American history, the center of the American story,\" she said. Reshaping Republican politics There are signs that Trump's macho rhetoric is filtering down to other party members \u2014 as when Texas Sen. Ted Cruz tweeted that \"many liberal males never grow balls\" or when Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler tweeted a video depicting Trump physically wrestling the coronavirus to the ground and beating up on it. \"I think Trump's exaggerated hypermasculinity, if you could call it that, has, if it's done anything, it's driven women away from the party,\" said Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster who has been critical of Trump. She points out that women have increasingly been filtering over to the Democratic Party, and men to the Republican Party. Overt masculinity may also be shaping how women run within the party, Matthews added. \"I think the Trump era has attracted a different kind of Republican woman who may want to run for office \u2014 somebody who may have a little backlash to the women's marches or political correctness,\" she said. In fact, she says those women are adopting one particular stereotypically masculine prop. \"One of the things I was noticing in the 2020 election, as I was sort of taking a look at some of the Republican women running for office, is how many of them seem to be presenting themselves as not only Second Amendment supporters, but pictures of themselves with guns \u2014 large guns.\" Matthews found that more than one-third of non-incumbent Republican women running for Congress had campaign materials prominently featuring them with guns. Arizona Republican U.S. House candidate Tiffany Shedd, for example, has a photo of herself with a rifle resting on her shoulder on her website. In some campaign photos, Colorado Republican U.S. House candidate Lauren Boebert has a pistol strapped to her thigh. The dynamics here are complicated: the Republican Party has grown more conservative as it has grown more male \u2014 two factors that may in fact be related. Those women candidates simply have to appeal to that more conservative (and more male) electorate. The upshot is this: In a party that has struggled to elect women, where men are the majority of voters, and where the head of the party encourages hypermasculinity, the kind of female candidates who can break through may just be the ones who can speak that language. Furthermore, to the extent that Trump appeals more to men than women, he may be accelerating these long-standing trends of both an increasing gender gap and increasing ideological distance between the parties. Joe Biden talks about the need for American-made electric cars in a summer 2020 campaign ad.\n                \n\n                    Joe Biden YouTube\n                    \n\nhide caption Joe Biden talks about the need for American-made electric cars in a summer 2020 campaign ad. Biden's masculinity \u2014 and femininity For his part, Joe Biden isn't as aggressive in his posturing. However, he wields and benefits from masculinity in his own way, as Vox's Anna North and the Washington Post's Matt Viser have noted. In a campaign video promoting American-made cars, he oohed and aahed over a classic Corvette. \"God, could my dad drive a car. Oof,\" he said. Biden has done the macho act as well \u2014 he has talked about wanting to \"beat the hell out of\" Trump and suggested push-up contests with both Trump and an Iowa voter. He also at one point laughed off accusations of behaving inappropriately to women. \"I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie,\" he said, after hugging International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers President Lonnie Stephenson at a 2019 event. But then, he has examples of himself as an empathetic caregiver \u2014 an image the Biden campaign has worked hard to emphasize. A years-old video of Biden comforting family members of mass shooting victims was recently viewed more than 11 million times on Twitter. In it, the son of a victim ran up and hugged him. \"Thank you for hugging me!\" Biden said, kissing the boy on his forehead. \"You OK? You'll be OK. We're gonna be OK. We're gonna be OK. I promise.\" Some have called this a sort of enlightened masculinity. Conroy, however, thinks differently. \"When people talk about Biden's empathy and compassion and they're like, 'That's a 21st century vision of masculinity.' No, it's not! It's just femininity!\" she said. It may be, she adds, that there's more room for Biden to appear warm and caring among heavily female Democratic voters. That may be evident on Election Day. Polls suggest that the gender gap in this year's election could be record-setting.",

            "article_content": "President Trump was back on the trail Monday night, a week after leaving the hospital for COVID-19. Former Vice President Joe Biden stumped in Ohio, as the two campaigns go flat out before Nov. 3.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump is back on the campaign trail. He held a rally in Sanford, Fla., last night, just a week after he was released from the hospital for COVID-19. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This is the most important election in the history of our country. MARTIN: Former Vice President Joe Biden was on the campaign trail in Ohio yesterday, where he made two stops and had a similar message about urgency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: It's go time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes, not because I'm running because what's at stake. MARTIN: Maybe the message was sort of the same, but the events themselves could not have been more different. White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez joins us now. Good morning, Franco. FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. Let's start with the president. This was his first campaign trip since his COVID diagnosis. What was the tone? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, you know, it really gave the impression that nothing had changed. It was really big. Hundreds of people at an airport outside - they were all tightly packed together. Some were wearing masks; most were not. And they cheered and yelled the whole time. And the president, you know, he really showed no signs that his illness had slowed him down. It was a standard off-the-cuff speech. He roared through an hour of it. Here's just a little taste. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: You know, I feel so powerful. I'll walk into that audience. (CHEERING) TRUMP: I'll walk in there. I'll kiss everyone in that audience. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Just before the rally, the White House physician, Sean Conley, said the president had tested negative for the virus on consecutive days. Conley said that that shows he's not infectious when it's combined with other data that they've collected from various tests. MARTIN: OK. So what about Joe Biden? You've been traveling with him. You're in Wilmington, Del., this morning. But you went with the former vice president to Ohio. What was notable to you about that? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, he went to Toledo and Cincinnati. In both places, Biden gave his stump speech, casting himself as representing the working class and saying Trump was looking out for the wealthy, especially during the pandemic. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: They see the people at the top doing better and better, even in the midst of this god-awful recession. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Biden's event last night in Cincinnati was in this beautiful old train terminal. But it was really not a rally. It was more of a backdrop for his speech. There were maybe 50 people in the cavernous room. In Toledo, it was outdoors in a parking lot with about 30 socially distance cars. The Biden campaign has really been taking a cautious approach to avoid spreading the virus. The contrast, as you mentioned, between the two campaigns in terms of size and style was really striking. But, you know, the fact that Biden is even spending time in Ohio is a sign that the Democrats think they have a shot at winning back the state. Trump won Ohio easily in 2016, but right now polls show it could be a toss-up. MARTIN: And the race goes on. They're both traveling again today, right? Where are they going? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, they're both going to a swing state. Trump is going to Johnstown, Pa. Biden is heading to Florida to talk about senior issues. You know, it's a big, important issue, and it's an opening for Biden because Trump has really been hurting from the pandemic. Both of them are going to be on the road a lot right now. It's crunch time. There are only 21 days left, so the pressure is on. MARTIN: White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez. Franco, thank you. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

Many cities are reporting a surge of volunteers to work the polls although Philadelphia still faces a shortage ahead of next month's election.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Poll workers sit behind plexiglass barriers during primary elections on June 2 in Philadelphia. Many cities are reporting a surge of volunteers to work the polls although Philadelphia still faces a shortage ahead of next month's election. This summer, Pittsburgh resident Jane Hartung heard that the elections division needed help. Poll workers are typically older, and thus more vulnerable to the coronavirus. Since she's 31, healthy and has a flexible work schedule, Hartung volunteered to help. She went through training in late September. \"It was a lot of information,\" she said. \"Being somebody who was really into school when I was a kid, I brought my pen, and was taking down notes \u2013 lots and lots of notes.\" Hartung is part of a surge of young poll workers volunteering to work this fall's election for the first time. Election officials have often relied on older volunteers in the past (in 2018, 58% of poll workers were older than 61, according to the federal Election Assistance Commission) but many can't serve this year for fear of contracting COVID-19. Allegheny County, which encompasses Pittsburgh, was easily able to recruit the 6,500 poll workers it needs to fully staff its 1,323 polling places next month. Nonpartisan groups like Power The Polls have helped recruit hundreds of thousands of poll workers around the country. During this spring's primary elections, Allegheny County had to consolidate polling places because they couldn't find enough people to run them. Officials plan to reopen almost all of those sites for the November election, and now, after an aggressive recruitment program, they have more than enough people to do the job. But among the challenges these first-time poll workers face is getting up to speed on how to run an election. This is the first general election Pennsylvania will conduct using new equipment that leaves a paper trail. So both newcomers like Hartung and veteran poll workers have to learn how to operate the new machines that count and store ballots. They also learned other important details, like how to make sure someone who voted by mail isn't also trying to vote in person. \"I feel very prepared,\" she said. \"I'm going to go over my notes on the Monday before election day just to make sure that I have everything clear and in the front of my mind.\" While urban areas like Pittsburgh faced big poll workers shortages in the spring and are now seeing lots of interest, rural parts of Pennsylvania haven't had the same challenges. \"People will call me up and say, 'You know, I needed two people but I was able to get two of the people from the PTA, or whatever, to join me,' \" said Thad Hall, elections director for Mercer County, north of Pittsburgh. \"So, we haven't had any recruiting issues at all, really.\" But staffing the polls has been much harder in other parts of Pennsylvania, especially Philadelphia. The city typically needs about 8,500 poll workers on election day, and they're still short several thousand. \"We have never had 100% of our poll workers \u2013 not even without the COVID pandemic,\" said Nakea Hurdle, an official with the city commission charged with administering elections. \"So if we're able, this will be a great feat, because Philadelphia is generally looking at a 50% vacancy.\" But Hurdle hopes that this year will be different. The county has had more time to prepare than they did before the primary, and she said she's seen an overwhelming response from volunteers who want to work the polls. \"I am feeling very confident that we will do something unprecedented,\" she said. \"I'm hoping it's one for the books.\" But others worry that even if officials recruit enough people, there could still be problems. \"There's less of a mad scramble, but there's even more of a need for poll workers,\" said Bob LaRocca, executive director of the Voter Protection Corps, a nonpartisan group working to recruit poll workers in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Texas. LaRocca the stakes are particularly high in urban areas like Philadelphia, where a poll worker shortage could mean closing polling places in a high turnout election. \"And this leads to the disenfranchisement of people of color, many of whom live in urban areas but also urban populations in general,\" he said. If the pandemic gets worse, LaRocca worries that volunteers could drop out. But first-time poll worker Hartung is optimistic. \"While I was at the poll-working class, I was with a bunch of people who were just like me \u2013 who were taking down notes, that were asking their questions, that were really invested in making sure the election was going to run smoothly,\" she said. \"That inspired a lot of confidence in me, because I felt like if I'm with a bunch of people who are just as detail-oriented as me, then this election \u2013 at least in Allegheny County \u2013 is going to run really smoothly.\"",

NPR discusses what is at stake for each of them.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Tonight is the one and only vice presidential debate for 2020. Vice President Mike Pence and California Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, meet onstage in Salt Lake City, Utah. And the debate comes at a critical juncture for Pence and President Trump. They are down in the polls amid a growing coronavirus cluster in the White House. NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow joins us from Wilmington, Del. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey. Good afternoon. CHANG: Good afternoon. So a lot has changed since last week's presidential debate. I mean, the president gets diagnosed with the coronavirus. And we don't know yet what the topics will actually be for tonight's debate, but this has got to be a key issue tonight. Right? DETROW: Absolutely. Look; the Trump administration is on its heels after a series of positive cases in and around the White House. And, of course, the administration had already gotten unfavorable views from a lot of voters for its handling of the pandemic. Now it's engulfing the White House. And though Trump was hospitalized - President Trump - his message since being released is that the virus isn't so bad. So I think that and the way the president has acted the last couple of days really do open the door for Senator Harris to be more critical than she might have been if he was still hospitalized. And I think that's especially the case given the fact that his argument is that this is really treatable and it's coming when he's had world-class medical teams working on him. And let's not forget Pence himself. He is the head of the coronavirus task force. So Kamala Harris' communications director, Liz Allen, spoke to all of this in a preview call that the campaign put on earlier today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LIZ ALLEN: Mike Pence is the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. This is the record that they have to stand up and try to defend tonight, and Senator Harris will make a forceful case that their failed leadership has, in fact, failed the American people. DETROW: And I think we can get a pretty good sense of what Pence will say based on what he and the rest of Trump administration have been arguing all along. They'll likely talk about this effort to boost vaccines, which could be paying off in the near future, their efforts to ramp up testing, their efforts to boost the economy. But look; this is really tough terrain for him. And the White House cluster only reinforces it. CHANG: Right. And we should note that we will be hearing from representatives from each campaign elsewhere in the show today. OK. So not only will the pandemic very likely come up in the debate itself, but can you just talk about how the coronavirus is going to be reshaping the whole way the debate is getting staged tonight? DETROW: We know that President Trump may very well have been contagious with the coronavirus during last week's presidential debate. That raised a lot of concerns, so Harris' team has lobbied to have the chairs spaced further apart. The organizers agreed. Then Harris - her campaign asked for plexiglass barriers between her and Pence and moderator Susan Page. The organizers agreed. Pence's team really mocked those and pushed back on those. That's despite the fact, of course, that Pence was at the Amy Coney Barrett announcement that seems to be the center of the White House outbreak. He has been working from home in recent days. And we should say that both Pence and Harris have repeatedly tested negative for COVID-19 over the last few days. CHANG: Right. OK. Let's talk a little bit about how Harris and how Pence are as just, like, debaters. Like, what are their styles? What are you expecting from their performances tonight? DETROW: Harris is, of course, a longtime prosecutor. She's made a lot of her national reputation at Senate hearings, getting witnesses and nominees on the defensive and often flustering them. Debates are a little different. She has had some standout moments on the debate stage. During the primary, it is very awkward for her that her most notable standout moment was when she attacked Joe Biden, who is, of course, now her running mate. CHANG: (Laughter) Right. DETROW: But at times, she was uneven when she was attacked for her record. And she sometimes gave different policy answers at different moments of the same debate. Pence is a seasoned debater. He was thought to have won his debate four years ago with Senator Tim Kaine, but that's more because of a poor performance from Kaine than anything else. He's a former radio host. He's got a pretty smooth delivery. The campaign line all along from the Trump campaign - we saw it again last week - is that Joe Biden is taking orders from the more progressive wing in his party. And Harris is more progressive than Biden, so we can expect to hear a lot of that from Pence tonight, I would imagine. CHANG: OK. And what would you say are the stakes for Pence and Harris tonight - real quick? DETROW: Quickly - Pence, having to give a steady performance for a campaign that's on its heels on a lot of different metrics; Harris, I think a lot of it is introducing herself. She is still the least known of the four major candidates - make a case for herself and how she could be vice president. CHANG: That's NPR's Scott Detrow. Thank you, Scott. DETROW: Thank you.

            "article_content": "Presidential debate organizers are planning changes. During the wait for election results, there are fears conspiracy theories will spread. And, some COVID-19 tests are getting faster and cheaper.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: So if you were kind of cringing during the first presidential debate, you are not alone. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Even the organizers weren't happy with all the interruptions from President Trump, all the crosstalk. So they are planning some format changes for the remaining debates. And Republican leaders are dealing with the fallout from a particular exchange during debate one. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and others are calling Trump out for failing to condemn white supremacist groups. The president was back on the campaign trail yesterday; so was his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. GREENE: That's right. Biden was riding the rails through the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. And NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow was on that trip. He is now in Wilmington, Del. Scott, good morning. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So let's start with the president. He was in Minnesota last night. Did this - did his comment about the Proud Boys, not condemning white supremacy, did all this come up? DETROW: He was asked by reporters about it earlier in the day, and he said he did not know who the Proud Boys are. His quote was, I can only say they have to stand down and let law enforcement do their work. But as you said, this was a day in which the president came under tremendous pressure for not condemning the group at the debate. As a reminder, what he said in that high-profile setting was, Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. There are a lot of signs that statement that millions saw and heard was viewed by many within that movement as encouragement. And throughout the day, Joe Biden said he worried that President Trump was signaling to them and to other right-wing groups to maybe take violent action after the election. Among many, many other implications of that, it's really hard to see how that statement and the performance as a whole won over undecided voters. But in Minnesota, President Trump was defending his debate performance. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Last night, I did what the corrupt media has refused to do. I held Joe Biden accountable for his 47 years of lies, 47 years of betrayals and 47 years of failure. (CHEERING) GREENE: So the crowd we're hearing there in Minnesota, which is a state that the president lost narrowly in 2016, right, Scott? I mean, he's gone back there several times now. What does that tell you about his strategy right now? DETROW: Yeah. He thinks this is one of the few states that went Democrat that he can flip. The polls don't really indicate that at all right now. But he was in a place with a lot of rural, white, working-class voters, northern Minnesota. This is a group that traditionally has really supported President Trump. And the Trump campaign also thinks that they can make headway with suburban voters in Minnesota because of the unrest and mass protests that followed George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police. But polls show that voters have not been receptive to that message, do not necessarily trust the president over Joe Biden on the issue of unrest. And he's losing the suburbs by wide margins all over, according to surveys. GREENE: And so as for Joe Biden, you were with him following him yesterday. And it sounds like it involved a lot of travel by rail. DETROW: It certainly did - certainly Joe Biden's favorite mode of transportation. He just got happier and happier as he was on Amtrak throughout the day. He was going through eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania; again, kind of a similar dynamic of voters that Trump was courting in northern Minnesota. These are filled with people who feel that Democrats abandoned them, at worst disdain them. Biden told me at the end of the day, he thinks a lot of voters in places like Johnstown and Latrobe in Pennsylvania, white, working-class voters in particular, feel like the party has abandoned them. And that's why it stuck out to me that Biden made this pitch multiple times yesterday. JOE BIDEN: He said, take a chance, take a chance on me. And now I understand why some people did take a chance because the fact of the matter is he said that he was going to make sure that he took care of you all. You know, he had his chance, though. Now we know exactly who Donald Trump is. DETROW: So Biden thinks he has an opening with this type of voter. And that's why he was focusing on things like health care, like his support for unions, like wanting to to raise wages, issues he thinks could appeal to white, working-class voters in western Pennsylvania. And even if he doesn't win the counties in places like Johnstown and Latrobe, just losing them by a smaller margin could help him win back the state. David, I feel like I should also tell you that Biden hit peak western Pennsylvania at one point in Latrobe. He was meeting with Steelers great Franco Harris, and they both made a FaceTime call to Joanne Rogers, the widow of Latrobe native Mr. Rogers. It was really a lot of Pennsylvania. GREENE: That is so my part of the world, western Pennsylvania. I can't believe I'm sitting here doing a show in a dark room and you're out there with - in Steeler Country. I'm jealous. Well, I do want to ask you about the debates. There are three debates left before Election Day, two presidential, one vice presidential; sounds like no one was happy with the first one and the organizers are actually thinking of big changes. DETROW: I guess President Trump was happy, but really, I don't think anybody else was at all. No specifics yet, but the Commission on Presidential Debates has said that Tuesday's debate, quote, \"made clear that additional structure should be added to ensure a more orderly discussion of the issues.\" Again, no word on what that would actually be. That is something that Biden was calling for during the day yesterday. President Trump's campaign came out against any changes, saying President Trump was, quote, \"the dominant force and now Joe Biden is trying to work the refs.\" There was some chatter in some Democratic circles that maybe two more debates aren't even worth going to. But Biden said he is looking forward to the next few debates. And he said he thought it's particularly important that he and President Trump talk to voters in the next town hall format. GREENE: NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow on the road. Scott, I'm sure we'll be talking to you again soon. Thanks. DETROW: Sounds good. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: So we may be calling it Election Day, but there might not be actual results for days, if not weeks, in the presidential race, and that's because of all the mail-in voting. MARTIN: Right. And during this waiting game, there is some kind of fear that people will start spreading conspiracy theories, especially on social media. Facebook and Twitter say they are well aware of this. They don't want their platforms used to undermine the democratic process. But what are they going to do about it? GREENE: So before we chat about this, we do want to note that Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters. And let's turn now to NPR's Shannon Bond, who's been looking at all of this. She's in San Francisco. Good morning, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So you're talking to social media companies about these fears. What are they telling you? BOND: Well, you know, they've been thinking about the election and misinformation for a long time, looking back to the lessons of 2016 when Russia used social media to try to manipulate voters and also, you know, things like the 2018 midterms, other elections around the world. A lot of this planning takes the form of these threat modeling exercises. So the companies, you know, come up with different attacks and then game out how they would respond. Yoel Roth, who leads site integrity at Twitter, gave me some examples. YOEL ROTH: A high-profile figure's account gets taken over to the possibility of a large-scale spam or bot attack to the risks of foreign interference like we saw in 2016. BOND: But this time, as Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, told All Things Considered this week, you know, these companies are concerned about what happens not just before the election but also after November 3. Both Twitter and Facebook say they're now going to be cracking down on posts that say, for example, voting by mail is somehow fraudulent, posts that advocate violence to disrupt the transfer of power or premature claims of victory. And they'll do that by either labeling or removing. GREENE: We should say that some of these kinds of messages and spreading doubts have come from none other than the president of the United States himself. I mean, does that fact complicate things for these companies and what they can do? BOND: Well, right. We heard this again from President Trump this week at the debate. He suggested he might not accept the results of this election. You know, in the case of Facebook, this company has come around pretty reluctantly to the idea that they might have to somehow moderate what the president says. And, of course, we've had elections before where we've had to wait to find out who won. Remember back in 2000, the Bush versus Gore fight that dragged on for more than a month after Election Day? But disinformation expert Clint Watts says, you know, we live in a different world now. CLINT WATTS: Yeah, there were some angry lawyers in Bush versus Gore, but it was pretty tame compared to today. BOND: And of course, there wasn't Twitter or Facebook 20 years ago. GREENE: That's true. And, I mean, you cover these companies, Twitter, Facebook. Are they up to this, I mean, if this becomes a real mess? BOND: Well, you know, this is not just about the rules that they're making. It's about whether they enforce these rules and enforce them consistently. And, frankly, the track record isn't particularly great. You know, Facebook specifically has come under a lot of criticism for just not doing that, not enforcing things evenly. Just this week, the Biden campaign called Facebook, quote, \"the nation's foremost propagator of disinformation about the voting process\" because it's chosen to label and not take down, you know, posts by Trump that have attacked voting. Now, Facebook insists it applies its policies fairly. But, you know, to answer the question, we just don't know if the social networks can hold the line after the election. GREENE: NPR's Shannon Bond. Shannon, thanks so much. BOND: Thanks, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: This sounds like good news. Some coronavirus tests are getting cheaper and faster. MARTIN: Right, but there's a catch. Sorry. The new tests are actually less accurate. And yet public health experts say the newer testing could change the way the country handles the pandemic. GREENE: And we're joined by NPR's Rob Stein, senior editor on NPR's Science Desk. Rob, thanks for being here. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: No problem, David. GREENE: So what's changing here with these coronavirus tests? STEIN: So, you know, until now, testing is mainly been used to diagnose people who may have COVID and to test people who had contact with an infected person to see if they caught the virus. But that just hasn't gotten the pandemic under control. I talked about this with Ashish Jha. He's the dean of Brown School of Public Health. He says this new generation of fast, cheap coronavirus tests could spark a paradigm shift in how testing is used in this country. ASHISH JHA: It is a paradigm shift. What I think new testing capacity allows us to do is actually play offense, go and hunt for the disease before it spreads to identify asymptomatic people before they spread it to others. It really becomes about preventing outbreaks, not just capturing them after they've occurred. STEIN: You know, by regularly testing people like all nursing home residents and staff, every prison guard, firefighters, police, EMTs, teachers and other staff in K-12, you know, eventually, you know, waiters, bartenders, store clerks, that sort of thing. GREENE: Well, I mean, as Rachel mentioned, there are questions about the accuracy of these new faster tests, right? I mean, how big a concern is that? STEIN: Yeah. So they do tend to be less accurate. They can produce more, you know, false negatives, missing people when they really are infected and more false positives saying someone is infected when they're really not. But advocates say these tests tend to spot people when they're the most infectious, which is the most important thing. And any shortcomings are outweighed by the ability to quickly test people over and over and over again. GREENE: So, Rob, if we're talking about, you know, testing so many people, I mean, teachers and EMTs and the police and firefighters and people who work in restaurants, as you said, that's a lot of testing, right? I mean, are they available? How many are we talking about here? STEIN: Yeah. You know, Jha and a team at Harvard just completed a new analysis for NPR factoring in the growing availability of these new coronavirus tests. And it concludes that at a bare minimum, the U.S. would need more than 4 million tests a day. Now, you know, the U.S. has never gotten above about a million tests a day, but these new fast tests, they're known as antigen tests, are becoming more widely available. The federal government has started sending 150 million to states. Companies are ramping up to produce tens of millions of them a day - I mean a month. So by some estimates, the U.S. could get there by the end of the year. Now, it is important to remember 4 million is just the bare minimum. This new analysis also concludes that the U.S. needs way more than that, more than 14 million tests a day, to do things like screen school kids and doctors and nurses and store clerks - the kind of screening that could, you know, help the economy open safely. But there are some projections that the U.S. testing capacity could ramp up even more next year. And so, you know, researchers like Ashish Jha at Harvard say it's crucial to come up with a smart strategy to deploy these tests the right way to really to be effective in the way we use them. GREENE: All right. NPR's Rob Stein, senior editor on NPR's Science Desk. Rob, thanks so much for all this. STEIN: My pleasure, David. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "After Tuesday's presidential debate, Democratic nominee Joe Biden heads off on a tour of eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, both key states.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The worst presidential debate in history is just one of the ways last night's debate between Joe Biden and President Trump is being described. The evening featured interruptions and crosstalk, mostly from President Trump. And now both of the major party candidates are back on the campaign trail. Trump heads to Minnesota this evening, while Democrat Joe Biden is on a train tour, riding through eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow is riding those rails with Biden today. And he joins us now, train sound in the background and all. Hi there, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: (Laughter) Hey there. There's a big freight train going by. We're in Greensburg, Penn., right now, where Biden is getting off the Amtrak train right this moment. SHAPIRO: All right. Well, President Trump spoke to reporters this afternoon, saying he thought that Biden looked very weak. And the president said he thought the debate was great with good reviews. Joe Biden did not characterize the debate the same way. Tell us what his campaign is saying. DETROW: Yeah, Biden said that he had expected President Trump to attack and interrupt. And to Biden, he says it really clarified why he got into this race to begin with. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: The president of the United States conducted himself the way he did. I think it was just a national embarrassment. DETROW: This is the theme Biden has been repeating all day in Ohio and now in Pennsylvania - that he was there at the debate stage to talk to the American people, that he wants to deal with real problems - like a pandemic, like health care - and that President Trump, as he showed last night, is focused on himself. Biden did make it clear that he does expect to be at the next two debates. He says that next one, a town hall format where voters ask questions, is particularly important. But Biden did say that he wanted to see changes. He wanted to see some sort of way for the moderator to allow the two candidates to have their actual speaking time. And we did see a statement from the Commission on Presidential Debates that they're working on some sort of way to make that rule a little more clear than it was last night. SHAPIRO: Did Biden say anything about a couple of the most significant moments in the debate, such as the president attacking the integrity of the election and refusing to disavow white supremacy? DETROW: Yes, he talked about both. Biden said he is confident that President Trump would vacate office if he loses. And Biden urged his supporters to show up and vote. He says he is hoping for a big, decisive clear win. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: I promise you if, in fact, we win this election, this president will step down. It's a lot of bravado. He has no alternative. DETROW: There is a political dynamic here. Biden does not want his supporters to be turned off, to be discouraged, to think that their vote doesn't matter. On that other point, Biden also spoke about how the president seemed to encourage and, certainly, nowhere near condemn the white supremacist group the Proud Boys. Biden says his message to that group would be cease and desist. We should note that President Trump was asked by reporters about this. He said he didn't know who the Proud Boys are. He said, quote, \"I can only say they have to stand down. Let law enforcement do their work.\" But that is not what the president said in front of a massive audience last night. SHAPIRO: You know, in a normal campaign, a train tour or a bus tour wouldn't be that noteworthy. But in a pandemic, it's something we haven't seen that much of. So tell us about this trip that you're on right now. DETROW: Absolutely. Biden has been doing events since June. But this is the first expanded multi-stop swing that we've seen. He's making his way through Ohio and Pennsylvania. And like all Biden events since the pandemic began, these are controlled, small crowds. But really, this is the first time that he's been doing multiple stops, giving the same stump speech, getting out and meeting with supporters, something that he'd be doing over and over again in normal times. And beyond the nostalgia of a whistle-stop tour, this is the exact type of swing that Hillary Clinton was criticized for not doing much of. Biden is going to places like Latrobe, Johnstown, Penn., places that really voted heavily for Donald Trump in 2016. He's still trying to get his message out here and saying he is someone who cares about the working class as well. SHAPIRO: That is national political correspondent Scott Detrow from the Amtrak line in Pennsylvania. Thanks, Scott. DETROW: Sure thing. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Erie County, Pa., was won narrowly by Donald Trump in 2016. NPR talks with the heads of the county's Democratic and Republican parties about what get-out-the-vote efforts look like in the pandemic.  SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: Erie County, Pa., a working-class area in the northwestern most corner of the state, has long been solid territory for Democrats. Then in 2016, Donald Trump eked out a narrow victory. Now in 2020, the county is again seen as pivotal. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea sat down with Republican and Democratic leaders in the county. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Jim Wertz, a 41-year-old college professor, was named Erie County Democratic chair two years ago. He wasn't in charge when Trump won here. Still, he's fixated on the numbers. JIM WERTZ: Just 1,967 votes so a really narrow margin - and so for me, for the last couple of years, it's been staring at those numbers. GONYEA: There are so many what-ifs. What if Hillary Clinton had run a better campaign? What if there'd been better turnout in the city of Erie? But Wertz also gives the Trump campaign credit for its use of digital targeting, for getting people to make personal contact with friends to find new voters for Trump. WERTZ: Factor in their social media presence and their online presence and the kind of targeting they did in some cases with the help of foreign actors and others. It had a very significant psychological role. GONYEA: Wertz says the Democrats' goal this year is not to mimic that Trump campaign. It's to build on the enthusiasm Democrats showed in the 2018 midterms and to reach beyond the traditional base. To that end, Erie County Democrats have set up field offices out in rural communities. Wertz talked as he unloaded boxes of lawn signs from the back of his Jeep at one such office. WERTZ: We've made a lot of efforts over the last two years to really talk to and connect with rural voters. And these offices were an opportunity to help us put some roots down in places that we should have been for a long time. GONYEA: As for Democratic strongholds, voters are highly motivated this year, he says, and having a woman of color - Kamala Harris - on the ticket helps boost energy as well. He adds that with COVID driving unemployment up to 14.8% in the county, that should also give some blue-collar voters who backed Trump last time second thoughts. Now to the GOP effort. VEREL SALMON: Stickers, these, you know, ceramic coasters, tiles, you know, whatever and hats, we've just gone through... GONYEA: That's county chairman Verel Salmon, a 73-year-old retired school superintendent and farmer showing off Trump merchandise at county headquarters. They even have Trump 2020 masks despite the resistance of many Trump supporters to wear them. Both Republicans and Democrats are having to find new ways to reach voters amid the pandemic. One GOP tactic - a Trump boat regatta out on Lake Erie. But Salmon says they're still doing as much old-fashioned door-knocking as ever, maybe more. SALMON: If there's a newspaper box out by the road, they'll put it in. But otherwise, they go to the door and knock, leave the bag on the door. If somebody comes, they stay, you know, way back and with a mask on and so forth. GONYEA: Democrats, meanwhile, are being more cautious on that score. Salmon says he thinks voters see Trump as better at rebuilding the economy post-pandemic. He acknowledges that Joe Biden, with his Pennsylvania roots, is a very different candidate than Hillary Clinton. There is no Biden equivalent to the lock-her-up chant at Trump rallies. SALMON: Biden - I think he's a nice enough older fellow, but look at his record. We've got enough years. We've got four or five decades to look at, and it doesn't compare. GONYEA: Both of these party chairs know that Erie County is in play. And even with the pandemic limiting traditional campaigning and providing a powerful political issue, they insist they can still do what they need to do to reach the voters they'll need to win.

Ernst is locked in a close race for reelection this fall against Democrat Theresa Greenfield.\n                \n                    \n                    Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, appears on stage with Vice President Mike Pence in Des Moines on Aug. 13. Ernst is locked in a close race for reelection this fall against Democrat Theresa Greenfield. On Labor Day weekend, a parade of tractors brandishing Trump flags rolled down Highway 30 through the northwest Iowa town of Denison. Farmer Leon Venteicher, a Trump enthusiast who receives chemotherapy to treat his cancer, pulled off the road when he and his wife noticed the parade. \"We are very cautious,\" he said. \"We wear our masks if we can't control the crowd.\" Waiving from a shiny blue New Holland tractor was the state's junior senator, Republican Joni Ernst. Venteicher says he's voting for Ernst because making sure Republicans hang onto their majority in the Senate is just as important as the presidential race. \"I hate to sound like Whoopi Goldberg or Rosie O'Donnell and say I'm going to move out of the country if the Democrats get control,\" Venteicher said. \"But we may be better off.\" Locked in a tight race for reelection, Ernst is counting on support from voters like Venteicher. Her Senate seat is one Democrats have a close eye on. The party needs to net four seats total this November to retake the majority. They could also win a majority with a net of three seats and a victory in the race for the White House, which would allow the vice president to cast tie-breaking votes. Ernst won her seat by nearly 9 points six years ago, but recent polls show her in a much closer contest this time around. Iowa has emerged as a COVID-19 hotspot in recent weeks, and Ernst has come under fire for repeating a debunked conspiracy theory downplaying the severity of the pandemic. The tractor parade ended at a farm where a local Republican picnic was underway. People were enjoying the weather and feasting on picnic cuisine, but hardly anyone wore masks. The picnic came the same weekend that the White House Coronavirus Task Force sent a report to Iowa showing the state had the third-highest rate of new cases in the country. Sen.

Joni Ernst attends a Trump Tractor Parade and Picnic Rally in Crawford County, Iowa on Sept. 6. Ernst did wear a mask, sporting the Iowa State University logo and colors, but when she addressed the crowd, she didn't bring up the pandemic. Instead, she claimed her Democratic opponent, Theresa Greenfield, held extreme views that are out of step with the state. \"I am going to crawl across the finish line first,\" Ernst told the cheering crowd. \"We are going to keep this United States Senate seat, and as you can attest from all of these tractors here today, we are going to reelect President Trump!\" Ernst, who recently completed a tour of all of Iowa's 99 counties, has faced criticism for her recent comments about the pandemic. While campaigning in Waterloo recently, Ernst said she was \"so skeptical\" about the United States' total COVID-19 death count after someone in the crowd raised the question. \"These health-care providers and others are reimbursed at a higher rate if COVID is tied to it, so what do you think they're doing?\" Ernst said, according to an account by the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. More than 193,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, but Ernst said, \"They're thinking there may be 10,000 or less deaths that were actually singularly COVID-19.\" Her comments echoed conspiracy theories that have been pushed by QAnon followers and debunked by public health experts who note that the number of U.S. deaths from COVID-19 is likely an undercount. Medical professionals have called Ernst's comments dangerous, and Greenfield called out Ernst in a video. \"Today I am calling for a statewide mask mandate and Senator Joni Ernst should join me. I don't think she will,\" Greenfield said. \"She should also apologize to our health care heroes and explain why she supports these lies.\" Democrat Theresa Greenfield, a real estate executive from Des Moines, talks with Trent Hatlen, who farms and raises hogs near Rembrandt, Iowa, on Aug. 11.\n                \n                    \n                    Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Theresa Greenfield, a real estate executive from Des Moines, talks with Trent Hatlen, who farms and raises hogs near Rembrandt, Iowa, on Aug. 11. Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, has dismissed several White House Coronavirus Task Force recommendations \u2014 including issuing a mask mandate. Reynolds has not given local officials the authority to set their own mask mandates, but many of the state's larger communities have issued them. Reynolds and Ernst both urge Iowans to take personal responsibility when it comes to wearing a mask. Two days after expressing skepticism about the death toll, Ernst appeared to walk back her comments and acknowledged the official mortality figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Iowa Medical Society said she apologized to them in a meeting, but wouldn't do it publicly. \"There must be some reason that she thinks it would shore up the base of Trump supporters behind her,\" said Karen Kedrowski, director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University. \"If this were a more normal presidential race, Ernst would not be running as hard as she's had to.\" Kedrowski noted if President Trump were less of a polarizing figure, the race would be much sleepier \u2014 especially when it comes to the millions of dollars spent on the race from outside groups. Groups supporting Greenfield have outspent those supporting Ernst, according to OpenSecrets. Meanwhile, Ernst has outperformed Greenfield in fundraising, receiving $14.4 million compared to Greenfield's $11.6 million. But all of this political divisiveness concerns Iowa voter Trent Hatlen. He farms and raises hogs near Rembrandt in the northwest part of the state and says Republicans and Democrats both have good ideas. Hatlen said he voted for Trump in 2016 and Ernst in 2014. But this time, he'll cast his ballot for Joe Biden and Greenfield (who he recently hosted at his farm). \"I think Trump has divided the country so much and got his side so hateful against ours,\" Hatlen said. \"I'm a working-class dude; I'm not some leftist liberal out in California.\" Next month, voters in this swing state will start filling out their ballots. And just how seriously they think politicians are taking a pandemic that has killed more than 1,200 Iowans will have a factor on how those decisions are made.",

Joe Kennedy III for the Democratic nomination for a Massachusetts U.S. Senate seat.\n                \n                    \n                    Allison Dinner/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Ed Markey speaks Tuesday in Malden, Mass., after beating Rep. Joe Kennedy III for the Democratic nomination for a Massachusetts U.S. Senate seat. Updated at 11:30 p.m. ET Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey has fended off the highest-profile Democratic primary challenge of his decades in federal office, defeating the rising Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a member of the state's legendary political dynasty. Kennedy conceded the contest nearly two and a half hours after polls closed Tuesday night. The Associated Press projected Markey as the winner a short time later. Prior to this race, no member of the Kennedy family had lost an election in Massachusetts, according to the Cook Political Report. Markey's victory means the 74-year-old incumbent, who became a Massachusetts congressman before the 39-year-old Kennedy was born, advances to November's general election and will likely continue to represent the solidly liberal state in the Senate for another six years, while Kennedy \u2014 at least for a time \u2014 will be out of Congress, since state law prohibited him from running for reelection to his House seat and in the Senate primary at the same time. Loading... The outcome adds a new twist to an emerging narrative in Democratic politics. Over the last two years, young progressive challengers have toppled well-known longtime incumbents in places like St. Louis and New York City. In the Massachusetts race, though, it was Markey who received support from progressive figures and organizations for his reelection, and his challenger, Kennedy, whose famous surname boosted his name recognition. Indeed, before Kennedy even entered the race, polling found him to be the favorite \u2014 and some analysts were counting Markey out. But Markey ran up big margins in Boston and many of its well-heeled surrounding communities, eclipsing Kennedy's advantages in more working-class cities. Rep. Joe Kennedy III speaks outside his campaign headquarters in Watertown, Mass., after conceding defeat to incumbent Sen.

Joe Kennedy III speaks outside his campaign headquarters in Watertown, Mass., after conceding defeat to incumbent Sen. Ed Markey. Speaking from his hometown of Malden, Mass., Markey acknowledged the young voices who energized his winning campaign. \"Tonight is more than just a celebration of a movement; it is a reaffirmation of the need to have a movement \u2014 a progressive movement of young people,\" he said. Both Markey and Kennedy mentioned the sometimes contentious nature of their primary. \"The senator is a good man. You have never heard me say otherwise,\" Kennedy told supporters after conceding. \"It was difficult at times between us. Good elections often get heated. But I'm grateful for the debates, for his commitment to our commonwealth and for the energy and enthusiasm that he brought to this race. Obviously, these results were not the ones we were hoping for.\" Two well-liked Democrats square off Kennedy's bold challenge of the incumbent rubbed many of the states voters the wrong way, and some Democrats, including former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, bemoaned the fact that the primary would take resources and focus away from the party's efforts to topple Republicans in races elsewhere. During the campaign, Kennedy was often asked to explain why he was taking on Markey, since the two agree on most major policy issues. Kennedy would say it was time for new leadership, and that being one of the state's senators means more than just how that politician votes. \"For most who are struggling and scraping and striving across our commonwealth, the status quo doesn't come close [to helping them],\" Kennedy said this past weekend, according to WBUR. \"And we will not change that by doing the same thing we've been doing for 50 years: by entrusting our future to the same people who built our past.\" Markey stressed his working-class roots, legislative accomplishments and progressive credentials, especially on climate change with his co-authorship of the Green New Deal with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed him. (Kennedy also supports the Green New Deal.) \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is right when she says, 'It's not a question of your age; it's the age of your ideas,' \" Markey told reporters this past weekend. \"If [this campaign is about] ideas, I'm the youngest guy in this race.\" Kennedy, a former Peace Corps volunteer who speaks Spanish fluently, tried to counter by pointing to Markey's vote to authorize the Iraq war and his record on criminal justice, including his vote for the 1994 crime bill \u2014 positions now out of step with the party's progressives. Markey was backed by his progressive colleague, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and his campaign's quirky digital presence boosted his appeal with young people. (Team Kennedy complained of online harassment from some Markey supporters.) Markey reportedly outspent Kennedy nearly four to one on ads in the Boston market in the final week of the campaign. The incumbent topped the final several polls in the race, led by support among young voters, white residents and college-educated liberals. Kennedy, meanwhile, polled stronger among moderates, nonwhite voters and voters without a college degree. Markey now faces Kevin O'Connor, the winner of the Republican primary, in November. Another longtime Massachusetts incumbent, 1st Congressional District Rep. Richard Neal, also fended off a younger challenger on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "We look ahead to the Republican National Convention to see how the party will respond to last week's Democratic National Convention and what its vision for the future will look like.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Tomorrow, it will be the Republicans' turn to put on their national convention in what so far has been an unorthodox but remarkably smooth experiment in virtual conventions. Joining us in real life is national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi there. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Before we talk about the conventions, I want to mention yesterday's quite rare session vote in the House because it happened on a Saturday. Lawmakers approved a plan to basically rescue the U.S. Postal Service. What is this bill's fate in the Senate, though, that is controlled by Republicans? LIASSON: It's expected to die in the Senate. But what was interesting about the vote is that 26 Republicans voted with the Democrats. They defied the president. And it really shows you how sensitive an issue the post office is. The post office - postmaster general has now said he won't make any further changes until after the election but also said he wasn't going to restore those mail-sorting machines that were pulled out of service. Some Democrats say the mail still will be compromised. The purpose of the bill, of course, Democrats say, is to stop the president from preventing the post office from processing mail-in ballots on time. Republicans say this is just a made-up problem. But the bill itself is not going anywhere in the Senate. GARCIA-NAVARRO: As I mentioned, tomorrow is the start of the Republican convention, and it will almost certainly be, at least in part, a response to the Democrats' event. How are Democrats feeling about the case they made to American voters? LIASSON: They're feeling pretty good. All the things that could have gone wrong didn't go wrong. They put together what they think is a very fast-paced infomercial. They got out their message of diversity, of being unified, of saying that Joe Biden was the antidote to Donald Trump's chaos and incompetence. They told the story of Biden as a decent, compassionate, empathetic person. And Biden himself really surpassed expectations. Of course, the president had lowered those expectations for Biden by saying repeatedly that he was senile, that he couldn't string a sentence together. But Biden looked pretty presidential on Thursday night. It looked like he was giving an Oval Office address. So Democrats, for the most part - pretty happy. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you think Democrats left anything on the table, though, as an opening for Trump? LIASSON: Yes. You're hearing Democrats complain that there weren't enough young people talking. There weren't enough Latinos. But more important, there weren't enough white, working-class voters. And the biggest worry I'm hearing from Democrats is that there just wasn't enough talk about the economy, about Joe Biden's plans, specific plans to make the economic lives of ordinary people better. Even though he has laid out his plans on that, they just weren't prominently featured at the convention. And the economy is still one area where Trump has polled better than Biden, so that is a potential opening for Trump. LIASSON: OK. So now it is Donald Trump's turn. This past week, we got a taste of the kind of attacks he'll be leveling at Biden. Here's what he said on Thursday while campaigning in Pennsylvania, not far from where Biden grew up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If you want a vision of your life under Biden presidency, think of the smoldering ruins in Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland, the bloodstained sidewalks of Chicago. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think, Mara, we can safely say the gloves are off. LIASSON: Yes. He went on to say, this mayhem is coming your way, suburban America. That is the message from Trump. But he also tweeted that the Republican convention will be, quote, \"uplifting and positive.\" I think, however, you can expect a blistering assault on Biden and Harris from Trump this week, starting tomorrow. We know when an incumbent is this far behind in the polls, a positive message alone is not enough. The Trump campaign says it will lay out his forward-looking vision, that he believes he brought the economy to its best point ever, and he's the guy to bring it back. But the other thing that we are hearing he might do is change tradition and appear at the convention every single night to speak. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But on the eve of this big week for him, The Washington Post says they have transcripts and recordings of Trump's sister calling him cruel and a liar. Do you think that'll have an impact? LIASSON: It's hard to tell because there was nothing in these tapes that we haven't heard before from others about Trump, including people who have worked with him before he was president. But the significance of these tapes is, this is not a disgruntled family member. This is someone who was recorded without their knowledge - his sister. And she says - in addition to saying that Donald Trump is cruel and a liar, she says he's a phony, that he had someone else take his SATs. Of course, all of this was reported in Mary Trump's book. But now there are tapes. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Finally, Mara, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, tweeted last night that the president will announce a major therapeutic breakthrough on the \"China virus\" - that's a quote. That's on the eve of the convention, this after Trump accused his own FDA of being in the grips of the deep state. What's going on? LIASSON: I think you can expect a lot of dramatic announcements from Donald Trump. That's one of his stock in trades. He - remember, he touted hydroxychloroquine. He likes to present good news. And he also is looking for a game-changing thing like a vaccine or a cure that can help him - kind of like saying, I'm going to have an amazing health care plan in two weeks. Not everything comes to pass. And I think everything that he does announce will be examined and vetted carefully. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Thank you very much. LIASSON: Thank you.

It turns out going virtual has its virtues. Just ask the Democrats, grinning and basking after their first-ever online national convention this week. No one knew what to expect, and there were plenty of doubters looking for glitches, flubbed cues and dead air \u2014 not to mention lots of dull and boring segments. Most significantly, we feared all involved would miss the sense of history being made in real time. But the week turned into a pleasant surprise. While far from flawless, the four nights were in their way as effective as the traditional conventions, if not more so. And they may just have done the party and its ticket as much good as a traditional in-person convention would have in this pandemic moment \u2014 if not more. For the delegates who would have been physically present in the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, the lost opportunity was irreplaceable. Ditto for the disappointed civic leaders and citizens of that city, who have never hosted a convention and wanted the chance to shine (and the boost for local business). Here's a thought: The Democratic National Committee should skip the site search in 2024 and award the next in-person convention to Milwaukee. But for the vastly larger audience that would always have seen the convention on a screen at home, this was a more than acceptable substitute. It probably means we will see more reliance on virtual elements in future conventions, as well. To be sure, the virtual event lacked the scale and energy participants and viewers would get from a vast and boisterous crowd. At certain moments of rhetorical flourish, you waited for the cheering that was conspicuous by its absence. Crowd reaction at a convention is a cue to audiences everywhere, much like a laugh track for a TV sitcom. But thanks to swift pacing and high production values, viewers got a compact and highly watchable two hours of political messaging each night. It was, in fact, remarkably slick. Stars, big and little Each night's program was hosted by a well-known Hollywood personality such as Eva Longoria on the first night and Julia Louis-Dreyfus on the fourth. That may have been too much glitz for some, and it gave Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chair, an opening to say her party's convention next week will feature \"real people.\" But the Democrats' week had quite a few regular folks as well. Instead of hearing delegation chairs bellowing the virtues of their \"great state of\" wherever, we got a video montage of the country with a dizzying variety of delegate participants. It was virtually fun. Another real person who left an impression was Kristin Urquiza, who spoke on the first night about her father dying of COVID-19 after going to a karaoke bar. (\"His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump.\") The heart-tugging winner of the week for many was the brief video made by Brayden Harrington, a 13-year-old boy who told of how Biden has helped him battle his stutter. That video aired shortly before Biden's climactic speech on the final night. While meaningful in itself, it also served to remind the audience of Biden's own youthful struggle with stuttering. Intentional or not, that might have helped to lower the bar prior to Biden's acceptance speech. He was following a stellar lineup of previous speakers who had delivered as advertised, particularly Michelle Obama on the first night. Some will say this event, especially Biden's part of it, succeeded by exceeding low expectations. Laura Ingraham on FOX News said Thursday night that  \"people were expecting him to flub every line and have a senior moment.\" In this view, widely expressed, no one thought Biden's speech would be great, so when it was good it seemed great \u2014 just like the week as a whole. But there was more to both the speech and the week than that. There were times when the made-for-TV formatting worked especially well.  Typically, convention speeches suffer from the competing demands of the camera and the live audience. The in-person crowd's roaring reaction can take on a life of its own, breaking the connection between the speaker and the viewers on screens. But this week's closers were all directed exclusively to camera, keeping the ultimate audience uppermost in the presenter's mind. That was just one way the limitations of the format simplified the task facing convention organizers, who did not need to mount a stage show as well as a TV production. This gave them greater control over the proceedings, unbothered by rowdy delegates or uncontrollable factors \u2014 as when hurricanes curtailed the first nights of the Republicans' conventions in 2008 and 2012. Having a new kind of control, and pinpoint timing, allowed the show directors to orchestrate their performers to maximum effect and stick to their program. Alessandra Goldstein, 6, and her family watched Joe Biden accept the nomination Thursday night from their car outside of the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alessandra Goldstein, 6, and her family watched Joe Biden accept the nomination Thursday night from their car outside of the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del. Yes, we knew we were being deprived of any sense of extravaganza. The fireworks on the final night, and the honking cars in parking lots, were charming in a small-town way, although not as satisfying as the traditional  closing-night mob scene and balloon drop on stage. But were we deprived of actual history making? If so, it happened a long time ago. The national live conventions have not had a serious role in deciding the nominee since 1952, and the platform fights all happen elsewhere. All the suspense is in the primaries and caucuses that happen months earlier. Instead, the big arena blowouts have become essentially events. They have been made-for-TV promotions that sprawl across hours of free airtime with bogus drama and goofy hoopla. This week, under duress, they simply cut to the chase. Balancing multiple appeals The week featured an unusual amount of outreach to Republicans and independents, particularly the working class. Here was John Kasich, the former governor of Ohio, praising Biden and denigrating the incumbent president of his own party. Here were Christine Todd Whitman, former governor of New Jersey, and Susan Molinari, former House member, establishment Republicans who have been appalled by Trump. And Michael Bloomberg was given a five-minute slot on the final night. Bloomberg is the mega-billionaire who served as mayor of New York as a Republican and as an independent and bankrolled a TV-based campaign in this year's Democratic presidential primaries. It fell to Bloomberg to call Trump \"a con,\" as he did in 2016, and to point out that more jobs were created in the last three years of Obama's presidency than in the first three years of Trump's. The gestures to the center-right were numerous enough to evoke some grumbling from the left. But you could also sense some smoke from the peace-pipe Biden's team had shared with at least some of the party's progressives. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders got a featured speaking slot on the first night and a cameo on the final night in a panel of 2020 primary contenders. He returned the gesture by praising his old Senate colleague. Biden, for his part, played up the $15 minimum wage and the central role of unions (\"they built the middle class in this country\"). If the message to the center-right was that Biden would not go too far, the message to the left was that he would go just far enough. There were also vignettes of various white working-class people such as World War II veteran Ed Long who had voted for Trump in 2016 and now switched to Biden. The party was using the online format to send videogram invitations to those who had decamped \u2014 a category crucial to Trump's coalition in 2016 and 2020. When the Democrats last managed to deny an incumbent Republican a second term, in 1992, white voters without college degrees were roughly 60% of their base. Today, such voters are only 30% of the Democratic base, according to Pew Research Center data from 2019. Much of this convention was an appeal to that demographic to return. But that same Pew report also noted that people of color now make up 40% of all those who identify with or lean to the Democrats. That is up from less than 25% a century earlier. And the convention planners were visibly conscious of this fact as well. Most of the top speakers, the moderators and the entertainers were African American. The ticket included the first black woman in history. A featured tribute to the late Rep. John Lewis of Georgia was a connection to Democratic conventions and sacrifices of the past. There was not an equal amount of attention paid to Hispanic Americans, however, particularly not in terms of headline speakers. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the sensational newcomer from New York, got only a minute as a nominating second for Sanders. Hispanics are now the largest minority group in the country, and most have been voting Democratic. This was noted by, among others, former Obama Cabinet member Julian Castro, a candidate himself in the early going of this presidential cycle. The perceived slight to Ocasio-Cortez, 30, seemed an unforced error on the part of convention organizers, particularly because her age group in general had little profile in the programming. When the singer-songwriter Billie Eillish was featured one night, the 18-year-old first-time voter stood out in large part because Gen Z was so little represented.

On the final night, facing only a scattering of reporters and a camera lens, Biden kept his earnest attention on the camera, the stand-in for invisible judges tuning in from everywhere else. His speech ended with an impassioned peroration. He quoted the Irish poet Seamus Heaney saying, \"Once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme.\" Then he added, with uncharacteristic intensity: \"This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme. With passion and purpose let us begin you and I together one nation under God united in our love for America and united in our love for each other. For love is more powerful than hate. Hope is more powerful than fear. Light is more powerful than dark.\" Would it have been more stirring had tens of thousands been present, leaping to their feet and cheering? Yes. But words and message can sometimes be lost amid the animal spirit of a roaring crowd, a brass band and cascade of balloons in red, white and blue. In this instance, the words could stand alone, and the message came through loud and clear. And that was a last, unexpected virtue of the virtual convention.",

            "article_content": "Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr, a 20-year House veteran, is projected by the AP to lose in the Missouri Democratic primary to progressive activist Cori Bush.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Results from yesterday's primaries have some members of the GOP breathing a sigh of relief while Democrats are getting a different surprise. In Kansas, Republican Kris Kobach's bid for a Senate seat has ended. Kobach was a polarizing political figure and a close ally of President Trump. Instead, the state's Republicans backed the party's preferred candidate, Rep. Roger Marshall. But the big upset really comes out of Missouri and for the Democrats. That's where the AP projects longtime Democratic Congressman William Lacy Clay as losing to progressive activist Cori Bush. Jason Rosenbaum of St. Louis Public Radio has been following this race and joins me now. Hi, Jason. JASON ROSENBAUM, BYLINE: Hi. Thank you for having me. MARTIN: Yeah, thanks for being here. So just explain why this particular election and the result is such a big deal. ROSENBAUM: I think that - and this is going to sound like hyperbole - this is one of the most significant moments in the history of St. Louis politics. Lacy Clay and his father, Bill Clay, were in power and in Congress for 52 years. And for especially progressive activists that are linked to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, this is a watershed victory of having someone like Cori Bush being able to defeat such an entrenched and powerful political dynasty. And it happened because she ran a disciplined campaign that was well-funded, and she also had support from high level progressive political figures like Jamaal Bowman, the congressman-elect from New York, as well as a lot of other people that are linked to Bernie Sanders as well. MARTIN: So she had support from other high-profile progressives. What do we know about her personally? I mean, what can you tell us about her? ROSENBAUM: Cori Bush is a single mother. She is a nurse. She is the daughter of a longtime municipal official in north St. Louis County. And she also is - she also was active in the protests after the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson. And a lot of these different things in her life experience kind of was weaved into her victory speech on Tuesday night, where she not only talked about herself and talked about her working-class upbringing but also talked about how the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic decline in St. Louis had affected, possibly, the outcome in this race. This is a clip from her victory speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CORI BUSH: As we face down unprecedented crises from COVID-19 to police brutality to out-of-control climate change and we've decided how to move forward, well, tonight Missouri's 1st has decided that an incremental approach isn't going to work any longer. (CROSSTALK) ROSENBAUM: And from that speech, there were a number of people that were part of the progressive movement in St. Louis. And she did - she didn't have the establishment support that Clay had, but she did have a lot of support from people that were linked to Bernie Sanders in St. Louis. MARTIN: Just briefly, Jason, what's her election going to mean for the people of Missouri? What policy changes could come? ROSENBAUM: Well, it's going to mean that you're going to have somebody who's going to be supporting things like \"Medicare for All\" and the Green New Deal very vocally. But you're also going to have somebody who was on the streets of Ferguson, that knows what it was like to protest - in the halls of Congress. I think out of anything tonight, that is the biggest and most significant aspect of this entire story. MARTIN: Jason Rosenbaum of St. Louis Public Radio, thank you. ROSENBAUM: Thank you.

Ann Selzer. Bringing up the Iowa caucuses should come with a trigger warning for Iowa Democrats like Patt Copley. \"I was in shock,\" Copley, who lives in Marshalltown, Iowa, said. \"And then it just went on and on ... and on.\" It's been a little more than five months since the debacle that was the Iowa caucuses. That first contest to pick a Democratic presidential nominee went horribly wrong thanks to a faulty smart phone app. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg claimed victory before the night was over and counting the results took days. The contest was one many in the Democratic Party were ready to put behind them. Not so fast. Both Republicans and Democrats are giving the state a lot of attention and money in the run-up to November. Many political watchers are calling the state a \"toss-up.\" Copley, a retired cardiac arrhythmia technician, volunteered and caucused for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won Marshall County in February. She is not excited to vote for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden. But she is eager for Donald Trump to be a one-term president. It's a similar situation she found herself in four years ago when voting for Hillary Clinton. She says back then she could sympathize with Trump voters who didn't like their options. Patt Copley is not excited to vote for the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. But she is eager for Donald Trump to be a one-term president.\n                \n                    \n                    Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Patt Copley is not excited to vote for the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. But she is eager for Donald Trump to be a one-term president. \"Your basic poor or working poor or even middle class people were disgusted and wanted just to shake it up,\" Copley said \u2014 disgusted, she says, with the choice between Clinton and Trump. Marshall is one of the many rural counties in Iowa that flipped from voting for Barack Obama twice to Trump in 2016. But this year, the local pork plant and the Iowa Veterans Home have both had COVID-19 outbreaks. Mark Smith, who represents Marshalltown in the state legislature and took over as chair of the Iowa Democratic Party right after the caucus meltdown, says voters here are energized because they believe Trump's policies have hurt the state. \"The trade wars have hurt agriculture, which is so significant to our state,\" Smith said. \"His saddling up to big oil has caused us problems with ethanol.\" Rural Iowa went big for Trump in 2016 and he carried the state by nearly 10 points. Two years later, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds won her gubernatorial race while Democrats flipped two House seats. \"We are purple and woe to any chair that misses that point that Iowa is a swing state,\" Jeff Kaufmann, chair of the Republican Party of Iowa, said. That said, Kaufmann says he feels good about his party's registration numbers following very competitive caucuses on the Democratic side. \"We wondered if we wouldn't see registration numbers spike to a very large degree and it's hard sometimes to stop that spreading once it starts,\" Kaufmann said. Kaufmann points to the recent North American free trade agreement, the USMCA, as a victory for Iowa farmers. Polls here show Trump and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst's approval ratings are falling. That may be why last month Ernst tweeted a video challenging her Democratic opponent, real estate executive Theresa Greenfield, who she accuses of hiding from voters. \"I haven't heard Theresa Greenfield say one thing that [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer hasn't told her to say,\" Ernst said. \"I'm challenging Ms. Greenfield to six debates, two each month, starting in August. Let's let the Iowans hear what we have to say.\" Greenfield won her four-way June primary race last month with a record number of ballots cast \u2014 mostly by absentee. Iowa's Republican secretary of state had mailed every registered voter an absentee ballot request form to encourage voting from home during the pandemic. Campaigning during a pandemic looks a lot different. There are fewer picnics and parades, and the Iowa State Fair was cancelled. A lot of events are held on video conferencing meetings. But with or without the usual campaigning, there's a more favorable mood for Democrats in Iowa, says pollster J. Ann Selzer. She's the person behind the Iowa Poll published in the Des Moines Register. \"There has been a heavy burden that this state has carried that included issues with trade, with tariffs,\" Selzer said. \"And then with the vulnerable industries like meat processing plants during COVID-19. Iowa's just in a position to be in maybe more ready than other states to make a change.\" While Biden came in fourth during the caucuses, his campaign has announced a senior team here and he'll be back in Iowa later this month \u2014 in the form of a virtual event, of course.",

After Biden wrapped up the presidential nomination, the two formed joint task forces to formulate policy recommendations on six big issues. A joint effort by former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to unify Democrats around Biden's candidacy has produced a 110-page policy wish list to recommend to the party's presumptive presidential nominee. Throughout the Democratic primary, Biden stuck to a more moderate platform, while Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and much of the rest of the crowded field courted progressives and advocated for broader structural changes. But as the United States faces a growing pandemic and unemployment rates at the highest levels in generations, Biden has been talking more and more about a presidency that approaches Franklin Delano Roosevelt's, with bold progressive ambitions. The policy document \u2014 the work of six joint task forces appointed by Biden and Sanders in May \u2014 would give the former vice president a road map to that goal. \"The goals of the task force were to move the Biden campaign into as progressive a direction as possible, and I think we did that,\" Sanders told NPR. \"On issue after issue, whether it was education, the economy, health care, climate, immigration, criminal justice, I think there was significant movement on the part of the Biden campaign.\" The document recommends that Biden commit to eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 and to zeroing out net greenhouse gas emissions across the entire economy by 2050. The task forces call for funding universal prekindergarten across the country, expanding Social Security, raising the national minimum wage and eliminating cash bail, among many other long-sought progressive stances. \"I don't think you could find any issue that we couldn't find an agreeable resolution on, that everybody in the room said, 'That will work,' \" said Jared Bernstein, Biden's former economic adviser in the Obama administration and a task force member. \"I don't think you could find anything in there that he won't want to take a very close look at.\" \"I commend the Task Forces for their service and helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country,\" Biden said in a statement on Wednesday. \"And I am deeply grateful to Senator Sanders for working together to unite our party, and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come.\" Biden's campaign has yet to publicly commit to doing anything other than \"reviewing\" the recommendations. If he adopted them, the recommendations would shift Biden to the left, but they would not completely transform the platform he has been running on for more than a year. \"We did not have any impressions that we were going to turn Joe Biden into Bernie Sanders. That was not going to happen. That did not happen,\" said Faiz Shakir, who managed Sanders' presidential campaign and helped coordinate the task forces. Where the health care task force landed The health care recommendations illustrate that point best. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal co-chaired the health care task force. She has long pushed, like Sanders, for a single, government-run health insurance program but didn't bring that recommendation to the table in any of the meetings or negotiations. \"Obviously our candidate who is pushing for 'Medicare for All' did not win,\" she told NPR. \"There was a lot that Biden had already said on health care, which somewhat limited our ability to perhaps get as much as we wanted to get.\" Still, Jayapal was happy with the recommendations, which include expanding the benefits and lowering the costs of the public health insurance program Biden wants to add to the Affordable Care Act, as well as insisting that Medicare, not any private health insurance company, would administer the plan. The task force also called on Biden to pursue requiring employers to offer employees the option to sign up for government-administered health care, rather than company plans. Jayapal thinks the report can help sell onetime Sanders-backers on Biden. \"I feel like I can go and legitimately sell this as something that the movement achieved, something that we were able to do that pushed Vice President Biden further than he has been and solidified the need for universal, high-quality, low-cost coverage for everybody provided through public providers, not private insurance companies,\" she said. The leftward shift of the policy recommendations could provide more fodder for President Trump, who has tried, at times, to paint his Democratic challenger as \"a helpless puppet of the radical left.\" Courting progressives might not be as essential for Biden as most Democrats once expected it to be. Poll after poll shows Biden with a double-digit national lead over Trump and several swing states moving toward the Democratic column. Still, even as he cleared the presidential field faster than any Democrat in decades, party members have remained less excited and fired up about his candidacy and more motivated by the idea of defeating Trump. Sanders hopes this document will get more progressives excited about the goals, not just the existence, of a Biden administration. \"When I talked to Joe a while back, he said that he wants to be the most progressive president since FDR,\" Sanders said. \"Do I believe that Biden believes that now is the time for bold action to protect the working class and lower-income people in this country? Yes, I do believe that's the case.\"",

SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST: Every incumbent facing a tough reelection tries to disqualify their opponent. But a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll shows Joe Biden leading President Trump 52-44, and it reveals that so far, the Trump campaign is having mixed results trying to define and undermine Biden. NPR's Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Here's Trump on Biden at his recent rally in Tulsa, Okla. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters and criminal aliens have more rights than law-abiding citizens. And that's true. LIASSON: Even though polls show Trump continuing to trail Biden nationally and in the battleground, Trump campaign aides are confident they can beat what they call a defined Biden. But defining and demonizing Biden has been a struggle, says David Axelrod, President Obama's top political strategist. DAVID AXELROD: He's an old, white, Catholic, working-class guy from Scranton, Pa., which is why Trump bought himself an impeachment trying to stop Biden from becoming the Democratic nominee - because he's simply not scary enough for Donald Trump's purposes. LIASSON: But not for lack of trying. The Trump campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on brutal ads tying Biden to communist China and others that paint Biden as old and out of it, like this one that begins, Joe Biden is slipping. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) JOE BIDEN: And with... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Now at the age of 77 years old and running for president for the third time, Biden is clearly diminished. BIDEN: All men and women are created by - oh, you know, the thing. LIASSON: Trump, who is 74, is a master at branding, finding and labeling his opponents' weak spot with a single word or phrase. He came up with the nickname sleepy Joe, but that turned into a you're rubber; I'm glue situation when a group of anti-Trump Republicans ran an ad about Trump's mental state with video of the president lumbering down the ramp at West Point. The purpose of the ad was to get under Trump's skin. It worked. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They say there's something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong. LIASSON: Sometimes Trump's attacks on Biden can be hard to follow. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: And he's not radical left. I don't think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left. LIASSON: Wait. Joe Biden's not radical left? That's the kind of testimonial Biden would happily put in his own ads. But in Tulsa, Trump was actually trying to make a more nuanced argument. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left. LIASSON: Republican strategist Sara Fagen, who was President George W. Bush's political director, says it is an effective strategy - if delivered consistently - to paint Biden as a tool of the left wing of the Democratic Party. SARA FAGEN: The Bernie Sanders wing of the party, the Elizabeth Warren wing of the party, the AOC wing of the party. I think moderate Republicans probably look at Joe Biden, and they think, well, he's a nice enough guy. He's been around. I don't really like him on taxes, but he'll be fine. And, like, the reality is he won't be fine. He will be adopting the agenda of these other people that even moderate Republicans want no part of. And I think that's really what the president is trying to do and needs to do. LIASSON: Outside the arena in Tulsa, there was plenty of merch for sale, but T-shirts showing Hillary Clinton were easier to find than anti-Biden gear. It seems as though Democratic women stir up a lot more animus on the right than Joe Biden does, and that makes demonizing Biden a trickier task. So does the fact that Biden has been staying under the radar. FAGEN: He's not out making the typical Joe Biden gaffes on a daily basis. As a result, I think he's harder to define. LIASSON: So for now, the election is a referendum on the incumbent, and Trump is shadowboxing. FAGEN: It does sort of feel some days like he doesn't have an opponent. LIASSON: Fagen is certain the race will eventually become a binary choice. But for now, Joe Biden isn't giving Donald Trump much new material to work with. And for a street fighting politician like Trump, whose best punch is the counterpunch, that is a handicap. Mara Liasson, NPR News.

Updated at 2:59 p.m. ET House Democrats approved a bill Friday afternoon to make the District of Columbia the nation's 51st state. The vote was 232-180 largely along party and the legislation is expected to go no further in the face of opposition by Republicans in the Senate. For decades, Washington, D.C., license plates have bemoaned the District of Columbia's lack of statehood, reminding viewers in bold blue letters of its \"taxation without representation.\" Despite having a population larger than that of Vermont or Wyoming, the District's 700,000 residents don't have anyone voting for their interests on the floor of the House or the Senate. The bill was sponsored by the District's nonvoting delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, and the vote on it was announced last week by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. Norton says her bill holds personal, as well as political, meaning. \"My great-grandfather, who walked away from slavery in Virginia, got as far as the District of Columbia \u2014 got to freedom, but not to equality,\" she tells All Things Considered's Ari Shapiro. \"And so what I think of this bill, at least for my family: I dedicate it to my great-grandfather, Richard Holmes.\" Longtime debate Friday marked the first time since 1993 that Congress voted on D.C. statehood, an issue that has been debated for decades. Norton remembered serving in Congress during that vote. \"We got more votes, by the way, than we thought we would,\" she told Shapiro. Continued Norton: \"It failed then because the House was dominated by Southern Democrats who tended to be conservative on many issues. We were pleased to have them as Democrats, but we could not pass that bill. ... So times change, and they have changed remarkably, and they are ready now, it seems certainly in the House, to make the District the 51st state.\" Today's Democrats have tried to play up what they call their emphasis on voting, representation and racial justice, all of which underpin the political strategy on the D.C. statehood vote. Passage in the Republican-controlled Senate is another story. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told TV host Laura Ingraham last year that any Democratic push for D.C. statehood is \"full-bore socialism on the march in the House\" and that \"as long as I'm the majority leader of the Senate, none of that stuff is going anywhere.\" President Trump has also scoffed at statehood efforts, telling The New York Post in May: \"Why? So we can have two more Democratic \u2014 Democrat senators and five more congressmen? No, thank you. That'll never happen.\" On Wednesday, the Trump administration issued a statement formally opposing Norton's bill and vowing that if the bill ever reached the president's desk, he would veto it. And on Thursday, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas spoke on the Senate floor for 18 minutes to express his outrage over statehood efforts, calling it a power grab by Democrats. \"If Washington deserves to be a state, at 700,000 residents, how much more does New York City deserve to be its own state at 8 million residents?\" he asked. New York City residents already are represented in Congress via their state delegations to the House and the Senate. Cotton also argued that Wyoming, while smaller than Washington in population, is a \"well-rounded working class state.\" \"What vital industries would the new state of Washington represent? Lobbying? Bureaucracy?\" he asked. \"Give me a break. By far, the largest group of workers in the city are bureaucrats and other white collar professionals.\" Senate Democrats, including Hawaii's Brian Schatz, faulted what they called the unfair standard Cotton was applying. DC residents are Americans who pay federal taxes and they shouldn't get screwed just because Tom Cotton doesn't think they have the right jobs. https://t.co/IT3YLozu0H Robert C. White Jr., who serves as one of the District's at-large councilmembers, says the disenfranchisement of the District's residents should supersede partisan politics. \"We pay taxes like every other American state. We fight and die in wars like residents of every state. And we deserve the same opportunity to have a voice in how our nation is governed,\" White tells NPR. White says that even if statehood doesn't get a vote in the Senate this year, he believes the bill's passage in the House would represent a significant step forward. \"The D.C. statehood bill passing the House will elevate the profile of this issue, and as more Americans realize how uniquely disenfranchised D.C. is, I think it will increase the calls for D.C. statehood across the country,\" White says. A 2019 Gallup poll indicates a long road ahead in shifting national opinions on D.C. statehood: 64% of Americans surveyed said they thought the District shouldn't be a state.

Half the country has been personally economically impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and overwhelming numbers of Americans do not think schools, restaurants or sporting events with large crowds should reopen until there is further testing, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. President Trump does not fare very well as far as his handling of the pandemic goes. Most Americans, except Republicans, disapprove of the job he's doing, and there are massive divides by gender and educational level. What's more, with the presidential election less than seven months away, more than half the country prefers that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden handle the pandemic \u2014 and even the economy. The latter being what Trump has been hanging his hat on for reelection. Fifty percent of Americans said they or someone in their household has either lost hours or a job because of the coronavirus, up from 18% a month ago. And the pandemic is having a harsher economic effect on people of color, those without a college degree, younger people and those who make less money. Of nonwhites, 60% said they or someone in their household has lost hours or a job, compared with 43% of whites. In addition, 55% percent of those without a degree, those under 45 and those making less than $50,000 a year said so. \"There are few households in the country that haven't been affected by this crisis, through health, through school, through jobs, from all walks of life, from all backgrounds,\" said Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, which conducted the survey. \"No one has really gone untouched. However, we certainly see from the data as well that a lack of a strong safety net, especially for many middle-class or working-class Americans, it has some really, really big holes in it. She added, \"These numbers show the struggle, the impact the crisis has had on Americans.\" Eighty percent or more of people who responded do not want schools, restaurants or large sporting events to start taking place as normal again until there is further testing. And two-thirds don't want Americans to physically go back to work without that widespread testing, but a majority of Republicans do. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Views of Trump Overall, 44% of Americans approve of the job President Trump is doing in handling the coronavirus. That roughly reflects his overall approval rating in past polls, but his disapproval rating jumped 6 points in the past month, from 49% to 55%. Solid majorities of Democrats and independents disapprove of the job Trump is doing handling the pandemic, but almost 9-in-10 Republicans approve. Loading... Trump gets higher marks for his handling of the economy with 50% approving of the job he's doing related to it. The difference is with independents. A majority of them disapproved of his handling of the coronavirus by a wide margin (58% to 40%), but a majority of them narrowly approved of the job he's doing on the economy (51% to 46%). More Americans, though, think their governor is doing a better job than the president is in handling both the pandemic and the economy. On the coronavirus, almost two-thirds said their governor (64%) is doing a better job than Trump (32%). On the economy, 54% said their governor is doing a better job than Trump (39%). Massive gender and educational divides There are huge splits between men and women and those with or without college degrees, in terms of how Trump is viewed. Men versus women: -58% of men approve of Trump's handling of the economy; 56% of women disapprove; -52% of men approve of Trump's handling of the coronavirus; 63% of women disapprove. College degree or not: -54% of college graduates disapprove of the job Trump's doing on the economy; 55% of those without one approve; -64% of those with a college degree disapprove of Trump's handling of the coronavirus; 50% of those without one approve. The looming presidential election The coronavirus could wind up being the major issue in the 2020 presidential election, according to strategists who are already gearing up for that likelihood. According to this poll, a third of people said the coronavirus will either be a major (14%) or minor one (20%). But about two-thirds (64%) said they've already made up their minds. So the group that could be swayed and is judging the president based on his handling of the pandemic could well be determinative. Also, majorities said they prefer Biden over Trump when it comes to handling both the coronavirus (55% to 40%) and the economy (51% to 44%) \u2014 what could be a difficult sign for Trump. The survey of 1,008 adults was conducted by calling mobile phones and landlines, from April 21 through April 26 by The Marist Poll, in both English and Spanish with data collection provided by SSRS. The poll has a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points. The survey was sponsored in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour.",

With a shiny city bus as backdrop, Vice President Joe Biden rolled up his shirtsleeves for a 2015 speech in Detroit. \"Detroit isn't just an important city,\" he told the crowd at an event celebrating the arrival of 80 new city buses. \"It's an iconic city.\" As vice president, Biden visited Detroit nearly a dozen times, more than President Barack Obama. He was in Detroit again on Monday, this time campaigning for the White House before Michigan's Tuesday primary. In Detroit, Biden often talks about his affinity for the city. He tells audiences that he's a car guy, that his father sold cars for a living, and that he connects with the city's working-class character. But the voters in this majority-black city are also key to Biden's political future. The question now is how much Biden's history in Detroit, and as Obama's vice president, will drive the decisions voters make here in 2020. \"We would never, never abandon the people of Detroit,\" he told the crowd in 2015. \"It's like abandoning the heart of America. And so folks, the president and I decided to bet on the automobile industry, bet on Detroiters, bet on this city.\" The city had a year earlier emerged from the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. During the recession, unemployment had soared into double digits and the auto industry teetered on the brink before Obama expanded a multibillion-dollar bailout initiated by President George W. Bush. Over dinner in Detroit, Biden had asked the city's new mayor, Mike Duggan, what he could do to help the city. Duggan said buses. The city needed new buses. Detroiters sometimes waited hours for a bus to show up, if it came at all. Most of the time, only 58% of the aging fleet were on the road. The vice president came up with a plan. He pointed Duggan to a new Obama administration grant competition. For months, Biden kept checking in. Once, Biden called from an official trip to Ukraine to tell Duggan he hadn't forgotten about the buses. \"He must have called me back a half a dozen times to make sure the project was on track,\" Duggan said in an interview from his office, with sweeping views of the Detroit Riverfront. \"President Obama, when I went to the White House once, referred to him as the vice president of Detroit,\" he said. Duggan, who endorsed Biden early on, says the former vice president kept tabs on efforts to replace the city's dismal streetlights and tear down vacant houses. He once showed up at a backyard barbecue and several times headlined the city's Labor Day parade. \"His heart naturally goes to the underdog,\" Duggan says. \"It's like somebody that you've known\" That feeling is common among many Detroiters, particularly older voters. Cindy Reese introduced Biden at that event in 2015. \"I was shaking in my boots,\" she said, showing a photo of her and Biden on that day. \"But he said, 'If you get nervous, just say, \"here's Joe!\" ' And that relaxed me.\" Cindy Reese introduced Joe Biden at an event in 2015. She says Biden's dedication to Detroit has literally helped make her family's life better.\n                \n                    \n                    Sam Gringlas/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cindy Reese introduced Joe Biden at an event in 2015. She says Biden's dedication to Detroit has literally helped make her family's life better. Back then, Reese told the crowd how her grandson had to walk miles to school in the middle of a Detroit winter when his bus didn't show. \"The buses were ragged, they were breaking down,\" she says now. \"We hadn't had buses in so long. And it was just pitiful.\" Reese says Biden's dedication to Detroit has literally helped make her family's life better. And she says that's true for a lot of people. \"Remember, the autoworkers, they haven't forgotten they still have a job because of Obama and Biden,\" she said. \"They haven't forgotten that.\" Over at the Adams-Butzel Recreational Complex, Gloria Rogers is in water aerobics class for seniors, doing a move called the \"cross-country.\" While she swayed her foam barbells back and forth in the water, Rogers said there's no question whom she's voting for: Joe Biden. \"We need to feel embraced, we need to feel like we did when Obama was president, that we're loved and that we're going to be protected,\" she said. \"No drama Obama. We need that. We want that.\" Vice President Biden greets kids during a campaign stop at Renaissance High School in Detroit in August 2012.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul Sancya/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President Biden greets kids during a campaign stop at Renaissance High School in Detroit in August 2012. Wearing a Detroit Tigers baseball cap, Tom Wilson says he swims here three times a week. Wilson is a big Biden guy. He has seen him speak twice and met him once. \"It's like somebody that you've known, seemingly forever,\" he said. \"Where else have you heard of a public elected official that will get on public transportation, and go from D.C. to Delaware every day? You can't get any more warm and fuzzy than that.\" Wilson, who is the sergeant-at-arms for the 14th District Democratic Party, says he's feeling good about 2020. \"In 2018, there was a blue wave,\" he said. \"Let's turn that wave into a roaring, crushing, resounding tsunami.\" But there's an undercurrent to all this. In 2016, voter turnout was 48.6% in Detroit, compared with about 51% in 2012. Hillary Clinton got 46,872 fewer votes in Detroit than Obama did in 2012, and Clinton lost Michigan to Trump by about 10,000 votes. It was the first time a Republican presidential candidate had won Michigan since 1988. Branden Snyder had a close-up view. In 2016, he led youth outreach for Clinton's campaign in Michigan. As he knocked on doors that fall, Snyder said he got the sense from many voters, especially young people, that they weren't enthusiastic about the former secretary of state. \"That started to feel deafening as it got closer to November,\" he said outside a rally last week for Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Detroit. Snyder is now executive director of a community organization called Detroit Action. The group has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders. Snyder said Warren was his first choice, but now he plans to vote for Sanders. The Vermont senator won the Michigan primary in 2016, and he has been aggressively campaigning in the state this weekend, banking on another upset win to propel his campaign forward. Snyder voted for the first time in 2008 for Obama, but his politics have evolved since then. That's in part because of issues he says the Obama years left on the table, like dealing with student loan debt and police brutality. \"So a lot of folks don't necessarily see Biden as a savior kind of candidate,\" he says. \"They see him as emblematic of all the things that went wrong or the failed promises. It's only so long he can talk about 2008 to 2016 because many of the voters were children at that time and don't have any memories of that.\" Snyder worries that if Biden doesn't rejigger his pitch, some voters will stay home again in November. Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist is trying to bridge that gap. He endorsed  Biden last week. He's also a black millennial from Detroit who voted for Sanders in the 2016 Michigan primary. Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, at center back in red tie, has endorsed Joe Biden and recently helped celebrate the opening of a field office in Detroit's Arden Park neighborhood.\n                \n                    \n                    Sam Gringlas/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, at center back in red tie, has endorsed Joe Biden and recently helped celebrate the opening of a field office in Detroit's Arden Park neighborhood. Together with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, he flipped Michigan's governor's mansion blue in 2018 by 10 points. On Friday, the lieutenant governor arrived in Detroit's Arden Park neighborhood carrying treats to celebrate the opening of a Biden field office here. \"The path to turning Michigan blue starts in neighborhoods like this one,\" he told a cheering audience of staff and volunteers. Gilchrist says in 2018, ground game and showing up in communities mattered when the votes were counted. He also says it's important to make a pitch to millennials that's not just focused on Biden's or Obama's identity, but also on what their administration achieved for young people, like health care reform. \"It was important he served alongside Obama,\" Gilchrist told NPR. \"What also matters is the substance of what he delivered for people.\" Bringing young people into the fold and letting them take some ownership of the campaign will also be critical, Gilchrist says. \"It's important for me to work with my peers, to ensure that young people of color know that they have a role to play in defining the future of this country. They have a role to play in the vice president's campaign.\" Voters like Oriana Powell. In 2016, Powell didn't vote. That fall, she was living with a friend, bouncing from place to place for the first time. Powell was working three jobs, trying to get back on her feet. On Election Day, she had car trouble and had to pick up her niece, so she just didn't make it to the polls. Powell says she didn't like Trump or Clinton and figured her vote didn't count for much anyways. \"Whether I do this or not, this country's going to run the same way, it's going to look the same way for me, so I didn't feel like it would matter,\" she said. Since Trump's election, Powell got involved with a nonprofit called Mothering Justice that organizes around issues like paid sick leave and affordable child care. The experience influenced her outlook on the political process. She calls Biden \"a wolf in sheep's clothing.\" But if he's the nominee, she'll vote for him. \"I know that one day is not all of the work,\" she says. \"It's just the tip of the iceberg, the beginning of the work.\" Powell says she's ready to cast that ballot and then get back to work.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden has a long history with Detroit, and his path to winning Michigan in the primary and in November could run through the city and its African American voters.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Joe Biden is campaigning tonight in Detroit with two former rivals. Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have endorsed the former vice president. They're joining Biden in a city where he forged deep ties during the Obama years, visiting more frequently than the former president. NPR's Sam Gringlas went to Detroit to find out whether Biden's history there factors into tomorrow's Michigan primary. SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: In front of a shiny city bus, Joe Biden rolled up his sleeves. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: I'm going to take my coat off, but that does not mean a long speech. GRINGLAS: This was 2015, and Detroit had just emerged from bankruptcy. During the recession, unemployment soared. The auto industry teetered on the brink as President Obama expanded a massive auto bailout. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: We would never, never abandon the people of Detroit.

GLORIA ROGERS: Like skiing underwater (laughter). GRINGLAS: She's voting Biden. ROGERS: We need to feel embraced. We need to feel like we did when Obama was the president - no drama Obama. Come on. GRINGLAS: Tom Wilson swims three times a week. He's a Biden guy. TOM WILSON: In 2018, there was a blue wave. Let's turn that blue wave into a roaring, crushing, resounding tsunami. GRINGLAS: There's an undercurrent to all this. In 2016, turnout in Detroit was down by over 2%. Hillary Clinton won almost 47,000 fewer votes here than Obama did in 2012. Clinton lost Michigan to Trump by about 10,000 votes. Branden Snyder had a close-up view. He led youth outreach for Clinton's campaign in Michigan. During door knocks, he noticed enthusiasm lacking.

            "article_content": "Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg dropped his White House bid on Wednesday after a disappointing performance on Super Tuesday. He's backing former Vice President Joe Biden.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: It is the morning after Super Tuesday, and the repercussions are coming quickly. Joe Biden won big. And former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg just announced he will suspend his campaign after failing to win any states last night, and we are getting word that Senator Elizabeth Warren may be rethinking her path to the nomination. Joining us now to talk through the latest news, NPR political correspondents Scott Detrow and Mara Liasson. Hi, you two. Thanks for being here. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So Mara - I want to start with you, Mara. Mike Bloomberg didn't just drop out of the race; he also endorsed Joe Biden. What kind of a difference will that make for the former vice president? LIASSON: Well, I think it will make a difference. Don't forget - the only reason that Mike Bloomberg got into the race is that, originally, he said he didn't want to run because he thought Joe Biden was strong; when he saw Joe Biden collapsing and the left-wing candidates that he thought were too far to the left to beat Donald Trump surging, that's when he got in. MARTIN: Right. LIASSON: He also said, all along, no matter who the nominee is, even if it isn't him, that he would spend whatever it took to defeat Donald Trump. So what it means for Joe Biden going forward is that Michael Bloomberg's huge wallet - you know, he's worth over $60 billion - is going to be at the disposal of the Democratic Party and Joe Biden. And that is a huge, potentially game-changing, historic thing because the out-party is always outspent by the incumbent president and his party, and that might not be the case this time. MARTIN: Right. But Scott, you've been following the Sanders campaign. I mean, can't they leverage this to their advantage, the Bloomberg-Biden connection, at this point? DETROW: I think that's something I'll be listening for going forward. It was interesting to me that, just like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders seemed very happy to rail against a multi-multi-multibillionaire who was spending a half billion dollars to hop into the race at the last moment. It was, like, a tailor-made opponent for Bernie Sanders. MARTIN: Yeah. DETROW: But over the last few days, the last week or so, it's really become just a throwaway line here or there, and Sanders has increasingly focused his attacks on Joe Biden and his long track record in the Senate, especially voting for things like the Iraq War, for things like NAFTA and other trade deals, to - and now he's airing ads in Florida and Michigan and other states voting next against Joe Biden. The Sanders campaign has increasingly calibrated all of its focus against Joe Biden, saying it was an effective two-person race. Now, increasingly, it's going to be an actual two-person race at this point... MARTIN: Yeah. DETROW: ...With Elizabeth Warren being the exception for now. MARTIN: So let's... LIASSON: Can I say... MARTIN: Yeah, go ahead, Mara. LIASSON: No, I was going to say something about those ads. The ads attacked Joe Biden for his votes on Social Security and the Iraq War and trade deals. But he also has an ad, an unusual ad for Bernie Sanders, tying himself to Barack Obama... MARTIN: I saw that. DETROW: Yeah. LIASSON: ...The guy he said wasn't progressive enough... MARTIN: Right. LIASSON: ...And didn't care about - and suggested that Obama didn't care about working-class and middle-class Americans. He's going to get a lot of grief for that. The big task... DETROW: Well... LIASSON: ...Going forward for both of these candidates is, sure, they want to beat each other, but in the end, how do they unite the party, which means appealing to each other's voters. They can't win without appealing to each other's voters. How does Sanders do that? How does Biden do that? MARTIN: Well... DETROW: And that was the first step that... MARTIN: But isn't that what he's trying to do with that ad, Scott? DETROW: I think that was the first substantive step. It's after Super Tuesday; the words are sometimes trouble. MARTIN: Substantive (laughter). DETROW: Yes, that was the word. Thank you, Rachel. It was the first step along those lines that Sanders has taken in a while in an appeal to more moderate, more - the types of voters who might be a little more OK with that establishment that Sanders blasts every day. That was a really interesting ad to me, the look-Barack-Obama-likes-me-too ad. MARTIN: Right. LIASSON: He's going to get a lot of flak for that. MARTIN: Right. But a lot of people have talked about the need for - if you want a progressive agenda in this country, that it has to come with more empathy for the other side, that it can't just be, you know, us versus them. So we'll see if that works for him moving forward. We should take a minute and talk about Elizabeth Warren because she came in third in her home state of Massachusetts. Our own Asma Khalid has confirmed that she and her team are reassessing the path forward. I mean, what happened, Mara? LIASSON: That is such a good question because Elizabeth Warren started this race with the best organization, the best political skills, the ability to tell her personal story and explain her plans in commonsense, down-to-earth language, and it just didn't take off. People who wanted a progressive candidate went to the original OG, Bernie Sanders. DETROW: (Laughter). LIASSON: And then she started bleeding votes to other candidates who appealed to liberal, college-educated Democrats like Pete Buttigieg. Some of it was gender. Some of it was strategic mistakes that she made when she came out with a plan to pay for mandatory Medicare for All without raising taxes on the middle class. Turns out she had to raise taxes on everything else that moved. I think that books will be written about what happened to Elizabeth Sanders - I'm sorry... MARTIN: Elizabeth Warren. LIASSON: ...Elizabeth Warren's wonderful campaign. MARTIN: Right. DETROW: And I don't know if necessarily her supporters would all go to Bernie Sanders if she does, in fact, drop out of this race. We have seen in the last few contests she draws a lot of support from high-income, high-education people, people who live in cities, women in particular. I don't know if that's necessarily the Sanders base. MARTIN: So just one more note on that Bernie Sanders ad and the need to build a coalition, right? I mean, we saw Joe Biden do so well with African Americans, not just in South Carolina but across the board on Super Tuesday. Clearly, Bernie Sanders feeling like that's a demographic that he needs to figure out a way to build. LIASSON: I think it's a little late. The states coming up have a lot of African Americans. The Hispanics that vote in Florida, which votes in two weeks, are not the kind of Hispanics that are going to be happy about Bernie Sanders' comments about Fidel Castro. MARTIN: Scott, final thoughts? DETROW: You know, one interesting thing that producer Barbara Sprunt and I noticed is, as the night went on, the Sanders supporters in the crowd seemed more happy, more optimistic. It's almost like having everyone against them and being the underdogs is the natural state for Sanders... LIASSON: (Laughter). DETROW: ...Not that state of being the front-runner of the past month. MARTIN: Right. We'll see how that unfolds. NPR's Scott Detrow and Mara Liasson with news that Mike Bloomberg has dropped out of the presidential race, now endorsing Joe Biden. Thanks, guys.

He swept a number of states in the biggest night of the primary season.\n                \n                    \n                    Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Joe Biden buys a pie at Buttercup Diner in Oakland, Calif., on Tuesday. He swept a number of states in the biggest night of the primary season. Momentum and timing matter in politics \u2014 and both helped former Vice President Joe Biden mount a comeback against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who went into Super Tuesday with front-runner status after significant wins in early states. After poor showings in some opening contests, Biden's campaign was seen by many as left for dead. On Tuesday he emerged as the chief alternative to Sanders. The Democratic presidential race at one point had almost two dozen candidates, but now it's essentially a contest between two men representing dueling ideological poles of the party. Sanders has energized the progressive wing with promises to transform the party and dramatically expand the government's role. Biden's pledge to fight for the \"soul of America\" has rallied centrists around him, largely focused on the question of electability against President Trump and Biden's broader ability to help congressional candidates down-ballot in 2020. \"For those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind \u2014 this is your campaign,\" Biden said to supporters in Los Angeles late Tuesday evening. Biden surge follows centrist consolidation Biden capitalized at warp speed on his big win in South Carolina's primary on Saturday. Biden went from fourth place in Iowa, fifth place in New Hampshire and a distant second in Nevada to handily winning a state with a large African American population \u2014 a constituency that is responsible for his rapid rise. That blowout forced the centrists out of the race, leaving the moderate lane to Biden. His former rivals who split the vote just a week earlier went from jabbing him on the debate stage to endorsing him and cutting ads on his behalf. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., ended their campaigns after Biden's South Carolina win and joined him on stage in Texas on Monday, the day before Super Tuesday. Biden ended up winning the state. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who dropped out of the presidential race Nov. 1, also endorsed Biden at the Texas rally. A key factor fueling Biden's rebound is that late-deciding voters broke for him by a margin of 2 to 1, according to exit polls conducted by NBC News in 12 Super Tuesday states. The former vice president faced criticism for poor debate performances, weak fundraising and weak campaign field operations in key states, but he managed to win in a range of geographic areas. Biden dominated in the South, where African Americans \u2014 a key constituency of the party \u2014 helped him carry Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee. He also won Minnesota \u2014 a state where Sanders campaigned a day before the primary. And Biden won Massachusetts, home state of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and where Sanders held a big rally over the weekend. Another reason voters likely rallied to Biden is that they viewed him as a safer choice at a time when it's clear President Trump and congressional Republicans are eager to tag all Democrats as \"socialists\" \u2014 a label Sanders uses about his own policies. Virginia freshman Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger endorsed Biden after he won her home state. She told NPR that the GOP will nationalize the race regardless of who the Democratic nominee is but said it would be better for her if Biden was the one squaring off against Trump. \"In any case, it would be desirable for me to be aligned on policy with the person at the top of the ticket because it's just one less conversation to have,\" she said Tuesday night. Sanders' anti-establishment message Sanders won the California primary, the largest state with the largest delegate haul, The Associated Press projected. He also won his home state of Vermont. Sanders also won Utah as well as Colorado, a state with a significant Latino population. Sanders referred to his camp's battle with the Democratic Party as he spoke to supporters in Essex Junction, Vt., on Tuesday night. \"We're not only taking on the corporate establishment \u2014 we're taking on the political establishment,\" he said. Sanders addresses supporters at his Super Tuesday event in Essex Junction, Vt.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sanders addresses supporters at his Super Tuesday event in Essex Junction, Vt. As he regularly does at his rallies, which often draw crowds larger than Biden's events, Sanders touted his ability to build a multigenerational, multiracial movement. His campaign repeatedly mentions his ability to draw more young and first-time voters to the ballot box, though exit polls showed lower turnout for young people. Sanders' loyal following helped position him at the top of national polls, but his big wins in the early contests of New Hampshire and Nevada also showed his strength with a range of key voting blocs such as labor, Latinos and the white working class. But that momentum was blunted once Biden won South Carolina. Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City and a Sanders supporter, told NPR that Sanders has a better chance to beat Trump in a general election because he can attract crossover voters in key states that the president won in 2016, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. \"He's got a lot he can cash in on ahead,\" de Blasio said. Biden and Sanders make different electability arguments Both Biden and Sanders stressed that their campaigns are focused on getting Trump out of office, and they each described policies they believe will attract people who aren't convinced the strong economy is translating to gains in their own lives. Biden didn't mention Sanders directly but argued Tuesday night he also had new energy that would make the difference against Trump. \"People are talking about a revolution; we started a movement. We've increased turnout. The turnout turned out for us. That can deliver us to a moment where we can do extraordinary, extraordinary things,\" he said. Sanders more directly engaged on the contrast between his record and Biden's. Without naming the former vice president, Sanders honed in on the Iraq War \u2014 an issue that has been litigated in previous Democratic primaries. Sanders proudly noted he voted against the war in Iraq, while \"another candidate\" backed it. He also argued his positions on trade, financial regulation and health care were more in line with core supporters of the party. He said he would ultimately prevail, saying, \"Tonight I tell you with absolute confidence that we are going to win the Democratic nomination and we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country.\" \"The most important person\" Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman and former mayor of New York City, was on the ballot for the first time Tuesday after skipping the first four Democratic contests. But while Bloomberg spent about $500 million of his personal fortune on the campaign, he had little to show for it. He failed to win a single state and picked up delegates in only a smattering of them. Bloomberg admitted his only path to the nomination would be through a contested convention, but as the polls started to close on Tuesday, his campaign manager had a different take. \"We'll find out whether Mike Bloomberg is on his way to becoming the candidate, or we will find out that Mike Bloomberg is going to be the most important person to whomever that candidate will be,\" Kevin Sheekey told reporters covering the wealthy philanthropist. Sheekey said the campaign would assess its plans after Tuesday's results were in. But if Bloomberg chooses to step aside as a candidate, he could play a key role helping counter the fundraising juggernaut of the Trump campaign and its allies. As much as Biden's South Carolina win revived his campaign, March 3 may mark the moment when he convinced his party to take another look at whether he's the right candidate to take on Trump in the fall. \"They don't call it Super Tuesday for nothing!\" Biden proclaimed.",

Former Vice President Joe Biden had a big night in South Carolina, showing his promised strength with black voters. If he had lost, Biden's campaign would likely have been dead. But he far exceeded expectations, with a nearly 30-point win in the state's Democratic presidential primary. \"And we are very much alive,\" Biden said during his victory speech Saturday night. Biden lives to fight another day \u2014 some would say a super day \u2014 and he helped make the case for himself as the principal alternative to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But he's still the underdog heading into Super Tuesday because of his structural disadvantages. Loading... Can he gain enough momentum from his big win to help propel him? Attempted answers to that and more, with these four takeaways: 1. It may now be a two-person race The Biden who showed up Saturday night during his victory speech in South Carolina is the Biden whom a lot of establishment and moderate Democrats were hoping to see. If he earlier made a lot of them indecisive about whether he should be the Sanders alternative \u2014 after poor finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire and his lack of a focused message \u2014 he probably reassured a lot of them Saturday to get behind him. \"It is fast emerging as a two-person race,\" Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said Saturday during NPR's live coverage. And she's not the only one. \"I think this is a two-person race right now,\" former Obama 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe said on MSNBC. \"There's only two people I think are going to accept our party's nomination. It's either Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden.\" Wealthy venture capitalist Tom Steyer dropped out Saturday night, which might help Biden's margins with black voters in the half a dozen states on Tuesday that have significant black Democratic populations. But it doesn't look like any of the other candidates crowding the moderate lane are getting out before then. Biden has to hope that moderate voters who don't want Sanders to be the nominee \u2014 and are thinking about casting their votes for former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg or Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar \u2014 reconsider and go with him. 2. Endorsements (can) still matter Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina talks with former Vice President Joe Biden at Biden's Democratic presidential primary rally in Columbia, S.C., on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Gerald Herbert/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina talks with former Vice President Joe Biden at Biden's Democratic presidential primary rally in Columbia, S.C., on Saturday. Biden got the endorsement last week of South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democratic leader in the House and the highest-ranking African American in Congress. He's venerated among Democrats in South Carolina. \"My buddy Jim Clyburn,\" Biden said during his victory speech, \"you brought me back!\" Literally. He's not joking, folks. Half of South Carolina Democratic voters said Clyburn's endorsement was an important factor in their vote \u2014 and Biden won them overwhelmingly, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research and sponsored by some of the major TV networks. Clyburn endorsed Biden on Wednesday, and 37% of voters said they made up their minds in just the last few days. Biden won them by a huge margin. Do any other bold-faced names in key states come out for Biden ahead of Super Tuesday, when he needs them most? 3. Biden has to hope he doesn't wind up too far behind on Super Tuesday Biden comes out of Saturday with the most votes out of the first four contests and is very close to Sanders in the overall delegate count. So then, why would Biden be the underdog on Super Tuesday? A few reasons: he's being badly outspent on the airwaves in the 14 Super Tuesday states; he has fewer staffers organizing on the ground; and Sanders' strength with Latinos. Sanders is spending 25 times what Biden is in Super Tuesday states \u2014 $15.5 million to $600,000, according to Advertising Analytics. To put that in context, Biden spent more on ads in South Carolina ($1 million) than across the 14 Super Tuesday states. The most critical thing about Biden's paltry Super Tuesday spending: He's not competing on the airwaves in California. California is the crown jewel of Super Tuesday, with 415 delegates, or 30% of all the delegates at stake Tuesday. Biden needs money \u2014 a lot of it \u2014 to have any hope of catching up to Sanders. Politico reported Saturday that Biden is gaining at least one major donor and that a pro-Biden super PAC raised $2.5 million Thursday. But it might be too late to make a real difference for Super Tuesday. Here's this forehead-slapping nugget from the Politico piece: It was too late, by Friday, to create a TV ad and get it on the air, according to the PAC \u2014 and it remains unclear whether the help is coming too late for Biden's campaign, which largely abandoned delegate-rich California, for example, in the run-up to Super Tuesday. Latinos are a crucial voting bloc in California and Texas. If Sanders runs up the score with them Tuesday, he's going to be tough to catch in the pledged-delegate race. 4. Sanders figures to do well on Super Tuesday, but he needs to do better with black voters to quiet the naysayers Bernie Sanders speaks during a campaign event in Massachusetts on Friday. Massachusetts is one of the states that vote on Super Tuesday. On Saturday, Sanders was in another Super Tuesday state, Virginia.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica Hill/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bernie Sanders speaks during a campaign event in Massachusetts on Friday. Massachusetts is one of the states that vote on Super Tuesday. On Saturday, Sanders was in another Super Tuesday state, Virginia. If Biden needs to do better with Latinos and the white working-class voters he also promised to do well with, then Sanders needs to do better with black voters. In Nevada, Sanders ate into Biden's margin with black voters, but that didn't happen in South Carolina. As expected, African Americans were a significant portion of the electorate Saturday night \u2014 56%. Biden won them by 44 points over Sanders, 61% to 17%. With that kind of loss with black voters, \"how can he legitimately be our nominee?\" former South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges, a Biden supporter, said of Sanders on NPR Saturday. Sanders has shown strength with younger black voters in polls, but Sanders didn't turn out young voters or new voters in South Carolina. Just 11% of the electorate was under 30, and just 19% were first-time voters. Sanders is still in the driver's seat for the nomination, but if he doesn't do better with black voters on Super Tuesday, expect Hodges' line to grow into a chorus with party stalwarts.",

James Clyburn earlier this week. Asked during this week's debate in Charleston, S.C., if he would drop out if he doesn't win the primary there, former Vice President Joe Biden was blunt. \"I will win South Carolina,\" Biden said. Asked again after the debate if he could carry on if he doesn't win South Carolina, Biden was equally declarative. \"I'm gonna win South Carolina,\" Biden said, and then for those who might not have heard, he reiterated, \"I'm gonna win South Carolina.\" No one has more riding on South Carolina than Biden. Biden led for nearly a year in national polls for the Democratic presidential nomination and by big margins in South Carolina. After disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden collapsed nationally and margins tightened in South Carolina. In the past week, Biden's lead has rebounded in South Carolina, as fears of a potential Bernie Sanders nomination are hitting fever pitch among establishment Democrats. In South Carolina, black voters are crucial, and Biden had one of his best debate performances of the cycle Tuesday night. Then, the next morning, he got the endorsement of popular longtime South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn. It was probably the best 24 hours Biden has had since voting began in the nominating contest and was a much-needed shot in the arm for his candidacy. But the candidate who staked his claim in the race as the most electable hasn't won anything yet \u2014 making South Carolina must-win for Biden. The stakes are especially high for Biden, as he jockeys to be the principal alternative to Sanders, because his campaign is running on fumes \u2014 trailing badly in ad spending and organization in those crucial Super Tuesday states that vote just three days after South Carolina. A shrinking coalition Biden dismissed losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the Democratic nominating process, because they are overwhelmingly white states and don't represent the entire country. Never mind that Biden held leads in both states in an average of the polls, just days and weeks before both contests. Never mind that Biden has touted his ability not to win just black voters, but also white, working-class voters. Al Hightower (in blue hat), a Joe Biden supporter, stands in line for early voting for the Democratic presidential primary at the Richland County Election Commission on Thursday in Columbia, S.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Al Hightower (in blue hat), a Joe Biden supporter, stands in line for early voting for the Democratic presidential primary at the Richland County Election Commission on Thursday in Columbia, S.C. But Biden lost white voters without a college degree in all three of the first states, finishing behind Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg in Iowa and Nevada. In New Hampshire, he finished behind Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, too, with the group. Biden has won just an average of 13% of whites without a degree, including 13% of white men without a degree and 14% of women, according to entrance and exit polls. The number with women is especially surprising, considering that severely underperformed his standing in national polls before the contests began. In the December NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, Biden's strongest support came from white women without a college degree \u2014 34% said Biden was their choice versus 17% for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 13% for Sanders and 10% for Buttigieg. Here's how the candidates have done with groups since voting began: White, no college White men, no college White women, no college Biden also said he would fare better when the electorate became more diverse, but in Nevada, the first state with significant black and Latino populations, Sanders won Latinos overwhelmingly. Sanders won half of Latinos (50%), and Biden finished a distant second with them, more than 30 points behind (17%). If the Vermont senator runs up the score with Latinos again on Super Tuesday in California and Texas, there may be no catching him in the pledged-delegate race. Biden did win black voters in Nevada, but only by a 38%-to-28% margin over Sanders. Wealthy businessman Tom Steyer finished third with a sizable 17%. Incidentally, the spread in the average of the polls in South Carolina is not that far off from those entrance polls in Nevada. Biden holds a 34%-to-22% lead over Sanders with Steyer third with 14%. In 2016, South Carolina was more than 60% black. Super Tuesday woes Biden hopes a win in South Carolina will propel him to a good day on Super Tuesday, March 3. But that might be more difficult than it sounds. Biden's campaign is not in a position to fully capitalize on any potential momentum out of South Carolina. His campaign has spent just over $600,000 on television and digital advertising in Super Tuesday states, according to data from Advertising Analytics provided to NPR. His campaign has only been on TV in six of the 14 states that vote on Super Tuesday \u2014 Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Texas, Alabama and Arkansas. Those happen to be the states with the highest percentages of black voters as shares of the Democratic electorates. Black voters are undoubtedly important in a Democratic nominating contest, but with Sanders expanding his coalition, it's going to take more than African American voters to get Biden over the finish line to be the nominee. In California, Super Tuesday's crown jewel of delegates, the Biden campaign has only spent roughly $4,000 on digital ads. By comparison, Sanders has spent more than $15 million on Super Tuesday states, including $7 million in California and $4 million in Texas, the states with the two biggest delegate hauls on Super Tuesday. California and Texas account for almost half of all delegates at stake that day. Bigger than Sanders, though, Biden is competing for moderate voters with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Buttigieg and Klobuchar. Putting aside Bloomberg, whose level of personal spending has never been seen before in a presidential election, both Klobuchar and Buttigieg are far outspending Biden on the airwaves and on digital. Klobuchar and a super PAC supporting her have spent more than $4 million. Buttigieg has spent nearly $3 million. Top Super Tuesday ad spenders In addition to ad spending, Biden is lagging in organization. According to NBC News, Biden has about 500 staffers on the ground in Super Tuesday states, compared with 1,300 for Warren, 1,000 for Sanders and at least 950 for Bloomberg. All those obstacles make Biden an underdog for the nomination, which is why he needs South Carolina to have any hopes of staging a comeback. He likely needs to win by a wide margin to be able to juice all the free media he can get \u2014 plus some outside help \u2014 ahead of the biggest day of the campaign yet, Super Tuesday.",

It would be overstating it to describe the mood as grim, but it's certainly sober. Here is newly elected State Senator Nathan Johnson trying to fire up the gathered supporters. NATHAN JOHNSON: No question, he's the best, and the nation needs Joe Biden. And the thing that I find a little frustrating is I thought it was going to be easy. Joe Biden needs us, so the nation needs us to put Joe Biden in office. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING) GOODWYN: Across town, Mike Bloomberg's headquarters is dark and locked at 10 a.m. on a Sunday morning, my car the only one in a big, empty parking lot. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING) GOODWYN: A bleary-eyed 30-something-year-old organizer comes to the door, the 12-hour workday showing on his face. Since he was hired on January 15, Cary Billings has not had one day off. Nearly 40 paid staff are in North Texas working for Mayor Bloomberg. CARY BILLINGS: We have 19 field offices across the state, so we're making the most significant investment in the state of Texas that we have seen in modern presidential history, so we're making really good headway. We feel really confident about what we're building here, not only in Texas but across the nation. SAHARE WAZIRALI: In a small house in a working-class neighborhood in East Dallas, Sahare Wazirali trains volunteers who are here to canvass for Elizabeth Warren. WAZIRALI: Awesome. OK, so we're at the same spot now. So, basically, this is the list of addresses that we will be contacting. GOODWYN: It's cool and misting outside, but a steady stream of women, young and not so young, walk up the sidewalk and knock on the front door with the big Warren sign. MELISSA ODOM: Yeah. This is the first time that I've done anything like this. GOODWYN: Melissa Odom's (ph) installed the Warren canvassing app on her cell, familiarized herself with the script somewhat and is nervously standing outside, about to go knock on doors by herself. WAZIRALI: Awesome. How are you feeling? Feel good? ODOM: Yeah. WAZIRALI: You're going to do amazing. GOODWYN: Odom quietly stole away from her house to volunteer for Warren. ODOM: I did sneak out of the house. My husband voted Trump last time. He is a staunch Republican. We have very few political debates because it always ends up in a fight. So, yeah, I just told him today - I said I have somewhere I need to go. Plus, I said, I'm actually not going to tell you where I'm going. We'll debate it when we get back (laughter). So, yeah, he does not know where I am, but whatever. GOODWYN: The latest polls in Texas have Mayor Buttigieg in single digits. But like Warren and Sanders, his supporters tend to be very enthusiastic. But if you want to find enthusiastic supporters, all you had to do was watch Bernie Sanders swing through Texas on the night of his Nevada caucus victory. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie. GOODWYN: In El Paso, San Antonio and Austin, his rallies were packed to the gunwales with Democrats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Senator Bernie Sanders. (CHEERING) BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you, San Antonio. (CHEERING) SANDERS: Don't tell anybody. I don't want to get them nervous. We're going to win the Democratic primary in Texas. (CHEERING) GOODWYN: As much attention has been paid to the first four Democratic contests, the delegates awarded in Texas are a third larger than those four states combined. If their campaigns are to continue, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg must close the gap and win a good share of those Lone Star delegates. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas.

            "article_content": "The finishing tally in New Hampshire looks a lot like that of in Iowa, with Bernie Sanders on top and Pete Buttigieg a close second. But there were some surprises further down the results.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: A week ago at this time, we were wondering who had actually won the Iowa caucuses. Today we can definitively say which candidate was the winner in New Hampshire - Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg was a close second. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: That may sound like the result from the Iowa caucuses, but there were some surprises. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar finished third, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren fourth and former Vice President Joe Biden, who left New Hampshire before the voting ended, came in fifth. Let's take a moment now to talk about what this means and what to expect next. And to do that, we're joined by NPR senior political editor Domenico Montanaro. Welcome back. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there. CORNISH: Let's start with the victor of the night, Bernie Sanders, capturing about 26% of the votes, roughly the same as in Iowa. What have you learned from that? MONTANARO: Well, you wouldn't say there's a front-runner in this race, but if you're Bernie Sanders, you got to feel pretty good. I mean, he's certainly got the advantage right now over the field because the center-left of the party hasn't coalesced around anyone. You know, he's taking the very liberal lane all to himself, especially considering, as you noted up there, Warren falling to a disappointing fourth place. She finished with less than 10% of the vote, and she's a neighboring senator. Still, overall, I have to say 26% - not great - you know, certainly not enough to win the nomination at that rate. He has to show he now can expand beyond his base of voters who are under 30 and people who consider themselves very liberal. CORNISH: We've been hearing on the program about Democratic voters torn between these moderates, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. Is that what you see in their second- and third-place finishes? MONTANARO: Well, I mean, Buttigieg and Klobuchar are facing critical tests now coming up in Nevada and South Carolina. They haven't demonstrated that they have wide appeal with voters of color at all, and those states are much more diverse electorates. In 2016, Nevada was more than 40% nonwhite, and 61% of South Carolina Democratic voters in the primary were African American. But look. It's not just Buttigieg and Klobuchar that the moderates or pragmatic voters in this race are torn between. I mean, add into that mix Biden, Tom Steyer, who is also competing very heavily in South Carolina, and, you know, Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who's sitting out there with his hundreds of millions of dollars on ads that he's spent. And he's about to become a very real factor in this race over the next few weeks - on March 3, the Super Tuesday states, which hold about a third of the delegates overall in this race. CORNISH: Now, correct me if I'm wrong. Nevada and their caucuses are next, and yet we heard last night former Vice President Joe Biden in South Carolina making his case to voters of color. Here he is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: You can't be the Democratic nominee and you can't win a general election as a Democrat unless you have overwhelming support from black and brown voters. It's just really simple. No. It's a natural fact. It's true. CORNISH: Help us understand why he's staking his claim there. MONTANARO: Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and former Democratic National Committee chairman, said on our - air last night during our live coverage that South Carolina is Biden's Waterloo and that if he doesn't do well there, it's over. And I think that's a hundred percent accurate. The theory of the case for Biden has been shredded in half already. He said he could win white working-class voters. He hasn't. And his last hope is saying that he can win black voters. If he doesn't do that, he has no path to continue. CORNISH: Turnout overall - how did it compare in New Hampshire? MONTANARO: Yeah. Look. Democrats rebounded and set a turnout record last night in New Hampshire. More than 295,000 people cast ballots, higher than 2008, good sign for the party - wants to show it's fired up and ready to go, to borrow a phrase against Trump. But I have a feeling we're going to have a whole lot more data points as this delegate race continues. CORNISH: That's NPR senior political editor Domenico Montanaro. Thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "The New Hampshire primary is Tuesday, and Democrats want a less dramatic outcome than last week. They're also looking for bigger turnout, since Iowa's contest signaled potentially soft enthusiasm.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: And I'm Ari Shapiro in Manchester, N.H., where people have been voting all day in the first primary contest of 2020. For more on what to watch for tonight here in New Hampshire - other than whether we will actually get results - we are joined by NPR's Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: OK. So we have to remind people once again - just like in Iowa, there's not a lot of delegates on the line tonight. Nobody is coming close to getting the nomination yet. So what is important as we watch this race and the results that are going to be coming in? LIASSON: One thing that's important is turnout. That's pretty basic. Overall turnout was about 250,000 votes for Democrats in the 2016 primary, and turnout is a measure of enthusiasm. And it's also Bernie Sanders' electability argument. He says that he can turn out - bring millions of new voters into the process. He couldn't do that in Iowa, where turnout was disappointingly flat; it was about the same as 2016. He managed to get a tiny uptick in the 18-to-29-year-old vote - about 30% - but they're only 1% of the electorate. So we'll see if he can do that tonight. We'll also find out if Bernie Sanders is a strong front-runner. He did the same in Iowa as he did in 2016. He tied for first place. But in New Hampshire, he has a tough act to follow - his own - because he beat Hillary Clinton by 22 points in 2016, and he's been leading in the polls all along. So one question tonight is, how close will Mayor Pete Buttigieg finish behind Sanders, who has clearly consolidated the left wing of his party? SHAPIRO: If Sanders has clearly consolidated the left wing of his party, the center-left of the party is a little less clear. What are you looking for there? LIASSON: A lot less clear. Ever since the guy who was supposed to be the most electable, Joe Biden, came in a disappointing fourth in Iowa, the big question is whether Democrats would consolidate around a center-left candidate - an alternative to Bernie Sanders - and who would that be? Right now Buttigieg is the strongest competitor against Sanders. But he appeared to lose some ground in recent days to Amy Klobuchar since the last debate, but Klobuchar has a lot of ground to make up. And Elizabeth Warren, who was trying to present herself as a kind of unifying balance between the center-left and the left, has made just enough big strategic errors to slip into a battle for third place. And that's not good for a senator from next-door Massachusetts. So the bottom line question is - will we get more clarity after tonight, or will a lot of candidates continue slogging forward? And that really worries Democrats because they are desperate to unify and get going in the battle against Trump. SHAPIRO: I want to ask you about another candidate slogging forward who has not competed in these first two states but who has spent a lot of money. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is facing some fresh scrutiny today. What's going on? LIASSON: Yes, a lot of scrutiny. There's tape of him saying that, back in the '90s, we put cops in minority neighborhoods because that's where all the crime was. Of course, black leaders will tell you that's also where the victims of crime were. But that policy had the unintended consequence of arresting more black kids for marijuana than white kids. And that is going to be a real issue for him in this primary. SHAPIRO: So given how fractured the race is, who's going to take advantage of this, do you think? LIASSON: Well, Bloomberg's relationship with the black community is clearly going to be part of the big battle in the primary, especially when you get to Super Tuesday states with large numbers of African American voters. His competitors will draw attention to it. But right now, the person really working this is Donald Trump. He tweeted that Bloomberg is a total racist, kind of just like he used the 1994 crime bill against Hillary Clinton to great effect. He is now trying to use it against Bloomberg. He's not just tearing Democrats down; he's also trying to boost Bernie Sanders. Here's what he said about the muddled Iowa results at a rally he held last night in New Hampshire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think they're trying to take it away from Bernie again. I think Bernie came in second. Can you believe it? They're doing it to you again, Bernie. They're doing it to you again. LIASSON: So he's clearly trying to appeal to Sanders voters. A lot of them are in his white working-class demographic. He wants them to be upset and angry at the Democratic establishment. He's trying to create as much discord and disarray within the Democratic primary as he can, at the same time, undermining whoever might emerge as a threat to him. SHAPIRO: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson on this day of the New Hampshire primaries. Thanks, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President-elect Biden has reportedly choosen his secretary of state. President Trump has still not conceded the election. Plus, the U.S. recorded a million new COVID-19 cases in just six days.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: All right. Joe Biden is starting to put together his Cabinet. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Multiple news organizations say the president-elect has chosen an experienced former State Department official to be his secretary of state. Tony Blinken held the No. 2 State Department post in the Obama administration. He favors strong international alliances. It is thought that Blinken would be easier to confirm than some other possible nominees. The Senate approved his previous diplomatic job by a vote of 55 to 38. GREENE: And we have NPR's Michele Kelemen here. She covers the State Department and joins us to talk about this move. Good morning, Michele. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So what should we know about Tony Blinken? KELEMEN: Well, he's a 58-year-old former deputy secretary of state, but most of all, he's someone who's spent a lot of time with Joe Biden over the years, both in the White House and in Congress. You know, I remember going to briefings with Biden when he was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Blinken was always there. He traveled with Biden. He was a close adviser back then. So if he is confirmed as the next secretary of state, his counterparts abroad will know that he has a very long history with the president-elect. He's a safe pick. He's polished, and he knows the State Department well. GREENE: Well, what do you think this pick tells us? I mean, beyond this being someone who knows Biden well and that they have that long relationship, what does it tell us about the president-elect's goals when it comes to foreign policy? KELEMEN: I think it signals kind of a more traditional approach to foreign policy and diplomacy, also maybe human rights. You know, on Twitter, he raised concerns recently about a conflict in Ethiopia. And last week, he put out a much tougher statement than the State Department did about Egypt arresting high-profile human rights activists. Blinken also talks a lot about restoring U.S. leadership, especially when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Here he is earlier this year at the Meridian International Center talking about how a Biden administration would, for instance, restore funding to the World Health Organization. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANTONY BLINKEN: A Biden administration would do the opposite of what the Trump administration has done in terms of pulling back from our leadership in international organizations, institutions, alliances. KELEMEN: He talks about how the U.S. needs partners to deal with China, which he calls a competitor. And on Iran, he said it was a mistake for the Trump administration to leave the nuclear deal. A Biden administration would rejoin if Iran gets back into compliance. Those are just a few of the things that he's talked about. GREENE: And it sounds like it's not just Blinken. I mean, we're getting a fuller picture of President-elect Biden's foreign policy team. KELEMEN: Right. I mean, Jake Sullivan is a top candidate to be U.S. national security adviser. He actually played a key role in opening up a back channel to Iran that led to the negotiations on that Iran nuclear deal. More recently, he's been involved in this project to get a better sense of how U.S. foreign policy can help middle-class Americans. Another name that we're hearing, not a household name but a very familiar one to the State Department, is Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Several news organizations say she'll be tapped to be the ambassador to the United Nations. And that, David, would really be a signal to career foreign service officers who have been sidelined by the Trump administration. Thomas-Greenfield, who's Black, was in the Foreign Service for 35 years, and she was one of many who was kind of forced out by the Trump administration. GREENE: NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen. Michele, thanks as always. KELEMEN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. So as the incoming president makes personnel moves, the departing president does as well. INSKEEP: His constantly changing legal team distanced itself from a conspiracy theorist. Sidney Powell started a press conference last week spinning out wild theories about George Soros and Hugo Chavez. The departing president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, introduced Sidney Powell. But after the embarrassing reaction, Giuliani now says in a statement she's not part of the Trump team. Giuliani apparently still is part of the Trump team and suffered absolute defeat in court over the weekend in Pennsylvania. The president has lost virtually all court challenges, and a few more key Republicans have now abandoned the departing president as he tries to overturn a Democratic election. GREENE: And we have NPR's Franco Ordo\u00f1ez here with us. He covers the White House. Franco, good morning. FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So Pennsylvania, the state that put Biden over the top to win the election, as Steve mentioned, another legal defeat there for President Trump over the weekend. Bring us up to speed. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Yeah. President Trump's campaign had sought to block the certification of Pennsylvania's election results. You know, they allege that Republicans had been disadvantaged - illegally that is - because some counties allowed voters to fix errors on their mail-in ballots. But a federal judge dismissed that case, saying it would disenfranchise millions of voters. And the judge wrote this really scathing decision saying the plaintiff, Trump's team that is, came without factual proof. Trump's campaign says that it will appeal, but the deadline for Pennsylvania to certify is today. And just to note, Biden won there by more than 80,000 votes. GREENE: Well, despite that fact, I mean, a lot of Republicans are remaining quiet and not calling on President Trump to admit the obvious, that he lost. But you did have Republican Senator Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania after this decision now coming out and calling for the president to concede. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Yeah. He released a statement soon after the ruling saying President Trump has exhausted all plausible legal options to challenge the result in Pennsylvania. He went on to congratulate President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and said that Trump should move forward with the transition process in order to protect his legacy. Toomey is a Republican. He is retiring in two years, but he's joining a small number of Republican senators who said Trump needs to concede. Trump was also criticized by Chris Christie, an ally of his. Here he is on ABC yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS CHRISTIE: I've been a supporter of the president. I voted for him twice. But elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Still, most Republicans are trying to thread that needle, saying Biden should go ahead and in many cases get transition resources but also Trump should be able to pursue all legal avenues. GREENE: I mean - but you just listen to Toomey, though, saying that the president has exhausted all plausible legal options. You have Christie there saying you can't continue to act as if something here happened that didn't happen. Beyond lying and saying that fraud exists that doesn't, what are the president's options here to go forward? The window's basically closing, right? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Yeah. Time is running out. In Georgia, results have already been certified by the Republican state leadership. But on Saturday night, Trump's campaign said it's requesting a recount. This would be the third time those 5 million ballots will be counted. I mentioned the certification deadline in Pennsylvania. That's today. And Michigan's canvassing board also meets today when the election results are expected to be certified. Biden won Michigan by 150,000 votes. Trump's campaign has sought to overturn those results as well. And we'll remember, Trump invited those Michigan Republicans to the White House in a pressure offensive. GREENE: NPR's Franco Ordo\u00f1ez. Franco, thank you so much. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: I mean, this is just startling. The United States recorded a million new coronavirus cases in just a matter of six days. INSKEEP: This country has now seen more than 12 million documented COVID infections. And as cases keep surging, public health experts are urging Americans to stay home this Thanksgiving holiday. Some relief could be around the corner with newly approved treatments, maybe even vaccines, which have looked very good in tests. But it will be many months before all Americans can be vaccinated. GREENE: And NPR's Allison Aubrey joins us this morning. Hi, Allison. ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: I mean, the surge is just getting scarier by the day. What is the latest? AUBREY: Yeah. As we head into this holiday week, it's a very grim picture, David. We're averaging 170,000 new cases a day, a 60% increase compared to just two weeks ago. Deaths are averaging about 1,200 per day and rising. That's nearly a person dying from COVID every minute in the U.S. I spoke to former CDC director Tom Frieden about this surge. TOM FRIEDEN: It's shocking. We're losing the equivalent of a 9/11 attack every three days in the U.S. And what, frankly, scares me is that Thanksgiving could become the Super Bowl of superspreading events. AUBREY: You know, it just doesn't take much, David. All you need is one asymptomatic person in your gathering to start a round of infections. The CDC now says most coronavirus cases are, in fact, spread by people without symptoms. GREENE: Well - and the CDC is just bluntly saying, don't travel this holiday season. Do you think people are listening? AUBREY: You know, I bet people are rethinking their plans, especially travel. But a survey out from the University of Michigan this morning finds that 1 in 3 people polled say the benefits of gathering with family for the holidays are worth the risk of spreading or getting the virus. I should point out the survey was completed before the CDC advisory. But, you know, it just shows the temptation to gather, David. People want to see family. I certainly would like to, too. But as Tom Frieden says, better to have a Zoom Thanksgiving than an ICU Christmas. GREENE: Yeah. I mean, a Zoom Thanksgiving is different, but at least for this year, it might be what we have to do, obviously. Let me ask you, Allison. I mean, you have a president-elect who during a campaign said that tackling this pandemic is just a top priority. What do we know about how prepared Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are to take action when they come into office? AUBREY: You know, they say they're going to be ready on day one. But the health experts advising the Biden-Harris team say they need access to the career scientists, to their data, to help this new administration transition smoothly, especially when it comes to all the real-time data on the pandemic and vaccine distribution planning. It's a monumental task, David, with very complicated logistics. I spoke to ER physician Rob Rodriguez of UC San Francisco. He is one of Biden's advisers. ROBERT RODRIGUEZ: The current administration needs to step up. They really need to think about the health of the American people and start granting us full access. AUBREY: The president-elect himself has been saying lives are at risk. And Dr. Rodriguez says that one of the biggest challenges when it comes to a vaccine is the hesitancy among people. With more promising vaccine news, including new information out on the effectiveness of another vaccine, the Oxford U-AstraZeneca vaccine, this is all top of mind. So the Biden team is definitely thinking ahead to a vaccine education strategy. It's a big job to answer people's questions, make them feel comfortable getting it on top of the logistics of actually distributing it. GREENE: Monumental task, as you say. NPR's Allison Aubrey. Allison, thank you so much. AUBREY: Thank you, David. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

We've already heard the beginnings of Joe Biden's foreign policy priorities. How different is his approach to his predecessor? KELEMEN: Well, I think it's what you heard Admiral Stavridis talk about. The big priority is rebuilding alliances. That's why we're hearing kind of a sigh of relief in a lot of places, in Europe, for instance. Rejoining the Paris climate accord, the World Health Organization, a return to a kind of more multilateral approach to the world. But he's also talked about a foreign policy that benefits the American middle class. And, you know, there was this group of foreign policy experts, some close to Biden, who went to Nebraska, Colorado and Ohio, recently, to hear the views of Americans. They found there, you know, a lot of support for Trump's tough talk about China but also a pragmatic view about trade, immigration and dealing with China, you know? They want trade deals that protect American jobs, global leadership but also not an overextended America. So I think some of those themes are going to be important for a Joe Biden presidency. INSKEEP: Let me ask about the way that President Trump has embraced strongmen - remarkably, remarkably deferential to Russia's Vladimir Putin, said he's friends with President Xi Jinping of China even as he launched a trade war against him, the relationship with the leader of North Korea. We could go on and on. He was criticized for this. And yet every U.S. president tries to manage relations with various strongmen around the world, hopefully, in the interest of peace. How, if at all, would Biden be any different? KELEMEN: Right. Well, I mean, Biden does have close personal relationships with a lot of leaders, but you're not going to see Biden praising Vladimir Putin. You will see him working together with Putin to extend new start, an arms control agreement with Russia. You won't see Biden exchanging love letters with Kim Jong Un, but you will see him trying to get denuclearization talks going on the Korean Peninsula. Saudi Arabia is another one to watch, Steve, you know? Trump went there on his first overseas trip. Biden has made clear that he's going to pull back U.S. aid to the Saudi military campaign in Yemen, for instance, and raise human rights concerns more than Trump did. Progressives in the Democratic Party are going to be pushing him to do more of that. INSKEEP: OK. Frank Langfitt in London, the U.K., of course, is the closest ally the United States has had or has been. Boris Johnson is somebody very much in sympathy with President Trump and has a similar political approach. How has Boris Johnson taken his personal ally's defeat? LANGFITT: Well, he offered congratulations and mentioned the - what they call the special relationship here. And he talked about ability - you know, an ability to look at trade, security, working on climate change, just like the admiral and just like Michele were mentioning. We are going to have the major climate change meeting coming up in Glasgow next year. So that will be an opportunity for them to work together. But, obviously, Boris Johnson, very close to President Trump by comparison. And so that's a little awkward. INSKEEP: Do we know how Joe Biden feels about Boris Johnson? LANGFITT: Yeah, we get the sense he's not a fan at all. I think this could be a big reversal of fortune, not so much necessarily for Britain writ large but definitely for Boris Johnson. So last year, Joe Biden referred to president - referred to Boris Johnson as kind of a physical and emotional clone of President Trump. And back in 2016, when a bust of Churchill was removed from the Oval Office, Johnson suggested it might be part of the Kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the British Empire. So he may have regretted writing that, frankly, now. And, also, Biden - it's interesting. Biden is of Irish descent. He's also warned Johnson in his negotiations with the EU not to do anything that could threaten the peace agreement in Northern Ireland. And this evening, there was an exchange between a BBC reporter and President-elect Biden. And it went like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NICK BRYANT: Mr. Biden, a quick word for the BBC. JOE BIDEN: The BBC. I'm Irish. LANGFITT: I'm Irish. Now, he was smiling when he said that. But it's just - you get a sense of here is a new kind of leader with maybe a little bit of a different relationship with Boris Johnson and maybe a little different view of the United Kingdom. INSKEEP: Irish and the British haven't always gotten along, to say the least. Rob, in - (laughter). LANGFITT: No, historically, they have not, Steve. There's a bitter, bitter history. And I spent a lot of time in Ireland, and everybody there remembers it quite clearly. INSKEEP: Very briefly, Rob, what is the response in Germany to this news? SCHMITZ: I think it's fair to say German as well as many European leaders are collectively exhaling a sigh of relief today. President Trump has been a thorn in the side of Berlin from day one, whether it was his constant badgering of Germany to spend more on national defense or billions of dollars' worth of tariffs on German exports or his removal of the U.S. from the Paris climate accord or the Iran nuclear deal, he was likely the most difficult U.S. president Germany has had to deal with in the post-war era. The most recent Pew survey showed that just 10% of Germans were confident in Trump's handling of world affairs. INSKEEP: And what can change, though? I mean, there are - you know? There are differences between Germany and the United States, differences over NATO, lots of things. SCHMITZ: Right. I think, you know, a return to civility is going to be one change, you know? The tone of transatlantic dialogue will immediately change. I think we'll also see an eagerness by both sides to get back to work on problems that the two nations have in common to search for common solutions. I spoke to Constanze Stelzenmuller about this. She's a senior fellow at Brookings. And here's what she said. CONSTANZE STELZENMULLER: Biden is never going to call the EU a foe. Biden is going to look at the EU and say this is a very useful source of leverage and additional power in dealing with issues that are important to America. INSKEEP: OK. So that is one perspective from Europe. But while I have Rob Schmitz and Frank Langfitt, I want to ask about one more country. And I want people who don't recall that - both of you have covered China. Both of you speak Chinese and know the country very well. And this is the most important relationship in the world. It's been difficult for one American president after another. And President Trump had a particular approach. What changes now? SCHMITZ: Well, Steve, we just heard from Constanze Stelzenmuller talking about issues that are important to America for Europe. And one of those big issues is going to be dealing with a more powerful and aggressive China. Both the U.S. and the EU have been trying to tackle this issue the past four years. But Trump made it very difficult by driving a wedge between the U.S. and Germany as well as the European Union. Suddenly, all parties were dealing with China separately, which benefited Beijing greatly. And now it looks like we're going to have alliance with the EU and America that will be facing China. INSKEEP: Frank Langfitt, about 30 seconds here. LANGFITT: Yeah, I think that what Biden will be hoping for is to work with the EU to still continue a very assertive policy but one that is far more strategic than what President Trump has been pursuing. INSKEEP: And I suppose we should mention this is something that foreign policy experts have talked about, the possibility of the United States gaining leverage on a resistant China by gaining alliances. The Obama administration attempted something called the Trans-Pacific Partnership with Pacific allies. And there is now talk of a stronger, more coordinated effort between the United States and the European Union to confront China and try to continue to set the rules of the world.

            "article_content": "President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden are set for the first of three presidential debates. Tuesday's debate will be in Cleveland.  TONYA MOSLEY, HOST: The first presidential debate of the general election is tonight. And President Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will be face-to-face in Cleveland, Ohio, potentially a key state for their first prime-time bout. We've got two of our prime-time journalists here with us - NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid. Hello to you both. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi there. MOSLEY: So we heard a little from both of the campaigns today previewing some of their lines of attack. What have we heard from them? Let's start with you, Tam. KEITH: Yeah. So the Trump campaign released a list of 17 questions, including on the Supreme Court and trade. But on the top of the list was a question about Biden's son Hunter and some of his work overseas. And that gives a hint of where they're headed. Trump has also been making other personal attacks, like reviving a baseless attack that he used on Hillary Clinton in 2016. He's saying that Biden may be on performance-enhancing drugs. He even talked about this from the White House briefing room on Sunday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: People say he was on performance-enhancing drugs. A lot of people have said that. A lot of people have written that. So take a look at it. Take a look. Why don't you just check - you can check out the Internet. You'll see plenty of people say it. And whether he is or not doesn't matter. But I would love to take a test, and he can take a test, too. KEITH: His team is also complaining that Biden's team won't agree to an inspection of earpieces, which is just another baseless theory bouncing around on the right-wing Internet. MOSLEY: Wow. Asma, what about on the Biden side? KHALID: Well, I will say in contrast, you know, I don't think that what we're hearing from Biden's campaign is as personal as it is sort of policy-driven. Biden's campaign held a call for reporters today with a couple of his advisers, and it's clear that they're really hoping to hammer the president on the pandemic. Democrats have felt for months that COVID-19 and the fact that there are now more than 200,000 people in the United States who have died from the virus has really exposed the president's poor leadership. And then the other issue I anticipate that we'll likely hear tonight is about President Trump's taxes. It is not officially on the list of topics for tonight, but it is something that Biden's campaign has been eager to play up after revelations in The New York Times that Trump paid very little to no federal income taxes over the last 17 years as he suffered some pretty big business losses. Tonya, I will also point out that just hours before the debate tonight, Biden released his tax returns from 2019, showing that he paid about $300,000 in federal taxes. And I will say it seems like a very clear attempt to depict a contrast on this issue, and that issue of contrast is something that we did hear from Biden's deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield on a press call today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KATE BEDINGFIELD: President Trump only sees the world from Park Avenue. He looks out for the stock market but looks down on workers and middle-class families struggling to get by. KHALID: And really, this idea of taxes, they feel, sort of exemplifies this contrast that they've been trying to play up in recent weeks that this race is about Scranton versus Park Avenue, where Joe Biden represents the common man, in their view, and that Donald Trump represents more of the ultra-elite. KEITH: Yeah. Hillary Clinton brought up Trump's taxes in 2016 in the debates. At the time, there were only a few returns out, and they were related to his applications for a casino license. And she said at the time it appeared he had paid no federal taxes. And his response, just as it is now, is to say, well, he pays other taxes - so does everyone else - and that avoiding tax payments is just smart. You know, like, he's just working the system. I anticipate that he might try to turn this on Biden in the same way he turned it on Clinton by saying, hey, Biden has been in the government for a long time. He was involved. He voted on the current tax code - and saying that, well, maybe Biden would even raise your taxes. KHALID: And to be clear, Biden's plan - he has been quite clear about this - would only anticipate raising taxes on people who make over $400,000 - so aimed at the more elite population. MOSLEY: Yeah, the more wealthy - Tam, the president says he hasn't been preparing for much tonight. What do you make of that? KEITH: Well, you know, debates are about expectations, and he might be trying to set the bar for himself a little on the low side. He has downplayed his debate prep. On Sunday, he held a surprise press briefing, which was attended by two of the people involved in his debate preparation - former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We had a little debate prep before we came here. I think this whole thing, though, is debate prep. You know, what I do is debate prep every day. I'm taking questions from you people all the time. KEITH: The president doesn't like the traditional debate prep, or at least he doesn't like to cop to it - the idea of someone playing his opponent. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, I recently spoke with Philippe Reines, who played Trump during Hillary Clinton's debate prep. MOSLEY: Yeah. KEITH: And he told me he didn't know who will be playing Trump this time, but he had recently taken his ill-fitting Trump suit and shoes over to someone who works with the Biden team. MOSLEY: Oh, my gosh. So Asma, has the Biden campaign been using that outfit to prepare? KHALID: Well, candidly, Tonya, I do not know. But what I do know is that Biden has been holed up doing debate prep for the last few days. You know, he has had a very limited public schedule, not much travel. And what is interesting is that, you know, originally, Joe Biden himself emphasized that in debating President Trump, who is known to often tell falsehoods, he felt that in order to be successful, he just needed to tell the truth - you know, that he would essentially be fact-checking the president. But today the campaign set expectations, making it very clear that they don't see fact-checking as part of what Biden needs to do tonight. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SYMONE SANDERS: It is not Joe Biden's job in this debate to fact-check Donald Trump. That's the moderator's job. That's the independent press's job. Joe Biden will be speaking to folks at home. He'll be speaking directly to the American people. KHALID: That's one of Biden's advisers, Symone Sanders. And we should point out, also, that we've gotten a sense that the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, will also not be fact-checking. So, you know, a lot of that job is going to be left up to journalists or, you know, I would say folks on either side of the aisle who are following this debate. MOSLEY: And Tam, in the 30 seconds we have left, what are both sides hoping for this evening? KEITH: For President Trump, he is currently down in the polls, so he will want to use his unpredictable debate style to throw Biden off his game and somehow change the trajectory of this race, which has been very locked in. And it's the flip side for Joe Biden, who will want to keep the race as stable as it's been. He is in the polling lead. MOSLEY: That's NPR's Tamara Keith and Asma Khalid. Thanks to both of you. KEITH: You're welcome. MOSLEY: And we'll have live coverage of the debate on NPR and NPR.org. The debate begins at 9 p.m. Eastern. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Kamala Harris stands with former Vice President Joe Biden after speaking last month during the Democratic National Convention. Two days after The New York Times published reporting on several years of President Trump's recent tax returns, Democratic nominee Joe Biden released his 2019 return and financial disclosures. The 2019 tax return from Biden and his wife, Jill, shows taxable income of $944,737 and a federal tax bill of $299,346. Their 2019 financial disclosure shows about $250,000 in income from book deals, speeches and the University of Pennsylvania, where Biden's a professor. The disclosure shows less than $100,000 in debt. Biden released the return and disclosure just hours before the first presidential debate, where Trump is expected to face questions over his tax returns. In a call with reporters Tuesday, the Biden campaign said the former vice president has now released 22 years of tax returns. Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, and her husband, Doug Emhoff, also released their 2019 tax return and financial disclosure Tuesday, marking 15 years of Harris' returns now available to the public. Harris and Emhoff reported $3,018,127 in taxable income and paid $1,185,628 in taxes. Trump has notably refused to release his tax returns, breaking precedent that decades of major party presidential nominees have followed. The president has said he will release his tax returns when he's no longer under audit, though an audit does not prevent the president from releasing his records. The New York Times reported that Trump's tax returns show millions in losses and that Trump only paid $750 in income tax in 2016 and 2017, and in 10 of the last 15 years paid no income tax at all. It also raised questions about questionable tax deductions made by Trump that could run afoul of tax law. The president called the reporting \"fake news\" during a Sunday news conference. Biden will likely raise the revelations about the president's taxes during the debate Tuesday night. \"Donald Trump thinks that the vast majority of hardworking Americans who pay their taxes are suckers,\" Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told reporters Tuesday. \"President Trump only sees the world from Park Avenue. He looks out for the stock market but looks down on workers and middle-class families struggling to get by.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden are focused on the economy this week. The trajectory of the economy has often swayed presidential elections, but that appears to be changing.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: All right, let's pivot to politics. In normal times, the economy is a pivotal issue in a presidential election year. The presidential candidates are aware of that. And this week, both Joe Biden and Donald Trump talked about how they plan to rebuild the economy. But there are indications the economy might not be as influential in this year's election as it once was. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been reporting on this and joins us now. Good morning, Danielle. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. So before we talk about how voters internalize the economy as an issue, let's talk about the case that's being made by President Trump and Joe Biden. What are they saying? KURTZLEBEN: Sure. So both are, of course, right now amid double-digit unemployment - they're talking about rebuilding. So Biden put out a new plan yesterday that in part focused heavily on boosting manufacturing. Both candidates like to talk about buying American to boost manufacturing. In addition, Trump is on the attack against Biden, though. He's saying that Biden is bad for the middle class. He has a new ad attacking him for supporting trade deals like NAFTA. Biden, meanwhile, says that, yes, he wants to rebuild, but he also wants to fix what he sees as basic problems in the economy. So, for example, shrink big racial, economic wealth gaps and boost unionization. MARTIN: I mean, we have to acknowledge we're in a recession right now, a recession happening under the watch of President Trump. Does that not give Biden leverage on the economic argument? KURTZLEBEN: Of course it does, to some extent. But I wouldn't want to overstate that because first of all, we're not exactly sure where we'll be in November in terms of trajectory. We could be healing. We could be getting worse or just stuck. But also, the economy is Trump's best area. His approval on the economy has for a long time been quite a bit better than his overall approval rating. So a big part of his argument is, we're going to rebuild to how we were pre-pandemic because the economy was doing pretty well before all of this. But to zoom out and look at past elections, yes, we do know there is good evidence that jobless rates, personal income really has been correlated with how voters choose. And to the extent that it matters, it matters especially in swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, etc. It affects the voters on the margins there. MARTIN: On the margins. But, Danielle (laughter), I still don't understand how the economy isn't the No. 1 issue because of where we are right now. I mean, it may be caused by the pandemic. But nevertheless, the economy is not good. KURTZLEBEN: Sure. Yes. And, of course, the economy is, of course, very important to voters. But one thing that we seem to be seeing is a more intensified version of something we've seen before. And that is partisanship affecting how people see the economy. We know that it - polarization has grown in some ways, that people are very, very dug into their partisan identities - this idea of what team they're on. MARTIN: Yeah. KURTZLEBEN: And we see that in how people see the economy. During recent Democratic administrations, Republicans have seen the economy as bad and vice versa. During Republican administrations, Democrats see it as bad. That hasn't always been that way. Those yawning gaps weren't around, say, during the Bill Clinton era. So those gaps have just exploded under Donald Trump. So come November, if the economy is doing really badly, Republicans might be less likely to see it as doing worse. And if the economy were healing, Democrats might not see it that way. And therefore they wouldn't be likely to give the president credit for it. MARTIN: Oh, my. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you. We appreciate your reporting on this. KURTZLEBEN: Yes, of course. (SOUNDBITE OF GOGO PENGUIN'S \"TOTEM\") Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The mayor is considered a contender for Joe Biden's vice presidential pick.\n                \n                    \n                    Dustin Chambers/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms addresses a Democratic National Committee event in June 2019 in Atlanta. The mayor is considered a contender for Joe Biden's vice presidential pick. One of a series of reports looking at Joe Biden's potential running mates Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, one of several candidates said to be under consideration as Joe Biden's presidential running mate, has seen her profile rise fast in recent weeks as the first-term mayor has spoken out against the state of Georgia's Republican-led pandemic response and spoken forcefully to protesters in her city. Her early loyalty to the former vice president also stands out. Bottoms endorsed Biden more than a year ago. \"I think that this is not a conventional year,\" she said at a Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta in November. \"In a conventional year, you wait. And you lick your finger and you stick it up, you see which way the wind is blowing. We don't have time for that this year.\" She traveled the country stumping for Biden, arguing he is a \"statesman\" and the one to beat President Trump. Tharon Johnson, an adviser to her mayoral campaign and the Southern regional director for Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, said Bottoms was with Biden \"before it was cool to be.\" \"And she stayed committed to his campaign, even when it looked like his chance of being the nominee for the Democratic Party was bleak,\" Johnson said. \"That's got to count for something.\" Amid the pandemic, Bottoms has criticized Republican Gov. Brian Kemp's coronavirus response as he moved forward with the state's early reopening and more recently as he declined to issue a statewide mask ordinance. On Wednesday, Bottoms joined a handful of cities flouting that state decision and issued a mask mandate in Atlanta, even though Kemp's order technically supersedes local emergency action. Her handling of protests in the wake of George Floyd's death has also put her in the spotlight. At a late-night May press conference after previously peaceful Atlanta protesters had begun destroying buildings, Bottoms pleaded with them to \"go home.\" \"If you care about this city, then go home,\" she said forcefully. \"If you want change in America, go and register to vote. ... You are disgracing our city. You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.\" \"I've been there\" Bottoms, a mother of four children, said she thinks the message resonated because Atlanta has led on social justice issues going back to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 and because she speaks from personal experience. \"I've been there,\" she said. \"I have a nephew who was murdered. I know what it feels like to lose someone suddenly to senseless violence. I know what it feels like to experience racism.\" Bottoms grew up as the daughter of a famous singer, Major Lance. But he ended up serving three years in prison for selling and possessing cocaine, and her mother struggled to support the family and keep a small business afloat in Atlanta. She was a lawyer, then served as a magistrate judge and on the Atlanta City Council for two terms before winning the mayoral race in 2017. Former adviser Johnson said Bottoms' relatability, drawn from her range of life experiences, is the key to her success. \"I think she's just a Black woman who understands what it feels like to be middle class but also poor in Atlanta.\" He also pointed to the way she announced her positive coronavirus test this week. \"She could have easily been selfish and not told anyone and tried to cover it up,\" Johnson said. \"But what did she do? She came out and said, 'Look, it's hit home and I want people to know that this pandemic is real.' \" Atlanta \"is not out of control\" While her messages to protesters have landed well, some have questioned whether she remains in control of the city, particularly after another wave of unrest following the officer-involved killing of Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta. Nearly 200 police officers called out sick, though city leaders were quick to clarify the department remained able to stay properly staffed. Last weekend the city saw a spate of shootings, including the killing of 8-year-old Secoriea Turner, prompting another emotional press conference. In an interview, Bottoms asserted Atlanta \"is not out of control. And in fact, our crime numbers are even lower than they were this time last year,\" she said. \"That being said, when people are being killed, and we see the number of people who were shot and killed in our city over a weekend period, that is a problem.\" She said the city will keep two focuses, on the short-term problem of stopping the shootings and the long-term problem of the systemic issues that led to them. \"Violence is a result of a whole bunch of other stuff that comes before that moment in time before someone opens fire on our streets,\" she said. \"It's concerning; it should be concerning to all of us who call Atlanta home, and we will continue to focus on it.\" Bottoms consoles Tomika Miller, the wife of Rayshard Brooks, at the conclusion of his June 23 funeral at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.

Brooks, 27, died June 12 after an officer shot him in a Wendy's parking lot. Like Biden, Bottoms has steered clear of the \"defund the police\" push. Her administration's new budget dedicates about a third of city funding to the police; it instead reallocates corrections money to social services. Tammy Greer, who teaches political science at Clark Atlanta University and Atlanta Metropolitan State College, said the mayor's clear message for protesters has resonated well, particularly as the state and federal governments have sent mixed signals. \"That forward-facing side has been one of strength. The forward-facing side has been one of decisiveness,\" Greer said. \"And I say forward-facing because the policies do not align with the forward-facing side.\" Greer argued Bottoms' two-plus-year administration has not been able to change the status quo in a city plagued by what by one estimate is the greatest income inequality in the country, and that the administration's recent criminal justice reforms in the wake of protests have not gone far enough to make real change. The mayor signed a series of executive orders related to use of force reform and transparency, calling it part of a \"top-to-bottom review of how we police in Atlanta.\" But police are still not bound by any recommendations of the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, Greer pointed out. \"There's a thought process that she's a progressive mayor, but that doesn't add up with the policies,\" Greer said. Bottoms asserted there has been progress in the city, particularly on inequality and affordable housing. \"We're already at close to 5,000 affordable housing units in the city that have been created and/or preserved. And we are also nearly $300 million into a $1 billion [affordable housing fund] goal. And so the work continues,\" she said. \"But when people don't feel as if we're moving the needle, then obviously perception is everything. But it's happening and it's getting better. But with so many systemic issues, and challenges that we have, it just can't happen soon enough.\" Vice presidential material?

To the question of whether Bottoms thinks she's qualified to be a vice presidential candidate, or to hold another national role, she said yes: \"When you are leading a major city, you are dealing with a number of issues all at once; you're dealing with the same issues that we're seeing across this country.\" Johnson, the adviser, agrees that Bottoms fits the bill \u2014 that the problems she's dealing with at the local level are relevant nationally. \"This is a woman who is waking up every day, not only dealing with a national pandemic, but she is dealing with one of the core issues that we've got to solve,\" he said. \"And that is, how do we make sure that people understand that Black lives matter? But we also need to figure out, how do we reform our police department so they can actually get the support that they need?\" She's also proven she's a \"fighter,\" Johnson said, like Biden. \"She's definitely proven that she's not one that will shy away from problems,\" he said. \"And I think that she's a person that can develop relationships all across the country.\" Bottoms said while she knows people will keep talking about the vice presidential rumors, \"I'm continuing to focus on the job that I have before me, and that's leading our city during some very unprecedented times.\"",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden won the primaries,  but the question remains: Will he win over the progressives in his party who were backing other candidates?  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Joe Biden won the Democratic primaries. Now, his campaign is getting to work trying to win over progressives within his own party. NPR's Asma Khalid reports. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Back in January, immigrant activists from a group called United We Dream protested outside the presidential debate in Des Moines. They were singling out Joe Biden. They wanted him to promise that he would stop deportations. Cristina Jimenez leads the group, and she says they had asked all five leading presidential candidates to meet with them. CRISTINA JIMENEZ: The Biden campaign did not engage in a conversation with us even though we did request a conversation. They declined to meet with our members. KHALID: But as it became clear that Biden would be the presumptive Democratic nominee, his campaign reached out. Jimenez says they're hoping to set up a conversation soon. Activists with the youth-led climate group, the Sunrise Movement, told NPR a similar story. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) EVAN WEBER: The Biden campaign really did the least outreach of any of the major front-runners throughout the election cycle. KHALID: Evan Weber is one of the co-founders of the group and says there have now been more conversations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) WEBER: They reached out to learn what they could do to improve their proposals and record on climate crisis, I think also broader interests in engaging young people. KHALID: Despite those discussions, this week, the Sunrise Movement was one of eight progressive groups to sign an open letter to Biden. In it, they outlined an aggressive list of demands, such as adopting a wealth tax and expanding the Supreme Court. In response, the Biden campaign pointed out that they are engaging progressive leaders and continue to consider adopting additional policies. Symone Sanders is a Biden adviser. SYMONE SANDERS: And we also understand that it is critical, that it is going to take the full brunt of the Democratic umbrella, especially our progressive friends, to beat Donald Trump in November. KHALID: She's been spearheading an effort with a couple of other staffers to individually talk to progressive organizations about both their issue priorities and how to defeat Donald Trump. SANDERS: Some of those conversations are policy-first conversations, but some of those conversations are also political conversations, then we move to policy conversations later. KHALID: On the \"Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\" Bernie Sanders said there are a bunch of issues where Biden could find common ground with his supporters, like climate change, immigration and a $15 minimum wage. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LATE NIGHT WITH STEPHEN COLBERT\") BERNIE SANDERS: So, I mean, I think with Joe, he's not going to adopt my platform. I got that, all right? But if he can move in that direction, I think people say, you know what? This is a guy who we should support and will support. KHALID: Notably in that interview, one idea Sanders did not mention was \"Medicare for All.\" YVETTE SIMPSON: I do believe of all the issues, that's going to be the hardest with the Biden administration to move on, but I also think it's the one that is the most significant and would mean the most to the progressive movement. KHALID: That's Yvette Simpson. She's the CEO of Democracy for America. Her group has already put out a statement saying it's 100% committed to doing everything it can to ensure Biden defeats Trump. SIMPSON: That will be easier to do if he's got some actual issues that we can get people excited about. KHALID: The day after Sanders dropped out, Biden rolled out a plan to forgive student debt for low-income and middle-class families. And he credited the Vermont senator for laying the groundwork. It was a step, but Julian Brave Noisecat with the group Data for Progress worries that some of his fellow progressives have gotten so used to agitating that they don't recognize that progress. JULIAN BRAVE NOISECAT: I think that there's been far too little reward for the Joe Bidens of the world sort of coming into our orbit. KHALID: Right before the Nevada caucuses, Biden agreed to a moratorium on deportations. Jimenez, whom we met at the beginning of this story, said that showed Biden was willing to listen and that makes her think maybe he'll be willing to listen to them on other issues, too.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden has made overtures to Bernie Sanders and progressive groups that had backed the Vermont senator.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Joe Biden has made overtures to Bernie Sanders and progressive groups that had backed the Vermont senator. A day after Bernie Sanders dropped out of the presidential race, Joe Biden, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, made an overture to progressives. On Thursday he rolled out two new policy proposals: \"Senator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I'm proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis,\" Biden said in a statement announcing his plans. And the day before, when Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden put out a 700-word statement praising the Vermont senator as a \"powerful voice\" whose movement \"changed the dialogue in America.\" Biden and Sanders appear to have a genuine affection for one another, something that wasn't the case with Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016. And Sanders insisted from the outset of his 2020 candidacy that he would do whatever was needed to assist the eventual Democratic nominee to defeat President Trump. But the question has long been whether Sanders' most ardent progressive supporters, some of whom have been leery of Biden's record, will follow him. \"The Biden campaign really did the least outreach of any of the major front-runners to Sunrise Movement throughout the election cycle,\" said Evan Weber, one of the co-founders of the youth-led climate-focused organization. The group endorsed Sanders during the primary. But a couple of weeks ago, as it became clear that the former vice president would likely be the nominee, Weber said Biden's campaign tried to restart the relationship. \"They reached out to learn what they could do more to improve their proposals and record on [the] climate crisis,\" he said. \"And also I think [they have] a broader interest in engaging young people.\" Despite those conversations, the Sunrise Movement was one of eight youth-led progressive groups to sign an open letter to Biden that was published Wednesday. In it, they reminded Biden that even though he is now the presumptive nominee, he had struggled to win votes from young people. \"Messaging around a 'return to normalcy' does not and has not earned the support and trust of voters from our generation,\" the organizations wrote. \"For so many young people, going back to the way things were 'before Trump' isn't a motivating enough reason to cast a ballot in November.\" Collectively, the groups asked for concessions on both policy and personnel, and they outlined a list of aggressive demands, such as adopting a wealth tax, supporting \"Medicare for All,\" eliminating the filibuster and expanding the Supreme Court. In response, Biden's policy director, Stef Feldman, said in a statement: \"Vice President Biden and our campaign have been engaging with progressive leaders. We are continuously considering additional policies that build on his existing policies and further the bold goals driving Vice President Biden's campaign.\" Behind the scenes, Feldman and Biden advisers Cristobal Alex and Symone Sanders have been reaching out to progressive organizations individually to talk. \"Some of those conversations are policy-first conversations,\" Sanders said. \"But some of those conversations are also political conversations. Then we move to policy. ... We come to the conversation saying, 'Where do we agree?' And after we're aligned on where we agree, how can we expand upon that agreement?\" Sanders says that agreement might result in specific policy plans, but it also might mean discussing ways they can collectively take on Trump in November. Still, despite the goodwill gestures the Biden campaign is offering, some progressives are frustrated. Some organizations said the Biden campaign hasn't tried to reach out to them. \"We have obviously not touched base with everyone we need to talk to,\" Sanders acknowledged on Thursday. But multiple groups, including a few that have now been in touch with Biden's team, spoke of trying to engage with his campaign during the primary only to be ignored. As much as these activists want their policy ideas accepted, it seems at least some of them simply want to be heard. Bernie Sanders told Stephen Colbert on The Late Show on Wednesday that he knows Biden is \"not gonna adopt\" his platform, but if the former vice president can indicate that he's willing to listen, Sanders thinks his supporters will come around. In that same interview, Sanders also suggested Biden can and will move on a range of policy issues that matter to Sanders' voters, such as tuition-free college, climate change, raising the minimum wage, criminal justice reform and immigration reform. Notably, Sanders did not mention his signature issue: Medicare for All. But for some of his supporters, health care is the most important issue, especially at this moment. \"I believe it's important to see movement on Medicare for All,\" said Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy Action, an umbrella group of a number of progressive organizations that had endorsed Sanders during the primary. \"It is kind of unimaginable that someone who is running as the Democratic nominee could still defend the idea of private health insurance in a moment like this,\" she added, referring to record levels of unemployment during the coronavirus crisis. Her organization has not spoken directly with the Biden campaign, but she said his team has reached out to some groups in their network, specifically Latino groups. Of all issues, health care is likely the most difficult for Biden to move on, but Yvette Simpson, CEO of Democracy for America, feels it would be the most meaningful. Her organization also backed Sanders in the primary. Simpson worries that if Biden can't show any additional policy changes on health care, it'll be challenging to motivate progressive voters to support him. Two other important issues, she said, are climate change and income inequality.  And on those, she thinks there could be some room for change. \"Despite the fact that I'm very, very hard on Biden, I think we have seen him shift over the decade, so I'm cautiously optimistic about his potential to shift,\" Simpson said. \"We know him to be someone who is willing to listen, we've seen this shift on the [1990s] crime bill and his acknowledgement of his failures there.\" DFA issued a statement Wednesday saying that is a \"100% committed to doing everything\" it can to ensure Biden defeats Trump. That means it'll be using its organizing muscle \u2014 money and people \u2014 to turn out voters for Biden in November. \"That'll be easier to do if he has some actual issues we can get people excited about,\" Simpson added with a laugh.",

Last summer, when Elizabeth Warren was bringing out thousands of people at mega-rallies who would wait long into the night in seemingly never-ending \"selfie\" lines, progressive groups were torn. They saw both Warren and her fellow presidential candidate Bernie Sanders as allies for their causes. Sanders had inherited goodwill from his 2016 run against Hillary Clinton. But Warren was the charismatic star on late night TV who had fought the big banks during the recession and, notably, was the politician progressives had initially tried to draft into the 2016 primary as an opponent to Clinton before Sanders entered the race. \"Our members really wanted to see her run in that race,\" explained Charles Chamberlain, chair of Democracy for America, one of the organizations that had helped spearhead the \"Run, Warren, Run\" movement in 2015. \"We believed that she would have been a better candidate than Hillary Clinton.\" Last week, Democracy for America endorsed Sanders over Warren. Chamberlain said the major change in the interim years was Sanders' presidential bid in 2016. \"Bernie Sanders ran \u2014 in 2016 \u2014 an incredible campaign that won 23 contests, changed the narrative in this country about what is possible for progressives, and even moved the entire Democratic Party to the left,\" he said. For much of the primary season, Chamberlain said, the group's members were split, but as it became clear that Sanders was winning races and Warren couldn't finish higher than third place, they decided to publicly back the Vermont senator. \"The guiding principle among our members was, who is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump and who can win?\" Chamberlain said. The story of how and why the woman who was once lauded as the great progressive political hope lost the backing of a number of leading progressive groups explains part of why Warren's campaign failed. If Sanders had not run this year, they agree, they would have wholeheartedly backed Warren. Some groups made a point of insisting their endorsements were not because of anything Warren said or did, but because of Sanders' credibility and consistency on issues like health care and climate change. They bristle at the suggestion of a single moment that led to their decisions, but they acknowledge a turning point that began in October when freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Sanders. The Vermont senator's support then accelerated into the winter as Warren was seen as backpedaling on a core issue \u2014 Medicare for All. A message: Don't stay neutral The first major progressive group to make an endorsement was the Working Families Party in September, and it chose Warren. \"Elizabeth Warren has been a personal hero to many WFP members,\" the group's national director, Maurice Mitchell, said to an estimated 20,000-person crowd at a rally in New York City. \"Her critique of the financial industry helped lay the groundwork for Occupy Wall Street.\" The Working Families Party's decision sent a message to fellow progressives: Don't stay neutral in the primary; pick a side. At the time, Warren was rising in the polls, and for a sliver of time, she even overtook Joe Biden as the national front-runner. So, it seemed that both progressive organizations and voters would be split between Warren and Sanders. But, ultimately, that's not what happened. \"You started to see dominoes fall\" In October, three of the four members of the so-called congressional \"squad\" of progressives \u2014 Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar \u2014 decided to back Sanders in quick succession. This young, multiracial group of women, some of the most outspoken progressive voices in Congress, had put their foot on the scale. And progressives across the country noticed. Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, described the endorsements as \"very impactful.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders stand together during a February campaign event at the Whittemore Center Arena in Durham, N.H.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders stand together during a February campaign event at the Whittemore Center Arena in Durham, N.H. \"You started to see dominoes fall after that,\" said George Goehl, the director of People's Action, a coalition of progressive groups that says it represents an estimated 1 million people. The organization endorsed Sanders in December. Also in December, the Center for Popular Democracy Action, another progressive coalition, backed Sanders. And then in January, the Sunrise Movement, a group of thousands of young climate activists, publicly backed Sanders. They all pointed to the Vermont senator's authenticity plus the unparalleled time and access he gave them. But some of them also acknowledged a concern many Democrats have alluded to this cycle \u2014 electability. \"A lot of us believe Sen. Sanders is uniquely capable of winning and beating Trump,\" said Goehl. The battle to out-progressive Sanders Warren fans often praised her trademark plans and her focus on policy. But when it came to ideology, Sanders took those ideas further. Warren promised a 2-cent wealth tax on people with a net worth over $50 million. Sanders upped her, and called for a 1% wealth tax on net worth above $32 million. Warren promised affordable child care. Then Sanders promised free child care. \"All the candidates [had] progressive stances, but Bernie's tend to go furthest,\" said Evan Weber, political director and co-founder of the Sunrise Movement. And that was a distinction many progressives noticed. October was a tough month for Warren. She was repeatedly questioned by journalists and her opponents over the details of how she would pay for Medicare for All without raising middle-class taxes. On Nov. 1, she put out a plan, but the more details she offered, the more compromising she appeared to progressive purists. \"Her sort of distancing herself from Medicare for All and when she thought she would be able to get it done \u2014 really, you know, distanced her from our folks,\" said Natalia Salgado, political director with the Center for Popular Democracy Action. One progressive activist whom NPR spoke with for this story is backing Sanders but acknowledged that Warren's two-step plan on Medicare for All was the more realistic way to achieve universal coverage. Still, he said, she shouldn't have compromised at the outset, because Republicans would chip away at it further. Democrats, he insisted, needed to be bold and uncompromising. There was another key issue for progressives \u2014 immigration. It has increasingly become a pillar of the their agenda, especially under President Trump's administration. \"The sort of defining factors for us between Bernie and Warren was his stance on a moratorium for deportations,\" Salgado said. (In November, Sanders released an immigration plan calling for a moratorium. Around the same time, Warren said she was \"open\" to a moratorium. In February, Sanders' campaign manager suggested the candidate's moratorium would have some exceptions, but by then, Sanders was already benefiting from being seen as the furthest left on this issue.) The struggle for Warren was that she could never seem to out-progressive the man who had come to define the movement after 2016.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren suspended her presidential campaign today, leaving essentially a two-man battle for the Democratic nomination between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren held a call with her campaign staff today, told them she loved them and announced that it was over. The now-former presidential candidate then went outside her home in Cambridge, Mass., and spoke to reporters. She spoke about the reality that the only candidates with pass to the Democratic nomination now are men. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: One of the hardest parts of this is all those pinky promises and all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years. CORNISH: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us now. Welcome back. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi. CORNISH: We can hear in her voice what a tough decision this was for the senator. At one point, she was at the front of this Democratic field. Why didn't it work out for her? LIASSON: Well, that is one of the big mysteries of this race. She was the front-runner, as you said. She was considered to be the candidate with the best political skills on the stump. She was able to translate her plans into commonsense, ordinary, down-to-earth language for - that ordinary people who are struggling economically could understand. Today, she took a stab at answering that question - why didn't it work out? Here's what she said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WARREN: I was told at the beginning of this whole undertaking that there are two lanes - a progressive lane that Bernie Sanders is the incumbent for and a moderate lane that Joe Biden is the incumbent for - and there's no room for anyone else in this. I thought that wasn't right, but evidently I was wrong. LIASSON: That's what she says now. But her original theory of the case was that she had to cleave to Bernie Sanders. She didn't forge a moderate path when it came to health care. She felt she had to make Sanders' health care plan for mandatory Medicare for All add up on paper without raising middle-class taxes. And that was kind of a trap for her because when she came out with her plan and people realized it meant no more private health insurance, people who wanted a purely progressive candidate stuck with the OG, Bernie Sanders, and other white, college-educated liberals kind of abandoned her for Pete Buttigieg. So it was hard for her to forge that middle path. CORNISH: In the meantime, her reference to little girls having to wait four more years invites the question about what role gender played in this race. Is there any way to answer that? LIASSON: Gender definitely played a role. How much of a role it played is hard to tease out from all the other problems. But today, she did talk about it. She said, gender is the trap question for every woman. If you say, yes, there was sexism, everyone calls you a whiner; if you say, no, there was no sexism, a billion women will say, what planet are you living on? She said that she has a lot more to say about this in the future. But that being said, we should point out that there is still a woman in this race, Tulsi Gabbard - she has two delegates - and that a woman won the popular vote in 2016. CORNISH: The big political question today was, would she actually do a formal endorsement - right? - of Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders? She's not ready to endorse yet, she says. So what kind of calculation is that for her? LIASSON: Well, on the one hand, she's under pressure to endorse Bernie Sanders, for whom her policy agenda and his have a lot of overlaps. But Elizabeth Warren is also a player. Don't forget - she is the only politician in modern history, recent history, who came up with an idea for a major government agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and made it happen. She stood that up. So she wants to have results. Maybe she'd want to go into the administration if a Democratic wins - Democrat wins the White House. I think she is a thought leader in the party. If the Democrats get the White House and the Senate back, I think they will pass many of Elizabeth Warren's many plans, and maybe that means that she wants to go with the current front-runner, Joe Biden. We'll have to wait and see. CORNISH: I want to talk about the people who are left in the race. Bernie Sanders is headed to Michigan, and that's interesting because he canceled a rally in Mississippi. This is another Southern state that's got a large black Democratic electorate. People see that as favoring Joe Biden. Is Bernie abandoning the South? What's going on? LIASSON: Well, that is pretty significant. This is definitely become the whiplash election. A couple weeks ago, Bernie looked like he might be developing an unstoppable lead for the nomination or at least a plurality of delegates; now he's going back to try to save his campaign in Michigan, which was a state where he won in 2016. So it shows you how much this race has changed so quickly. CORNISH: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Thanks for your analysis. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "A senior campaign aide to Elizabeth Warren tells NPR Thursday that the Massachusetts senator is dropping out of the presidential race, two days after a disappointing finish in Super Tuesday primaries.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Elizabeth Warren is out. The Massachusetts senator is leaving the presidential race after a disappointing finish on Super Tuesday. A senior campaign aide has confirmed to NPR News that she will suspend her campaign today. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been covering the Warren campaign and is in our studios. Good morning. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hello. INSKEEP: Did Warren have any choice after not winning many delegates on Tuesday? KURTZLEBEN: I mean, not really, no. It was practically impossible at this point, really, for her to win. What already seemed like a narrow path going into Super Tuesday... INSKEEP: Yeah. KURTZLEBEN: ...Seemed like a virtually nonexistent path by the end of it. I mean, she may have had money left over. She pulled in quite a bit of money after really slamming Michael Bloomberg during that debate. But if you can't win the delegates, then, you know, you might imagine her thinking, well, what's the point? INSKEEP: I want to figure out what happened here because Warren is very well known, has been popular among Democrats for a long time, had a very organized campaign... KURTZLEBEN: Sure. INSKEEP: ...Raised a lot of money, was the front-runner in polls at some point last year. What went wrong? KURTZLEBEN: I mean, we're going to be doing those sort of postmortems for a while, I'm sure. There are any number of things. I mean, there was some dissatisfaction back in the fall, right around the time that her polls dropped with her responses to questions about Medicare for All. INSKEEP: Oh, yeah. KURTZLEBEN: Example - the woman with a plan for everything didn't have a plan at first for how to pay for Medicare for All or then a plan that seemed to satisfy debate moderators, some voters, as far as how to pay for that, you know, taxing or not taxing the middle class. But aside from that, listen - there are voters who did - who were very worried about Donald Trump, about electability. There are definitely voters on that trail who said, I like Elizabeth Warren. I don't know if she can beat him. I'll vote for someone else. So that was definitely another part of it. INSKEEP: I've been fascinated to interview voters, including women... KURTZLEBEN: Yes. INSKEEP: ...Who have said, I don't think a woman can win. I - we got to win this election, got to vote for a man. And this is - I'm quoting women who have said this. It's remarkable. KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. I mean, I got to say, I've spoken to a lot of voters - this is anecdotal but based on a lot of interviews. I heard that way more - I heard that more often from women than men, by the way. So there's a lot to unpack there. INSKEEP: Yeah. Yeah. And who knows? And maybe men thought that way as well... KURTZLEBEN: Sure. Absolutely. INSKEEP: ...And weren't so comfortable saying it. But in any case, people were saying that, and that may well have been a factor, anecdotally, in what happened to Elizabeth Warren here. Now, let's talk about the decision that you have learned that she is making today. KURTZLEBEN: Sure. INSKEEP: Pete Buttigieg pulled out. Amy Klobuchar pulled out a few days ago. And both of those were seen as strategic moves to bolster a mainstream candidate - Joe Biden. KURTZLEBEN: Sure. INSKEEP: Warren is more on the Bernie Sanders side of things. Is she doing this to help Bernie Sanders? KURTZLEBEN: That's (laughter) - I don't have inside information on that. I have - I really don't know. But listen - when you look at polls in terms of who people's second choices are, there's a poll from Morning Consult, a few days old at this point, which might as well be a lifetime ago. INSKEEP: Another planet. KURTZLEBEN: But at the very least, it is not as if all of Elizabeth Warren's supporters are going - appear like they're going to jump ship to Bernie Sanders. Around 40% of her supporters at the time said he was their second choice, which leaves 60%. They may go to him; they may go to Joe Biden. It's not entirely clear. INSKEEP: Oh, so we do not know exactly why Warren dropped out now, other than the brutal reality of the numbers. KURTZLEBEN: Right. INSKEEP: And we don't know who this helps yet. KURTZLEBEN: No, absolutely not. It's easy - I mean, listen - policywise she's closer to Bernie Sanders, but we don't know exactly voterwise - since voters don't necessarily vote on ideology or policy, we don't know exactly who is going to come out better for this. INSKEEP: Nor do we know who she would choose to endorse, if anyone. KURTZLEBEN: No, we do not. She has a history of friction with Joe Biden, especially over bankruptcy. But I mean, she had been slamming the two of them in recent speeches on the trail as well. INSKEEP: Danielle, thanks for your reporting. Really appreciate it. KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben on this morning when we have learned that Elizabeth Warren is about to suspend her presidential campaign. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden has seen a surge of momentum following endorsements from some former rival candidates. That's left the Biden presidential campaign with new expectations for Super Tuesday.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It's Super Tuesday, and no state offers Democrats a bigger delegate prize than California. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid is in California in Los Angeles. She's been traveling with the campaign of Joe Biden and joins us now. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: A lot's happened with the Biden campaign in the last four days - that big win in South Carolina, now endorsements from former rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. What's the mood among his campaign staff you're talking to? KHALID: Well, it's really such a change. I mean, parts of Iowa and New Hampshire felt pretty somber. The events just didn't have the type of energy that I've begun to see in the last few days. It has really changed dramatically so quickly. By the way, Ari, I should mention I'm on a bus. SHAPIRO: Yeah, I can hear that rumbling in the background. KHALID: That's the background noise you probably hear (laughter). I was in Dallas last night, where Biden got the endorsement of Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke. And, you know, when you listen to the former vice president, he kind of seems to speak with a renewed vigor. Here's a snippet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: The Democrats want to name a nominee who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it, take on the NRA and the gun manufacturers, protect our children, will stand up for the middle class, not raise their taxes and make promises that can't be kept. Then join us. KHALID: And, you know, within that answer, Ari, I think there were obviously - there was, obviously, a subtext of Bernie Sanders. You know, he is somebody who wants to replace Obamacare with \"Medicare for All\" and has these bold promises that Joe Biden is sort of skeptical of; whether or not he can actually - whether or not any politician could actually implement them. I think what's most notable in terms of the new energy around Biden is that we have very quickly seen the establishment - we have seen other moderate candidates in this field coalesce around Joe Biden as the single alternative to Bernie Sanders ahead of Super Tuesday. And that has happened with remarkable speed. SHAPIRO: And what are you hearing from voters that you're talking to? KHALID: Well, the rallies are certainly busy. And when I talk to voters - I will say earlier on in Iowa and New Hampshire, I heard a lot about electability. I continue to hear about electability, but it seems like people are more convinced in their choices for other reasons. Yesterday, at a rally in Houston, I met Pablo Fernandez. He's a Biden supporter who told me he likes the former vice president's message of unity. He feels like a lot of politics these days is polarizing, and he wants somebody who's going to be a unifier. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PABLO FERNANDEZ: People call the tea partiers the deplorables, but I really feel that both sides, both extremes are equally deplorable because they're hate-filled. We don't need hate. We need unison. KHALID: And so, again, Ari, that's kind of an implicit rebuke there of the Sanders wing of the party and some of Bernie Sanders' online supporters, whom, you know, many folks within the Democratic Party feel have really been causing, you know, divisiveness within the party itself. SHAPIRO: This surge of support for Biden has really just come in the last few days, and the Sanders campaign has been well-resourced and energized for a while. Some key states voting today, including California, appear strong for Sanders. So what are Biden's expectations tonight? KHALID: Yeah, you know, you mentioned California, and I should say that Bernie Sanders seems to have led both in Nevada, as well as some of the polling we've seen even yesterday that looks at Latino voters. And a sizable chunk of the electorate in both California and Texas are Latino voters. Biden hopes for some wins in Southern states, states that specifically have a large, sizable population of black voters. We saw in South Carolina, he seems to have a strength there. His intent is, obviously, to collect delegates in as many states as he can, and he will need to reach a 15% threshold in order to collect any delegates. Prior to some of these other candidates getting out of the race, there were some questions about whether he could reach that delegate threshold in a state like California. Things are certainly looking much better for him in terms of reaching that 15% viability in a lot more places. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Asma Khalid in Los Angeles, where she's been traveling with the Biden campaign. And we're going to be hearing from reporters traveling with the other campaigns in other parts of the show. Thank you, Asma. KHALID: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The outbreak of the new coronavirus has sent Iranians scrambling to avoid becoming another statistic in a country with more deaths from the disease than any besides China. Iran has reported 77 deaths from COVID-19, and 2,336 confirmed cases of infection, as of Tuesday.

Iranians take pride in their ability to ride out tough times. But during a recent NPR visit to Tehran, public concern over the government's response to the virus was apparent. The coronavirus outbreak comes at a time when Iran is already reeling from economic woes as the United States imposes tough economic sanctions on the country. Iran's economy contracted by an estimated 9.5% last year.

He blamed the U.S. sanctions for endangering Iranian patients. Unable to predict Trump or coronavirus Iran enjoyed an economic growth spurt after Tehran and other world powers signed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, when many sanctions were lifted in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program. That recovery began to sour after President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018.

Salehi-Isfahani estimates the country's middle class has shrunk by about 10% since the sanctions hit. In Tehran, it doesn't take long to find residents struggling to make ends meet. \"We've had a problem, no other companies are selling products to us, so we don't have too much to sell,\" says 35-year-old Mohsen at his housewares shop near Tehran's Shoosh Square. Like most people interviewed for this story, he gave only his first name, worried about potential retribution for speaking with an American reporter.

Crews of cleaners were dispatched to disinfect trains, buses and public gathering places.\n                \n                    \n                    Marjan Yazdi for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption People sit in the main waiting area in Tehran's railway station.

When asked if the newly elected Iranian parliament, with its majority of hard-liners, might do something to help, he shakes his head: \"No, actually, they will possibly make it worse,\" he says. \"Resistance economy\" The 2018 collapse of Iran's currency, skyrocketing prices and rising unemployment all contributed to the country's economic woes.

There was a sharp drop in imports as well, but that actually had an interesting side effect: Unable to rely on goods from abroad, demand for locally produced items began to rise. Production in Iran of things like home appliances and housewares has begun to rise, according to economists. Mehdi Naseri gets up from behind the counter at his jewelry shop to emphasize that point. \"It's getting better,\" he says, \"because there's no import of Chinese products so we can sell Iranian products.\" A typically busy highway in Tehran has only a few cars on the road.\n                \n                    \n                    Marjan Yazdi for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A typically busy highway in Tehran has only a few cars on the road. Naseri says that it will take a while for the economy to really pick up, but increased self-reliance is \"good for our factories and the workers, and it will continue to improve.\" Naseri's comments are squarely in line with the views of Iran's supreme leader. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei regularly exhorts Iranians to rely on their \"resistance economy\" to endure whatever hardships are visited on Iran by enemies such as the U.S. Now another enemy has come to test their resistance \u2014 the coronavirus. Authorities' delayed response Outside another crowded Tehran pharmacy, a 52-year-old Iranian American named Giti says she has family in the U.S. She is one of many in Tehran who suspect the government deliberately delayed announcing the coronavirus crisis for political reasons. Iran reported its first confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Feb. 19. Giti says she thinks the government withheld a broader response until after the parliamentary election on Feb. 21, because officials may have worried people wouldn't turn out to vote if there were fears of catching the virus. \"I think it was worse, they just didn't mention it,\" she says. With the number of cases and fatalities still on the rise, Iranians are finding it hard to see things improving anytime soon. In Iran's Grand Bazaar, 72-year-old Masoumeh adjusts the medical mask on her face and looks around at the sparse crowd. The retired teacher says few customers are showing up at other markets too, even though normally this would be a busy time: the run-up to the Persian new year, Nowruz, on March 20. \"It's more empty now,\" says Masoumeh. \"Our New Year's is coming, but even officials are having problems. Of course it will be harder for our families,\" she says, adding, \"maybe next year will be even worse.\"",

            "article_content": "Israeli voters go to the polls Monday for an unprecedented third time in a year and may face yet another deadlocked election.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: On Monday, Israel will hold its third round of elections in less than a year. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not able to muster a parliamentary majority after two earlier votes, and neither could his competitors. This time, voter fatigue could determine the results. NPR's Daniel Estrin has this report from Jerusalem. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: How do you convince voters to show up to the polls for a repeat election when the last two were inconclusive? Israel's elections committee is using guilt. Its TV ads have teens stare at the camera. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Through interpreter) Mom, if you don't vote, you're putting my future into someone else's hands. Why? ESTRIN: The commercials may not be enough. MATAN ELIMELECH: I have a daughter, and every time I see that commercial, I have a raging - it's upset me because I truly concern for my daughter's future. But no, I don't believe in any of you. And I'm not voting for any of you. ESTRIN: Matan Elimelech sips an espresso in Jerusalem. He did vote in the last two elections for right wing parties that support Benjamin Netanyahu. But he's sick of the barrage of election ads and sees no one worth voting for. ELIMELECH: Netanyahu did what he can do. He did the best he can do. He finished I think. ESTRIN: Netanyahu has been in office for over a decade. He called elections seeking yet another term. But in part because of his corruption charges that have reduced his popularity, the results were inconclusive, so he kept trying again and again. Natalie Simantov, who I met walking her dog, says she'll still vote for Netanyahu, but... NATALIE SIMANTOV: It's an ego trip. You know, he's never going to go away apparently. He doesn't want to go away. ESTRIN: Netanyahu has been holding daily rallies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Speaking Hebrew). ESTRIN: He's imploring supporters to drag their friends to vote. He has reason to worry. Polls suggest his right-wing supporters are less likely to go vote than those supporting his rival, the centrist former Army General Benny Gantz. Hebrew University politics professor Gayil Talshir. GAYIL TALSHIR: The upper middle classes believe much more in the representative democracy. And they are enthusiastic about changing the government and throwing Netanyahu. And this is why they might vote in a higher proportion than the right. ESTRIN: There is one big new issue in these elections. Netanyahu promises he'll annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. That move would raise objections from most countries and Palestinians but has a thumbs up from President Trump. The centrist candidate Gantz says he would not annex settlements without international support. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot vote Monday. Activist Anas Abu Srour wouldn't want to vote anyway. ANAS ABU SROUR: I think there's no difference between all Israeli leaders. All of them, like, especially like Netanyahu, Gantz, they are coming from a military background. And all of them, they, like, do the crimes against Palestinian people and they like kill innocent people. I think the one who control Israel nowadays is the settlers. ESTRIN: In polls of Israeli voters, the prospect of West Bank annexation hasn't seemed to shift the political map. Israeli journalist Danny Zaken. DANNY ZAKEN: America changes dramatically its views about the settlements and basically give the permission to annex them, which is huge. Nonetheless, it's almost a non-issue in this elections. I mean, it's unbelievable. And that shows that the elections are not ideological, show the elections are personal, totally personal, Netanyahu or those against Netanyahu. ESTRIN: Netanyahu and Gantz are telling their supporters they need to come out and help them win or face a dreaded fourth election. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Jerusalem. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

            "article_content": "Democratic candidates debate in Charleston, S.C., tonight, ahead of the state's Saturday primary. With Bernie Sanders now a clear front-runner, others are stepping up attacks on the Vermont senator.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: With his win in Nevada, Senator Bernie Sanders has become the candidate to beat in the Democratic presidential contest, so he's likely to get some tough questions in tonight's debate. He will be one of seven candidates onstage in South Carolina, which holds its primary on Saturday. Joining me now from the Palmetto State are NPR political correspondents Juana Summers and Asma Khalid. Hey there, you two. JUANA SUMMERS, BYLINE: Hi there. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi. KELLY: Hi. OK, Juana, you first. I want to just get the landscape, the state of the race there in South Carolina. How are the candidates making their case to voters? SUMMERS: Sure, so a lot has changed in the weeks since we've last been here. Bernie Sanders is now the frontrunner in this race, having picked up wins in a number of contests. And a lot of the attention is turning to him. He is someone who, in 2016, didn't perform as well here. But this year, he's rising in the polls and gaining ground with black voters, who make up roughly 60% of the state's Democratic electorate. Now, Joe Biden has been promising a win here for some time. And I was just at an event with some of his top surrogates. One lawmaker who's backing him, Congressman G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, says he believes Biden will win the state by double digits on Saturday, so some real confidence. Now, Biden's campaign has been focusing on Sanders. He's released this new digital ad in South Carolina accusing Bernie Sanders of trying to undermine President Obama's 2012 reelection campaign by threatening a primary challenge to him. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Back in Washington, there was one guy with another plan. BERNIE SANDERS: I think it would be a good idea if President Obama faced some primary opposition. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Bernie Sanders was seriously thinking about challenging our first African American president in a primary. SUMMERS: Now, it's important to note that Sanders has said this is not true. But in this state, it's a really charged message with such a heavily black Democratic electorate here. And that's a group that's on top of mind for a lot of candidates in this state. KELLY: Yeah. And, Asma, I want to bring you in on this. Where are y'all, by the way? I can hear a lot of noise behind you. KHALID: Yeah, we're actually at the filing center, so we're here on the campus of where this debate's going to occur. KELLY: Got it, OK. KHALID: And so people are kind of setting up their own TV live hits (ph) behind us. KELLY: Everybody getting ready for all the action tonight - OK, so back to the black electorate that we just heard Juana talking about there, this has been Joe Biden's thing. It has been that he feels he has support among black voters. He has talked about South Carolina in particular and how he thinks he will win that slice of the electorate. He's talked about it as a firewall for his whole candidacy. How much is at stake for him tonight in this debate? KHALID: I think so much is at stake for him and more him, perhaps, than any other candidate. I mean, as you mentioned, he has long been insisting that he would do better once this race moved on to more diverse states. That's initially what they were saying. Then we saw how poorly he finished in Nevada, and now the argument is he will do better once this race moves on to a state with a sizable African American population. If he does not have a decisive win in South Carolina, I just think his arguments around electability become really hard to sell moving forward. And look. I mean, I think this is worth pointing out that this is not just a contest ahead of the South Carolina primary. This is going to be the last debate before Super Tuesday. KELLY: Yeah. KHALID: And so, you know, at that point, he's really trying to sort of squoosh (ph) some of Sanders' momentum. And, you know, as Juana said, he has been criticizing Bernie Sanders more so in recent days and not just for this possible, you know, alleged primary challenge to Barack Obama during his second term but also for the fact that he thinks the Vermont senator has a really ambitious list of public policies - that he is not being truthful about how he will pay for these without raising taxes on the middle class. KELLY: And we should note Joe Biden - far from the only candidate who has his sights set on Bernie Sanders tonight, right, Juana? SUMMERS: Yeah, that's right. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg spoke here last night. He, essentially, is making the case that Bernie Sanders being the nominee would hurt Democrats down the ballot, that he isn't espousing an inclusive politics while the two of them may share some of the same ideals. We've also been hearing a lot from former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. If you've looked online, he's been tweeting all day about his fight for gun safety legislation and how he's taken on the National Rifle Association, while saying that Sanders' record on gun is not strong. Mike Bloomberg has been hunkered down in debate prep, off the campaign trail for days, so we'll be waiting to see if he launches a new attack on Bernie Sanders the way they've been telegraphing. KELLY: Right, because Bloomberg's first debate performance was, I think, fair to say, pretty rocky. Senator Elizabeth Warren really went after him. Asma, are we expecting the same thing from her tonight? KHALID: I think that we'll all be watching really interesting - you know, curiosity - what she's doing. She had been going for the unity angle for a while prior to that last debate. But she unleashed, as you mentioned, on several other candidates, especially Bloomberg. And, you know, in recent days, it appears that she's been keeping up that fighting spirit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: Do you crouch, or do you fight back? Me - I'm fighting back. (CHEERING) WARREN: Fighting back is an act of patriotism. (CHEERING) KHALID: But Mary Louise, I think what's more interesting to me - even though, maybe, Mike Bloomberg is this perfect foil for her message on income inequality - is, does she finally direct her fire at Bernie Sanders? They certainly have some overlapping support amongst progressive voters. But, you know, he is the front-runner. And in the last debate, it did not seem like his rival saw him that way. KELLY: We will watch and see. That is NPR's Asma Khalid and Juana Summers reporting there from South Carolina. Thanks, you two. KHALID: You're welcome. SUMMERS: Thanks. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

President Trump promised this week to send cards worth $200 to seniors to help them pay for their prescription drugs, but it's unclear how he will be able to pull it off \u2014 or how legal it is. If he can, that's $6.6 billion to a key voting bloc weeks before Election Day. \"Under my plan, 33 million Medicare beneficiaries will soon receive a card in the mail containing $200 that they can use to help pay for prescription drugs,\" Trump told a crowd in Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday. \"Nobody has seen this before. These cards are incredible. The cards will be mailed out in coming weeks.\" Although anything involving the Treasury usually needs congressional approval, the White House doesn't plan to go that route. Instead, officials say the White House plans to use a section of the Social Security Act that allows Medicare to test out new programs aimed at saving money, for example, to see whether they work. Called \"demonstrations,\" these are usually proposed by state governments, agency staff, Congress or the private sector. And the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is tasked with evaluating and approving them. But not all Medicare demonstrations are approved, says Robin Feldman, a professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, who focuses on the pharmaceutical industry and drug policy. \"In my mind, the question is whether the White House could bypass the considerably extensive procedures established by the agency to evaluate proposals,\" she says. \"That's a process that can take some time. And the White House seems to have a few weeks in mind so that it happens before the election.\" Because so few details of the proposal have been released, Feldman says it's not clear how the administration plans to do this. What's more, it's unclear what, if anything, the Trump administration is studying by sending out $200 prescription cards. \"What is really being tested here?\" says Ameet Sarpatwari, assistant director of Harvard Medical School's Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law. \"Is this a proper use of the demonstration authority?... I think the administration is pushing the envelope in terms of classifying this as a demonstration.\" Under this section of the Social Security Act, demonstrations also need to be \"cost neutral.\" White House officials say they can pay for it with savings from the president's recent \"most favored nation\" executive order, which would tie certain Medicare drug prices to the prices for those drugs in other countries. But again, this detail is fuzzy because it's unclear how much money the executive order would save \u2014 if it's implemented at all. There are still more procedural steps that it, too, must go through before it can become a reality. \"We're sort of, again, putting the cart before the horse here and saying we assume that this 'most favored nation' approach will actually happen and that if it happens, what will the savings actually be?\" Sarpatwari says. \"So there's quite a bit of inferential leaps to say we will have money to pay for this cash giveaway.\" Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services say many of the details are still being worked out, and they will send the cards out \"as soon as mechanically possible,\" but they won't all go out before the election. Either way, health policy researchers, advocacy groups, members of Congress and even the pharmaceutical industry say the prescription cards fall short of any lasting way to curb high drug prices. \"As with all one time gifts, once the patient pockets the money, the benefits, they still have to pay high drug prices,\" Feldman says. \"In my view, that $6.6 billion would be better spent addressing underlying problems in the pharmaceutical industry.\"",

Ossoff is in a runoff with Republican David Perdue, the incumbent, for the U.S. Senate. There was still an hour to go before Vice President Pence took the stage to stump for Georgia's two incumbent U.S. senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Both Republicans are fighting to hold onto their seats against Democratic challengers, with a runoff election set for Jan. 5. But Pence was clearly the celebrity draw at this Nov. 20 campaign event in Canton, an Atlanta suburb. People were so eager to see him that parking spots were scarce and a long line of cars snaked through the parking lot of a community college. Some drivers jumped the curb and parked in the grass. Hundreds of people, many unmasked, had to undergo temperature checks before boarding large coach buses for a short ride down the road to the rally site. It took place in a large open space outside of a conference center, but people stood close together, with little physical distancing. Next month's runoff in Georgia was triggered after no candidate in either Senate race won more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 general election. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and with the fate of the Affordable Care Act in question, Republicans are hoping the two incumbents can hang on to their seats, and thus preserve their party's control of the Senate, by a 50-48 margin. But if the two Democratic challengers, the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, both win their runoffs, it will allow Democrats to take narrow control of the Senate, with the help of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as a tiebreaker. Yana De Moraes had come to the rally from another Atlanta suburb, Buford. She's uninsured, and, after a recent hospital stay, had been thinking a lot about how expensive medical care can be. \"We would like our health care costs lowered, so it could be more affordable,\" she said, with a rueful laugh. \"So you don't get another heart attack while you're getting a bill!\" De Moraes added she'd also like to see better price controls on prescription drugs to stop pharmaceutical companies from \"robbing American people.\" Vice President Pence waves to supporters during a Nov. 20 rally in Canton, Ga.

Pence appeared alongside U.S. Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. The Republican incumbents are defending their seats in a Jan. 5 runoff. Other voters said they were just looking for any kind of change, ideally one that involves less government involvement in health care. Barry Brown had made the 40-mile drive from his home in Atlanta for the rally. He's retired but too young to qualify for Medicare, so he has Obamacare insurance, which he affords with the help of a federal subsidy. \"It sort of works. It's better than nothing,\" Brown said. \"I would like to see an improved health care situation. I don't know what that will be, so maybe they'll mention that today. I'm hoping so.\" But Brown didn't get the answers he was looking for. At the rally, Loeffler made only brief mention of her health care plan, which focuses on reducing drug prices and giving people access to insurance options that cost less but offer fewer benefits. When it was his turn to speak, Perdue didn't talk much about health care either, though he did take a shot at Obamacare, which he's voted multiple times to overturn. \"Remember a little thing called the Affordable Care Act? You think that was done bipartisan?\" Perdue asked the crowd. \"No! It was done with a supermajority! Can you imagine what they're gonna do if they get control of the Senate?\" This has been typical for how the two Republicans handled health care as they campaigned throughout the state. It's common to hear them stoke fears about what Democrats could do if they win the Senate. It's not common to hear them talk about health care despite their potential voters' interest in the issue. Their Democrat challengers, however, have been all over health care in their own speeches. The Rev. Raphael Warnock kicks off his runoff campaign Nov. 12 to try to unseat Loeffler. Warnock leads Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and has been politically active in the fight to expand Medicaid to uninsured Georgians.\n                \n                    \n                    Sam Whitehead/WABE\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Rev. Raphael Warnock kicks off his runoff campaign Nov. 12 to try to unseat Loeffler. Warnock leads Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and has been politically active in the fight to expand Medicaid to uninsured Georgians. Warnock opened his runoff campaign to unseat Loeffler with a modestly attended Nov. 12 event that focused entirely on health care. So did Ossoff in his bid to win Perdue's seat. \"This is why these Senate runoffs are so vital,\" Ossoff said at a small, physically distanced event Nov. 10 in the shadow of the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta. Ossoff and Warnock support adding a public insurance option to the Affordable Care Act. They also have emphasized the role Democrats will play in resurrecting key parts of the law if the U.S. Supreme Court decides to overturn it. The justices are set to make a ruling next year. \"If the Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Act, it will be up to Congress to decide how to legislate such that preexisting conditions remain covered,\" Ossoff said. Democratic voters such as Janel Green connect with that message. She's from the nearby suburb of Decatur and is fighting breast cancer \u2014 for the second time. Green is worried that if the protections in the Affordable Care Act disappear, her private health insurance might try to deny her coverage. \"I have to worry about whether or not next year in open enrollment that I won't be discriminated against, that I won't have limits that would then potentially end my life,\" she said. More than one-quarter of Georgians have preexisting conditions that could make it hard to get coverage if the Affordable Care Act is struck down, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That possibility is also driving Atlanta resident Herschel Jones to get involved in the runoff. On a recent weekday morning he dropped by an Ossoff campaign office to pick up a yard sign. Jones, who has diabetes, is insured through the Department of Veterans Affairs. He said everyone deserves access to health care. \"It's a main issue, because the Affordable Care Act benefits all those individuals who might have preexisting conditions,\" Jones said. One reason why Ossoff and Warnock are running so much harder on health care than Perdue and Loeffler is because that strategy paid off for Democrats in the general election, said Ken Thorpe, a health policy professor at Emory University. President-elect Joe Biden can thank independent voters for his win in Georgia, Thorpe said, and they were drawn to him because of his promise to uphold Obamacare. \"The threat of potentially losing health insurance in the midst of this pandemic turned out to be probably the major defining issue in the election,\" he said. Polling in the days leading up to the Nov. 3 election showed Democrats were motivated on the issues of health care and the coronavirus pandemic. If Democrats want to win these Senate runoffs in Georgia, Thorpe said, they'll need to continue to stay focused on those issues. That emphasis could help them attract additional moderate voters as well as provide the motivation to entice those in the party base to come out again and cast ballots for a second time. \"The health care issue is the probably main motivating factor that's gonna get Democrats and independents to the polls,\" he continued. But in a state that's traditionally favored Republicans in runoff races, even with a strong health care message, it'll be tough for Ossoff and Warnock to break that trend and unseat the Republicans, Thorpe said.

The Trump administration wants to require the incoming Department of Health and Human Services team to review most HHS regulations by 2023 \u2014 and automatically void those that haven't been assessed by then. The recently proposed rule would require HHS to analyze within 24 months about 2,400 regulations \u2014 rules that affect tens of millions of Americans on everything from Medicare benefits to prescription drug approvals. The move \u2014 widely seen as a political ploy by HHS \u2014 met a fierce backlash from consumer advocates and health providers who fear it would hamstring federal health officials in the Biden administration, just as they're seeking to control the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 280,000 Americans. Critics see the timing as pointed. The proposed rule was issued Nov. 4 \u2014 the day after Election Day, when it appeared President Trump would likely lose his bid for a second term. \"The cynical part of me thinks this is a perfectly designed way to bring the department to a standstill in the next administration,\" says Mary Nelle Trefz, health policy associate at Common Good Iowa, a consumer advocacy group. She says HHS does not have the bandwidth to review all these regulations during the next two years while running its many programs, including Medicaid and Medicare. If the proposal is finalized before Jan. 20, it is likely to be undone by the incoming Biden administration. In the past, incoming administrations have typically frozen new rules that were pending but have not taken effect before Inauguration Day, to give new administrations time to unwind them. But in this case, even that chore, Trefz says, would be time-consuming and add to a long list of duties for HHS officials while they are trying to attack the pandemic. Trump staff denies it is playing politics HHS officials deny their proposal was aimed at the Biden administration. Brian Harrison, chief of staff at the department, says he first sought legal review of the proposal in April. \"Our lawyers moved as fast as they could,\" he says, and the rule was written with the expectation it would be implemented during Trump's second term. \"The outcome of the election had nothing to do with it,\" Harrison says. Democrats and Republicans for the past 40 years have failed to review existing regulations, leaving unnecessary and irrelevant rules on the books, Harrison says. Sunset clauses, or efforts to review funding bills and other legislation, have been popular among conservatives for years. The federal government has occasionally used sunset provisions in legislation, such as the tax cuts enacted during the George W. Bush administration, but it is rare to make department regulations subject to these types of mandatory deadlines. The option is more popular among states, which have adopted varying procedures for measures passed by the legislatures or regulatory boards. Those efforts run the gamut from requiring most initiatives to be reviewed to identifying specific agencies or legislation that must be reconsidered on a regular timetable. Still, it would be unusual for a state to require an analysis of virtually every regulation in one of its agencies \u2014 with a threat to kill the rules if not done in a certain time period. Public comment period has mostly expired HHS accepted public comments on the proposal only through Dec. 4, except for the part of the rule affecting Medicare regulations, which has a Jan. 4 deadline. A final rule is expected before Biden becomes president on Jan. 20. HHS officials don't point to any specific regulations they say are outdated. However, in their supporting material for the proposal, they note in part: \"An artificial-intelligence-driven data analysis of HHS regulations found that 85 percent of department regulations created before 1990 have not been edited; the Department has nearly 300 broken citation references in the Code of Federal Regulations, meaning CFR sections that reference other CFR sections that no longer exist.\" Harrison says the scarcity of reviews is due to \"inertia\" and \"lack of an incentive mechanism.\" \"Many presidents have formally ordered their agencies to review existing regulations, and it has been existing law for 40 years, so simply asking the divisions to review these regulations has been tried for decades and proven to be ineffective,\" Harrison notes. \"We need to incentivize their behaviors,\" he says. With more than 80,000 employees, the department should be able to complete the review of 2,400 rules in 24 months, Harrison adds. Andy Schneider, a research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University who has written about the proposal, says he fears the sunset provision will be one of many actions the Trump team will take to distract the incoming administration. \"It speaks volumes that they waited until the end of the fourth year of the administration to decide that the regulatory process needs to be improved,\" he says. Harrison notes that the Trump team's proposal is authorized by a law signed by President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s requiring federal agencies to review existing rules. But that law has no provision that calls for cutting regulations that are not reviewed within a certain time frame, Schneider says. The proposal says the HHS secretary would have flexibility to stop some regulations from being eliminated \"on a case-by-case basis.\" Cost of rules review: up to $19 million HHS estimates the reviews would cost up to $19 million over two years. Regulations would have to be reviewed every 10 years under the proposal. When he took office in 2017, Trump vowed that for every regulation his administration issued, it would remove two. In July, he said his administration had more than exceeded that goal. \"For every one new regulation added, nearly eight federal regulations have been terminated,\" he said in a Rose Garden speech. The Washington Post Fact Checker has said that claim is based on \"dubious math and values each regulation as having equal weight.\" One of the few groups to endorse the HHS proposal is the National Federation of Independent Business. That group says the Trump administration proposal would alleviate regulatory burdens on small businesses. But other groups, such as the American Academy of Neurology, suggest the proposed rule would limit input from interested parties on changes to existing regulations because it would not follow the usual process of seeking public comments when altering rules. \"The AAN is highly supportive of the current process to modify and rescind regulations through the notice and comment period, as it affords stakeholders the necessary opportunity to provide feedback on proposed regulations prior to changes being implemented,\" the group told HHS. The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, which advises Congress, opposes the proposal. \"MACPAC questions the need for a proposed rule that creates a duplicative and administratively burdensome new process that is likely to create confusion for beneficiaries, states, providers, and managed care plans,\" the group said in a letter this month to HHS. \"The new requirements will create additional unnecessary work that will distract the department and CMS from the critical roles they play in our health care system, Medicaid and CHIP amid the pandemic and its resulting economic challenges.\" It's unclear how the proposed rule would affect long-standing regulations for product safety and standards, says Betsy Booren, senior vice president of the food lobbying group Consumer Brands Association. \"The idea that these regulations would be sunset because a regulations timer went too long is not acceptable,\" she wrote in comments on the proposed rule.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., downplayed Houses losses in this year's elections, pointing out that Democrats made historic gains in 2018. Updated at 10 a.m. ET House Democrats started this month hoping, and preparing, to gain seats in the election. Instead, their once-robust majority in the House has dwindled, and Democrats are on track to begin next year with the slimmest majority in decades. Now members on the progressive left and Democratic Party moderates are again at odds over whose policies won in 2020 and how they should govern as a party. Some Democrats are frustrated that the debate is happening at all. Joe Biden won the presidential election, and Democrats will hold their majority in the House. While control of the Senate is still to be decided, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., returned to Washington, D.C., after the election to celebrate the wins that have already materialized. \"We'll be able to do great things for the American people,\" Pelosi told reporters at a news conference. \"We've lost some battles, but we won the war. We have the gavel.\" But Democrats lost a lot of battles. House Republicans have gained a net seven seats and have advantages in several races that have yet to be called, despite going into the election with the expectation that Democrats could win as many at 15 seats. Polling on both sides of the aisle showed Democrats with advantages in key districts in states like Texas and Indiana, where they hoped to gain new seats. Tight races in places like Iowa and New York broke in favor of Republicans when the votes were tallied. Debate about messaging Democrats' losses have been heavily concentrated in the \"majority-maker\" districts \u2014 areas where Democrats defeated Republicans in 2018. Some progressive members, such as Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., say that isn't a surprise. \"I think people are mourning the loss of some colleagues that wasn't as expected as it should have been,\" Jayapal said in an interview with NPR. \"I think we just have to be real about what happened here. And we should focus on our long-term organizing strategy, because I think that is what is ultimately going to help us.\" Loading... For progressives such as Jayapal, that long-term organizing strategy involves bringing out young, diverse new voters who are energized by progressive policies like \"Medicare for All,\" a $15 minimum wage and an aggressive approach to curbing climate change. Jayapal points to enormous turnout in cities such as Atlanta as an example of what an energized coalition can do. Those voters have boosted Biden's numbers in Georgia, putting him ahead and on the verge of winning that state for Democrats after decades of Republican wins. She and other progressives say that they helped drive the party's national platform to the left on major social issues and that this, in turn, motivated voters to the polls. She says progressives also worked as emissaries for the party in communities that voted in huge numbers this year. \"[Progressives] helped Joe Biden deliver a very progressive agenda,\" Jayapal said. \"That led to this huge turnout of young people, Black and brown and immigrant voters that delivered us victories in these key states.\" Moderates say big progressive turnout in cities and suburbs may drive up Democrats' numbers in statewide and presidential races, but in their closely divided districts, they argue, some progressive messages can turn toxic. Rep. Abigail Spanberger was narrowly reelected in a Virginia district that went for Republicans from 1971 until she won in 2018. She says Democrats need to focus more on proactive messages and passing bills that speak to people, like funding for education and expanded rural broadband. She told NPR the party needs to be communicating to all voters, not just a progressive base, about how those policies impact them. \"I think it's important that we recognize that, you know, while importantly and wonderfully Joe Biden is our president-elect, the man he ran against, our current president, got 70 million Americans to vote for him,\" Spanberger said in an interview. \"We are asking for people to give us the responsibility of legislating. And we have to be clear on what we intend to do with that responsibility.\" \"Defund the police\" cited as main impediment with swing voters Moderates say they've been hamstrung by political slogans that don't actually reflect the policies Democrats have passed \u2014 like \"defund the police.\" House Democrats passed a sweeping police reform package this year called the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. That bill outlaws chokeholds, gives the Justice Department greater power to intervene in use-of-force cases, creates a national registry for police conduct complaints and restructures the pipeline of military equipment to local police departments. It does not defund the police. \"People know what the term 'defund' means,\" Spanberger said. \"I have had people just across the spectrum say they don't want to see police departments defunded.\" But \"defund the police\" was an effective attack line for Republicans in tight races where Democrats lost. One example is Rep. Max Rose, D-N.Y., who lost in a district that was blanketed with an ad of retired New York City police officers talking about how Rose betrayed them. \"He promised us that he was going to support the police, and then he marches with people looking to defund the police,\" recounts an officer in the ad. This division isn't new for Democrats. Pelosi often says the diversity of her caucus extends to some parts of their ideology. That is something Democrats often publicly celebrate, but the divisions become more critical as they look ahead to legislate with President-elect Biden. Both sides of the party are looking for someone to blame as the losses sink in. Some blame the polls. Some blame internal calculations at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The finger-pointing boiled over in a party conference call recently, and DCCC Chairwoman Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., announced a few days later that she would not seek reelection to that leadership job. Pelosi and her top leadership team are expected to be easily reelected to their posts, but the race for who will succeed Bustos has intensified. Rep. Tony Cardenas of California, who is running to lead the DCCC, says it's wrong to argue that the party must choose between either retaining disaffected Republicans and moderates or winning over progressives. \"I think the emphasis of trying to hold on to a certain type of voter is the wrong place to start,\" Cardenas said in an interview with NPR. Cardenas said Democrats can win by connecting with diverse voters and winning their trust. But, he said, the party also must do the basic job of passing bills and getting legislation done. \"Unfortunately, we have a lot of good candidates who their message gets overshadowed by millions of dollars of the Republican message that just literally doesn't even use their own words,\" Cardenas said. \"And those are the kinds of tactics that we're having to combat.\" That's something most Democrats agree on. They say the next election won't be centered on Democrats running against President Trump. They'll be running on a record they plan to build with Biden. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who is competing against Cardenas to run the campaign committee, agreed. Maloney said Democrats in the House will be working on a Biden agenda and will have all of the power and support that being of the party with a president in the White House affords. \"Joe Biden is the perfect president for the moment,\" Maloney said. \"He will help us turn the corner on the pandemic, get our businesses going again, open the economy responsibly and heal the wounds and repair some of the damage from the Trump years.\" But Maloney added that Democrats will also benefit from time. \"I also believe we'll be entering the cycle next time with the pandemic, God willing, in the rearview mirror and an economy that's in full rebound,\" he said. Deciding which elements of the Biden agenda to enact first will be part of the challenge. Progressives want to see health care reforms and elements of the Green New Deal at the top of the list. Biden himself has signaled plans to focus heavily on making the fight against COVID-19 his No. 1 priority. Many Democrats say a tightly tailored focus on the virus, the economy and kitchen-table issues could unite them. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said Democrats need to keep that in mind as they define their agenda. \"We're going to have to do core agenda items like trade deals that level the playing field \u2014 broadband, so that as we're dealing with a pandemic, that urban schools and rural schools have the same access and equal opportunity so that everybody's got an education,\" Dingell said. \"The most important, valuable thing to have, we need to make sure that every young person can afford a college education and not graduate with staggering student debt \u2014 talking about just these issues that matter every day.\" Dingell says that the political environment has strayed far from that basic political work in the Trump years and that Democrats have a chance to win over a wider range of voters by renewing that focus. \"There's more agreement on that,\" she said. \"There's more agreement than disagreement.\"",

Of his many plans to expand insurance coverage, President-elect Joe Biden's simplest strategy is lowering the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60. But the plan is sure to face long odds, even if the Democrats can snag control of the Senate in January by winning two runoff elections in Georgia. Republicans, who fought the creation of Medicare in the 1960s and typically oppose expanding government entitlement programs, are not the biggest obstacle. Instead, the nation's hospitals \u2014 a powerful political force \u2014 are poised to derail any effort. Hospitals fear adding millions of people to Medicare will cost them billions of dollars in revenue. \"Hospitals certainly are not going to be happy with it,\" said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of health policy and management at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Medicare reimbursement rates for patients admitted to hospitals are on average half what commercial or employer-sponsored insurance plans pay. \"It will be a huge lift [in Congress] as the realities of lower Medicare reimbursement rates will activate some powerful interests against this,\" said Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Foundation for Government Accountability. Biden, who turns 78 this month, said his plan will help Americans who retire early and those who are unemployed or can't find jobs with health benefits. \"It reflects the reality that, even after the current crisis ends, older Americans are likely to find it difficult to secure jobs,\" Biden wrote in April. Lowering the Medicare eligibility age is popular. About 85% of Democrats and 69% of Republicans favor allowing those as young as 50 to buy into Medicare, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll from January 2019. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.) Although opposition from the hospital industry is expected to be fierce, it is not the only obstacle to Biden's plan. Critics, especially Republicans on Capitol Hill, will point to the nation's $3 trillion budget deficit as well as the dim outlook for the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. That fund is on track to reach insolvency in 2024. That means there won't be enough money to pay hospitals and nursing homes fully for inpatient care for Medicare beneficiaries. It's also unclear whether expanding Medicare will fit on the Democrats' crowded health agenda, which includes dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly rescuing the Affordable Care Act (if the Supreme Court strikes down part or all of the law in a current case), expanding Obamacare subsidies and lowering drug costs. Biden's proposal is a nod to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, which has advocated for Sen. Bernie Sanders' government-run \"Medicare for All\" health system that would provide universal coverage. Biden opposed that effort, saying the nation could not afford it. He wanted to retain the private health insurance system, which covers 180 million people. To expand coverage, Biden has proposed two major initiatives. In addition to the Medicare eligibility change, he wants Congress to approve a government-run health plan that people could buy into instead of purchasing coverage from insurance companies on their own or through the Obamacare marketplaces. Insurers helped beat back this \"public option\" initiative in 2009 during the congressional debate over the ACA. The appeal of lowering Medicare eligibility to help those without insurance lies with leveraging a popular government program that has low administrative costs. \"It is hard to find a reform idea that is more popular than opening up Medicare\" to people as young as 60, Oberlander said. He said early retirees would like the concept, as would employers, who could save on their health costs as workers gravitate to Medicare. The eligibility age has been set at 65 since Medicare was created in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society reform package. It was designed to coincide with the age when people at that time qualified for Social Security. Today, people generally qualify for early, reduced Social Security benefits at age 62, but full benefits depend on the year you were born, ranging from age 66 to 67. While people can qualify on the basis of other criteria, such as having a disability or end-stage renal disease, 85% of the 57 million Medicare enrollees are in the program simply because they're old enough. Lowering the age to 60 could add as many as 23 million people to Medicare, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Avalere Health. It's unclear, however, if everyone who would be eligible would sign up or if Biden would limit the expansion to the 1.7 million people in that age range who are uninsured and the 3.2 million who buy coverage on their own. Avalere says 3.2 million people in that age group buy coverage on the individual market. While the 60-to-65 group has the lowest uninsured rate (8%) among adults, it has the highest health costs and pays the highest rates for individual coverage, said Cristina Boccuti, director of health policy at West Health, a nonpartisan research group. About 13 million of those between 60 and 65 have coverage through their employer, according to Avalere. While they would not have to drop coverage to join Medicare, they could possibly opt to pay to join the federal program and use it as a wraparound for their existing coverage. Medicare might then pick up costs for some services that the consumers would have to shoulder out of pocket. Some 4 million people between 60 and 65 are enrolled in Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for low-income people. Shifting them to Medicare would make that their primary health insurer, a move that would save states money since they split Medicaid costs with the federal government. Chris Pope, a senior fellow with the conservative Manhattan Institute, said getting health industry support, particularly from hospitals, will be vital for any health coverage expansion. \"Hospitals are very aware about generous commercial rates being replaced by lower Medicare rates,\" he said. \"Members of Congress, a lot of them are close to their hospitals and do not want to see them with a revenue hole,\" he said. President Barack Obama made a deal with the industry on the way to passing the ACA. In exchange for gaining millions of paying customers and lowering their uncompensated care by billions of dollars, the hospital industry agreed to give up future Medicare funds designed to help them cope with the uninsured. Showing the industry's prowess on Capitol Hill, Congress has delayed those funding cuts for more than six years. Jacob Hacker, a Yale University political scientist, noted that expanding Medicare would reduce the number of Americans who rely on employer-sponsored coverage. The pitfalls of the employer system were highlighted in 2020 as millions lost their jobs and their workplace health coverage. Even if they can win the two Georgia seats and take control of the Senate with the vice president breaking any ties, Democrats would be unlikely to pass major legislation without GOP support \u2014 unless they are willing to jettison the long-standing filibuster rule so they can pass most legislation with a simple 51-vote majority instead of 60 votes. Hacker said that slim margin would make it difficult for Democrats to deal with many health issues all at once. \"Congress is not good at parallel processing,\" Hacker said, referring to handling multiple priorities at the same time. \"And the window is relatively short.\" KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

President-elect Joe Biden said Friday, as ballots were still being tabulated in states across the country, that voters had spoken loudly to embrace the policies and principles he campaigned on. \"They have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism,\" Biden said in a late-night speech in Wilmington, Del. \"They made it clear they want the country to come together \u2014 not pull apart.\" Biden followed Saturday night by calling on Democrats and Republicans to come together after the election and pledged to join them. \"And I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate,\" Biden said. \"That's the choice I'll make. And I call on the Congress \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 to make that choice with me.\" Loading... But Biden, who secured enough votes to win the Electoral College on Saturday morning, will face a narrowly divided Congress when he takes office in January. Biden's significant lead in the popular vote did not translate to a Democratic wave in the House and Senate, leaving Biden without the votes necessary to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda in Congress. Democrats maintained control of the House of Representatives but the GOP made gains, picking up at least five seats in the election. Control of the Senate will remain undecided until early January following a pair of runoff elections in Georgia. Republican reaction to Biden's victory has been muted as focus shifts to GOP efforts to defend incumbent Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in those Georgia seats. So far, most Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have not congratulated Biden or acknowledged his victory. But Democrats are already calling those races the linchpin that determines the success of Biden's agenda. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., used Biden's victory as a call to arms in the Georgia races. \"A Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate would be the biggest difference maker to help President-elect Biden deliver for working families across the country and in Georgia where, for too long, they have been denied the help they need by President Trump, Mitch McConnell and a Republican-led Senate,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"The best way to ensure that positive agenda can be carried out and deliver help to working families in Georgia and across the country is to elect Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to the Senate.\" Republicans, like Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, began framing a GOP Senate as a key check on progressive policies well before the final ballots were cast \u2014 a message that will likely be central in the campaigns in Georgia. \"Democrats couldn't eliminate the filibuster and, you know, make D.C. a state \u2014 or Puerto Rico,\" Cornyn told NPR days before the election. \"So it would force the White House and the Senate to compromise and negotiate.\" Regardless of the outcome in Georgia, the victors will have a narrow majority in the Senate. And Democrats will be forced to contend with divisions within their own party on some of the biggest policy items on Biden's list. Among the most controversial is a plan to combat climate change. Democrats themselves are not fully unified on how to approach the issue. Divisions over how quickly and aggressively to move to limit carbon emissions have simmered within the party since progressive lawmakers like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., introduced the Green New Deal \u2014 a plan to eliminate the carbon footprint by 2030 \u2014 back in 2019. Biden has proposed a $2 trillion plan to fight global warming that includes a vast expansion of solar and wind energy, a network of electric vehicle charging stations and a plan to reach zero net-emissions by 2050. But many moderate Democrats are skeptical of those plans and Republicans have mocked the proposal and successfully ran against the proposal in states like Texas and South Dakota. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, who was reelected this week in South Dakota, echoed a message that will likely dominate GOP pushback to many Biden proposals. \"When you think about what they're suggesting, with tax hikes and changes in our economy, they're talking about changes with regard to our energy activity,\" Rounds said late last month. \"They're talking about a 'Green New Deal,' which would cost $90 trillion over 10 years. We can't afford that. And most of us don't think that a President Biden could ever stop the far left from pushing that.\" Passing such a massive climate overhaul would require the kind of months- or years-long political investment that consumed Washington during former President Barack Obama's push to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2009. Such an effort is politically risky with full control of Washington and could be impossible if Republicans control the Senate. Progressive activists are also calling for Biden to move on another issue that divides the party, Medicare for All. Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., both oppose the plan and instead want Obamacare expanded with a public option. But progressives argue that the party has shifted to embrace widespread government-sponsored health care. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted shortly after Biden's victory was announced that every House Democrat who embraced the progressive health plan was reelected or is on track to be reelected. Every single swing-seat House Democrat who endorsed #MedicareForAll won re-election or is on track to win re-election.Every.\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd Single.\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd One.\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd Like climate change, Medicare for All would be an all-consuming political effort in a time when the country is still struggling with a deadly pandemic. And Biden himself has promised to make COVID relief his first priority. \"I want everyone to know that on Day One, we are going to put our plan to control this virus into action,\" Biden said Friday. \"That can't save any of the lives that have been lost, but it will save a lot of lives in the months ahead.\" Biden has consistently promised that one of his top priorities will be to take immediate steps to combat and control the spread of the coronavirus, which has surged in recent weeks. His plan includes investing in expanded testing with a Pandemic Testing Board and a vast Public Health Jobs Corps as well as better tracing capacity and greater production and distribution of personal protective equipment. His plan also includes a plan to boost jobs to aid in economic recovery. In his speech on Saturday, Biden said his administration's work would begin with managing the pandemic and pledged to begin the work as early as next week. \"On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisers to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that starts on Jan. 20, 2021,\" Biden said. \"That plan will be built on a bedrock of science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern.\" His proposal is in line with policies included in several bills Democrats passed in the House. But Republicans have rejected two comprehensive coronavirus packages passed by the House. McConnell has said strong jobs numbers released this month bolster his belief that any COVID-related legislation should be dramatically pared back from Democrats' plans. \"I think it reinforces the argument that I've been making for the last few months that something smaller \u2014 rather than throwing another $3 trillion at this issue \u2014 is more appropriate,\" McConnell told reporters this week in Kentucky. \"With it highly targeted towards things that are directly related to the coronavirus, which we all know is not going away until we get a vaccine.\" Congressional leaders say they hope to pass some COVID relief before the end of this year but Democrats have long insisted that they expect the economy will need further support in 2021.",

Among other things, it will empower scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help set national, evidence-based guidance to stop outbreaks. Updated at 6:49 a.m. ET As coronavirus cases surge around the country, President-elect Joe Biden says voters have given him a mandate to take action. \"Daily cases are skyrocketing,\" Biden said in remarks Friday evening in Wilmington, Del., as the nation waited for the election to be called. \"I want everyone \u2014 everyone \u2014 to know on Day 1, we're going to put our plan to control this virus into action.\" Early Monday, Biden announced a 13-member Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board, to be led by former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. David Kessler, former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith of the Yale University School of Medicine. Many of the voters who helped propel Biden toward the presidency ranked the pandemic as the most important issue facing the United States, according to AP VoteCast data. So how will Biden deliver on their hopes? Specifically, Biden's plan calls for empowering scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help set national, evidence-based guidance to stop outbreaks as well as making significant investments in vaccine distribution, testing and the creation of a public health workforce to carry out contact tracing and other services. \"We have to function as one nation. That means having a national plan,\" Murthy, a key adviser to the Biden campaign, told NPR recently. Murthy said Biden will focus on helping Americans get what they need to keep themselves and their families safe. \"What you're going to see is a laser focus on ensuring that people get ... adequate testing and clear information,\" he said. Murthy said a Biden administration will have a unified message and strategy on how to proceed. \"Rebuilding public trust is about communication. It's about following the science,\" he added. Ezekiel Emanuel, a physician and University of Pennsylvania professor who has briefed Biden on health policy, told NPR he got to see how Biden works during the Obama administration's economic recovery efforts in 2009, which Biden managed as vice president. \"You're going to have rigorous evaluation and constant refinement\" of policies and strategies, he said. While working on the Recovery Act, Emanuel said, Biden \"was constantly asking, 'Are we doing the right thing?' \" and looking to adjust midcourse, if necessary. \"He's a very practical guy,\" Emanuel said. Here's a summary of Biden's proposals: This report is drawn from a more extended analysis of the Biden pandemic plan published on Oct. 28. 1. Set shared guidance for slowing community spread Under Biden's plan, the CDC will be directed to provide specific guidance \u2014 based on the degree of viral spread in a community \u2014 for \"how to open schools, open businesses,\" Emanuel says, or when to impose restrictions on gathering sizes or when stay-at-home orders may be called for. It would create a national \"pandemic dashboard\" to share this information with the public. This is a strategy recommended by a top group of public health experts, who released a framework for assessing community risk. And Biden says he'd work with every governor to make mask-wearing in public mandatory in their state. Many states already have mask mandates, but though research suggests that universal masking could save more than 100,000 lives, there's currently no nationwide coordination or requirement. 2. Seriously ramp up testing The Biden campaign has said the goal is to \"ensure that all Americans have access to regular, reliable and free testing.\" His administration will work to double the number of drive-through testing sites and invest in \"next-generation testing,\" including home tests and instant tests. \"It's not enough to know in seven days or five days or three days whether or not you have COVID,\" Biden recently said on CBS' 60 Minutes. If there's a long lag time, a person may spread the disease unwittingly while waiting for results. There are currently several home test kits that give quick results without being sent to a laboratory in development, but none are yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. While there has been a significant expansion in testing, \"testing is still not available and affordable to all people across the country,\" Murthy told NPR. 3. Hire thousands of public health workers The Biden team pledges to \"mobilize\" 100,000 Americans to work with local organizations around the country to perform contact tracing and other health services for populations at high risk for COVID-19. The idea is to empower local communities and health departments to assist people with challenges such as food insecurity and affordable housing. \"Imagine a public health workforce that was also helping train school officials in how to reopen safely,\" Murthy told NPR. Or helping run public education campaigns about a vaccine and how to stay safe in the pandemic. \"Think about a workforce that was diverse, that looked like the country that we're trying to serve,\" Murthy said. 4. Help people get health insurance Millions of American have lost health insurance during the pandemic. Biden's coronavirus plan proposes to have the federal government cover 100% of the costs of COBRA coverage for the duration of the crisis. \"So when people lose their employer-based health insurance, they can stay on that insurance, given the moment we are in,\" Stef Feldman, Biden's national policy director, told NPR. In addition, Biden will push to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, expanding coverage by making more people eligible for premium subsidies. Biden hopes also to push for expansion of Medicaid in states that have yet to do so, and he has proposed making Medicare coverage available to Americans beginning at age 60 (instead of 65). During the pandemic, several governors asked the Trump administration to reopen the federal Obamacare marketplace for a special enrollment period. Feldman has told NPR that Biden would do so immediately after his inauguration to allow those who've lost insurance to sign up for new plans. She called it \"a basic step that President Trump has refused to do.\" 5. Create a caregiving workforce During the pandemic, Biden says many families are struggling to find affordable care for their children, aging relatives or loved ones with disabilities. \"At the same time, professional caregivers have either lost their jobs or continue to work while putting their lives at risk without sufficient pay,\" his campaign plan noted. Biden plans to work with states to speed up waiting lists for Medicaid-paid care in homes. In addition, the president-elect supports a variety of steps to expand caregiving, including ensuring access to preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds and supporting caregivers through job training and improved benefits and protections. Expanding opportunities in the female-dominated caregiving workforce would play a dual role in both helping families, and helping improve women's employment outlook, said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, noting that this pandemic-fueled economic crisis has hit women harder. 6. Boost vaccine distribution and personal protective equipment production States will need a lot of money to distribute a vaccine and make sure it gets to everyone who wants it. There are complex logistics that will require planning and resources. Currently state governors are asking for more guidance and financial assistance. The Biden team proposes investing $25 billion in a vaccine manufacturing and distribution plan \"that will guarantee it gets to every American, cost-free.\" The president-elect also wants to solve the shortages of personal protective equipment that have plagued the U.S. health care system since the pandemic began. The Biden team says after the inauguration, it will work to make sure more of these critical supplies are produced and distributed \"rather than leave states, cities, tribes, and territories to fend for themselves.\" Biden says he'd use the Defense Production Act to increase production of masks, face shields and other personal protective equipment so that supply exceeds demand.",

As Election Day nears, the pandemic looms large. Amid a surge in new cases, the coronavirus has changed the way we live, work and \u2014 perhaps \u2014 how some Americans will vote. As President Trump makes the case that his leadership has saved lives in the pandemic and ushered in record-fast vaccine and therapeutics development, Joe Biden has described Trump's handling of COVID-19 as \"totally irresponsible\" and points to American's health as the nation's top domestic issue. Trump's approach to handling the pandemic is clear from his record. His administration has delegated much of the authority for the coronavirus response to states, including testing and contact tracing. He's invested heavily in vaccine development. He signed two coronavirus relief packages and has indicated he'd sign another one after the election. But what would Biden do? Biden's campaign has a seven-point plan to beat COVID-19 and other proposals for health care and economic recovery that support that vision. NPR asked his advisers for details on his approach, which includes some familiar elements, as well as some less-expected ones. 1. Set consistent, evidence-based guidance to stop outbreaks If Biden wins the election, \"You would see an approach that's driven by science and by scientists,\" says physician Vivek Murthy, who is a key adviser to the Biden campaign on COVID-19. And he'd focus on uniting states around some common practices, says Ezekiel Emanuel, a physician and University of Pennsylvania professor who has briefed Biden on health policy but has no formal campaign position. Instead of \"different states doing different things, the goal would be to get all the states singing from the same hymnal,\" Emanuel says. For instance, Biden's plan says it would direct the CDC to provide specific guidance \u2014 based on the degree of viral spread in a community \u2014 for when to open or close businesses and schools, when to impose restrictions on gathering sizes or when stay-home orders may be called for. \"Social distancing is not a light switch. It is a dial,\" the Biden campaign states in its plan. It would create a national \"pandemic dashboard\" to share this information. This is a strategy recommended by a top group of public health experts, who released a framework for assessing community risk. And, Biden is calling on every American to wear a mask when they are close to people outside their household. He says he'd work with every governor to make this mandatory in their state. Many states already have mask mandates, but at a time when research suggests that universal masking could save more than 100,000 lives, there's currently no nationwide coordination or requirement. 2. Seriously ramp up testing The Biden campaign says the goal is to \"ensure that all Americans have access to regular, reliable and free testing.\" It would work to double the number of drive-through testing sites and invest in \"next-generation testing\" including home tests and instant tests. \"It's not enough to know in seven days or five days or three days whether or not you have COVID,\" Biden said on CBS' 60 Minutes. If there's a long lag time, a person may spread the disease unwittingly while waiting for results. There are currently several home test kits that give quick results without being sent to a laboratory in development, but none are yet FDA-approved. While there has been a significant expansion in testing, \"we're still encountering shortages,\" Murthy says. \"Testing is still not available and affordable to all people across the country, he says. 3. Establish a U.S. public health jobs corps The Biden campaign pledges to \"mobilize\" 100,000 Americans to work with local organizations around the country to perform contact tracing and other services that would help address unmet needs in populations at high risk for COVID-19. These workers would initially help with contact tracing around the country, and would also shore up local health departments to address other pandemic needs, Murthy says. \"We know that people are struggling,\" he says, and the idea is to empower local communities and local health departments to assist people with challenges such as food insecurity and affordable housing. \"Imagine a public health workforce that was also helping train school officials in how to reopen safely,\" Murthy says. Or helping run public education campaigns about a vaccine and how to stay safe in the pandemic. \"Think about a workforce that was diverse, that looked like the country that we're trying to serve,\" Murthy says. This investment would be paid for by increasing taxes on corporations and wealthier Americans. 4. Help people get health insurance Millions of American have lost health insurance during the pandemic. Biden's coronavirus plan proposes to have the federal government cover 100% of the costs of COBRA coverage for the duration of the crisis. \"So when people lose their employer-based health insurance, they can stay on that insurance, given the moment we are in and the pandemic,\" says Stef Feldman, Biden's national policy director. In addition, Biden would push to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. \"That means expanding coverage,\" Murthy says, for instance by making more people eligible for premium subsidies. Biden would also push for expansion of Medicaid in states that have still yet to do so, his advisers say, and he has proposed making Medicare coverage available to Americans beginning at age 60 (instead of 65). During the pandemic, several governors asked the Trump administration to reopen the federal Obamacare marketplace for a special enrollment period. \"One of the most immediate steps Vice President Biden would be able to take is to reopen open enrollment as needed so people who have lost insurance can sign up for new coverage,\" Feldman says, calling it \"a basic step that President Trump has refused to do.\" 5. Create a caregiving workforce During the pandemic, Biden says many families are struggling to find affordable care for their children, aging relatives or loved ones with disabilities. \"At the same time, professional caregivers have either lost their jobs or continue to work while putting their lives at risk without sufficient pay,\" his campaign plan notes. There are thousands of people who would like to receive care in their homes, who are covered by Medicaid, explains Murthy, but are on a waiting list that is as long as five years. \"Vice President Biden would work with states to close that gap and make sure that we have Medicaid-funded, home-based care providers to care for our older loved ones,\" Murthy says. Biden supports a variety of steps to expand caregiving including ensuring access to preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds and also supporting caregivers through job training and improved benefits and protections. The Biden campaign says these initiatives would cost $775 billion over 10 years and would be paid for, in part, by rolling back tax breaks on high earners. Expanding opportunities in the female-dominated caregiving workforce would play a dual role in both helping families, and helping improve women's employment outlook, explains Sherry Glied, who is dean of New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, noting that this pandemic-fueled economic crisis has hit women harder. \"This really gives us an opportunity to sort of address two policy objectives with one policy step,\" Glied says. She is not an adviser to Biden, but has written a perspective in the New England Journal of Medicine on how policies to address the impact of COVID-19 could shift under a new president. 6. Bolster resources for vaccine distribution and PPE production States will need a lot of money to distribute a vaccine and make sure it gets to everyone who wants it. There are complex logistics that will require planning and resources. For instance, states may need freezers to store their vaccines, and given how many people are hesitant to be vaccinated, they will need public education materials and guidance. Currently state governors are asking for more guidance and financial assistance. The Biden campaign proposes investing $25 billion in a vaccine manufacturing and distribution plan \"that will guarantee it gets to every American, cost-free.\" The Biden campaign also wants to solve the PPE shortages that have plagued the U.S. health care system since the pandemic began, stating that it would produce more of these critical supplies, \"rather than leave states, cities, tribes, and territories to fend for themselves.\" While Trump made limited use of the Defense Production Act to increase ventilator production, Biden says he'd use it to increase production of masks, face shields and other personal protective equipment so that supply exceeds demand.",

Rallies and in-person events have been a key part of the campaign strategy, even in the midst of the pandemic.\n                \n                    \n                    Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters cheer during a Trump rally in Pensacola, Fla. Rallies and in-person events have been a key part of the campaign strategy, even in the midst of the pandemic. President Trump is closing out his campaign for reelection way behind in fundraising and trailing in the polls, both nationally and key swing states. Nearly 60 million people have already voted and time is running out before Nov. 3, Election Day. His campaign claims to be in a good position, citing an army of volunteers and the large crowds Trump has drawn even in the middle of a pandemic with surging coronavirus cases. But you don't need a top secret campaign memo to see where Trump is looking to shore up support. The president is saying it out loud at his now nearly nonstop rallies, with specific messages for seniors and suburban women now a regular part of his stump speeches. \"Do we have any seniors in the room?\" Trump asked at a rally in Florida. And then there's this line, a version of which he has used at numerous stops: \"Can I ask you to do me a favor? Suburban women, will you please like me?\" he said at a recent rally in Pennsylvania. Finally! Suburban women are flocking over to us. They realize that I am saving the Suburbs - the American Dream! I terminated the Regulation that would bring projects and crime to Suburbia. Not on my watch! Biden will bring the Regulation back, but bigger and worse. Another way to gauge a campaign's priorities is to look where it is spending time and money. Here's a telling example: On Facebook, the Trump campaign has poured nearly $1 million into ads starting in late September, using a page called Women for Trump. That's according to Bully Pulpit Interactive, an ad firm that tracks campaign spending on Facebook and Google and has worked with Democratic candidates. \"It seems they're making a last-minute plea for women votes,\" said Benjamin Clark, a founding partner at the firm. The ads are targeted to \"Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina. All kind of must-wins for the president.\" Trump is also spending time and money in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Georgia. That group includes both states he narrowly won in 2016, and others he won easily but is having to work harder for this time. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign seems as if it is on the air everywhere in the final lap, running local ads in 19 states and spending millions during major sporting events, like the World Series. In contrast, Trump is only advertising in 11 states and is getting outspent in most of them, according to the tracking firm Ad Analytics. .@JoeBiden has officially surpassed Michael Bloomberg as the highest spending candidate of 2019-2020 and all time. \"We very much like where we're at,\" Bill Stepien, Trump's campaign manager, told reporters, making the best of a less-than-desirable situation. \"We have more than sufficient air cover.\" The latest campaign finance reports show Biden with more than three times as much cash on hand as Trump. Biden had $162 million cash on hand in the period ending October 14. Trump's campaign had just $43 million. The advantage shows in Biden's TV ad buying totals. Ad Analytics pegs Biden as spending more than twice as much on advertising than Trump did last week. After Thursday's debate, Stepien announced that Trump pulled in his strongest-ever small-dollar fundraising haul. But it's not clear just how much he raised and how much it will help. The Republican National Committee is also pitching in with ads in four swing states and Iowa. The ads are aimed at senior citizens, making dire predictions about a Biden presidency hurting Medicare. Stepien argues television ads and fundraising dollars don't tell the whole story of the race. \"We're actually running a real campaign,\" said Stepien, who has knocked Biden's small, socially distanced events. \"You know, a campaign with voter contact. A campaign with events. We like our plan better.\" Stepien points to voter registration drives bringing more people into the Republican Party, and he has continued to argue that any losses in support from seniors or women could be made up with support from Latino and African American voters. It's not clear that math works, but Trump's campaign continues to project confidence. Stepien also says the Trump campaign has a secret weapon: more than 2.5 million volunteers, who just last week connected with 10 million voters. One of those volunteers is Adele Amico, who lives in Estero, Fla. She has been putting in about 40 hours a week for Trump at this point. On a recent afternoon, she took a reporter's call while driving between working a shift watching polls and going to set up chairs for an Ivanka Trump event with members of her town's Republican club. \"I just called a bunch of members and I said, 'Look: we need to put up a thousand chairs. Can you come out and help?' and they go, 'Absolutely,' \" Amico said. She says volunteers in Florida are knocking on doors, making phone calls and reaching out to people who requested absentee ballots to make sure they send them in before the deadline. \"It's pretty intense,\" she said. Campaigns are always boasting about their volunteer armies, their get-out-the-vote efforts \u2014 and it's always impossible to tell whether it's really as good as they claim. It's even harder to make comparisons now because of how the coronavirus has changed traditional campaign and voter activities. But what is clear is that based on polling and where the candidates are trying to compete, Trump has a narrower path to victory. Or as the president said at a recent rally, he has to \"run the table\" under dramatically different circumstances than he did four years ago.",

For the most part, it was a civil night.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump, left, and former Vice President Joe Biden met for the last presidential debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn. For the most part, it was a civil night. President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden met for their second and final debate as tens of millions of Americans have already voted. A deeply divided country begins its final sprint to Election Day amid the coronavirus pandemic, and it's unclear how many voters have yet to make up their minds. Here are five takeaways from the debate in Nashville, Tenn., a much different \u2014 and far more civil \u2014 night than the last encounter. 1. There was a real debate The first debate between Trump and Biden was unwatchable. It was overwhelmed by interruptions and cross-talk, disregard for the moderator and name-calling \u2014 all largely on the part of the president. New rules imposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates included a mute button operated by a staffer for the CPD that turned off each candidate's microphone for the first two minutes of his opponent's speaking time at the beginning of each debate topic. Moderator Kristen Welker of NBC News skillfully kept the conversation moving. She followed up and pressed for answers and fairly gave both candidates opportunities to respond to the other's comments. Welker pushed back when the candidates attempted to run over time or tried to change the subject. She was firm and her no-nonsense approach held the candidates to task. Trump dropped in the polls after the first debate and got advice from Republicans to tone it down this time. Thursday night he was more measured and attempted to stay on message. Biden was also more disciplined and came prepared to address personal attacks the Trump campaign signaled beforehand it was going to make about his son Hunter's business dealings. 2. The coronavirus is still the driving force in the election The 2020 election remains focused on Trump's handling of the coronavirus, and it was the subject of Welker's first question. Both candidates tested negative for the coronavirus prior to entering the venue on Thursday, and those in the small audience were required to wear masks. Members of the Trump family adhered to the rules, donning masks and appearing to keep them on after conspicuously refusing to do so during the first debate. The two candidates' approaches and attitudes could not have been more different on the pandemic. Biden warned a \"dark winter\" was looming and that with 220,000 Americans dead the president had failed from the outset to take control of the response to the virus. \"Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of the America,\" Biden said. Trump repeatedly claimed that his approach saved millions of lives and that \"we're rounding the turn.\" After testing positive himself following the last debate, the president acknowledged he had personal experience with the disease but argued it was manageable, saying, \"I had it. And I got better.\" He repeated his claim that a vaccine was weeks away, but when pressed admitted: \"It's not a guarantee.\" Trump said \"it has a good chance by the end of the year\" to be approved, and that he had a plan lined up for the military to help distribute millions of doses. The president attempted to pivot to the economic impact of returning to restrictions, arguing that Biden wanted to shut down the country, saying: \"We can't keep this country closed. This is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs.\" Biden retorted, referring to the virus, \"He says that we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it.\" 3. Health care debate pitted \"Bidencare\" versus ending Obamacare Democrats have made the GOP effort to end Obamacare a key line of attack in the campaign, both in the presidential election and in congressional races, and it's proven effective. Biden dubbed his plan for the Affordable Care Act \"Bidencare\" during Thursday night's debate. Call it Bidencare. pic.twitter.com/Ng3Fvk4fpY The president vowed to protect preexisting conditions, but Biden hammered him for not presenting a plan to replace the ACA despite four years of indicating one was imminent. The Supreme Court is slated to hear a challenge to the law brought by the Trump administration one week after the election. As he's done before, Biden linked health care concerns over the coronavirus pandemic to the administration's efforts to dismantle the ACA. Earlier on Thursday, the president released raw video from a taped interview with the CBS News program 60 Minutes where he was pressed about his position on the ACA. Trump declared, \"I hope that they end it. It'll be so good if they end it.\" And during the debate he continued to sharply criticize the ACA, which 10 years after it was implemented is more popular and has proven to be a political plus for Democrats. \"What we'd like to do is terminate it,\" the president said, also noting that he \"terminated\" the individual mandate that required people to enroll in coverage plans or pay a fine. The president maintained Biden's plan amounted to socialized medicine that would threaten Medicare, the popular government health coverage for seniors. He equated Biden's plan with that of other Democrats who during the primary pushed for a more sweeping \"Medicare for All\" program. But Biden disavowed those proposals, saying, \"I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them\" on health care. 4. Trump attacked Biden as a typical politician, engaged in corruption Trump won in 2016 in part by arguing he wasn't a politician, that he was a businessman who was going to Washington to \"drain the swamp.\" He has been trying in the past couple of weeks to reprise that strategy, and to paint Biden as a corrupt Washington figure who has a 47-year career in government without much to show for it. Even though reelection races for incumbents are usually referendums on their first terms, Trump has talked less about his own record and more about Biden's. Going into the debate, the Trump campaign signaled the president would home in on Biden's son Hunter's work with overseas businesses, arguing it led to the former vice president personally enriching himself. The president pointed to reports in the New York Post about alleged emails from Hunter that described efforts to create a business venture in China that included money for his father and his uncle. But the authenticity of the material cited in the news reports has not been verified \u2014 it was given to the Post by Trump's attorney and ally, Rudy Giuliani. And Biden's campaign denies the allegations. One of the Trump campaign's guests at the debate was a man who claims to be a former business associate of Hunter Biden who said he had direct knowledge that Joe Biden was involved in his son's business dealings and was planning to meet with Senate GOP investigators about the matter. Biden was ready for the attack. \"I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life,\" he said. He argued that Trump's focus on the Biden family was intended to distract from the problems facing voters' families. The president waved off Biden's answers as changing the subject like other \"typical politicians,\" saying, \"I'm not a typical politician. That's why I got elected.\" The president made multiple references to Biden receiving millions from foreign governments, but didn't provide any evidence to support his claims. Biden pointed out that many of Trump's allegations about the Biden family were proven false during the impeachment probe. With less than two weeks before Election Day, Trump's effort to change the focus of the campaign may not connect and could have been confusing to voters because his charges were less than clear. Also many voters are focused on the economy and health care, not on unsupported allegations of corruption. Biden did use the exchange to bring up a New York Times report that revealed Trump himself had a Chinese bank account, which raised questions about Trump's own tax payments to China and refusal to release his U.S. tax returns. The president said he believed he closed the China account and claimed again he will release his returns once an IRS audit is completed. The IRS is on record that the audit does not prevent Trump from releasing his returns now. 5. The debate may not matter More than 40 million people have already voted, and recent polls show a very small sliver of the electorate is persuadable this close to the election. Even Biden appeared bored, and near the end of the debate checked his watch. Both campaigns chiefly wanted to avoid any major mistakes in the last debate, and both candidates delivered. Now their focus in the final stretch will be to get out supporters and see how states process an unprecedented number of ballots from those voting early or by mail to avoid lengthy lines during a continuing national health crisis.",

President Trump won the senior vote four years ago.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden speaks about his vision for older Americans Tuesday in Pembroke Pines, Fla. President Trump won the senior vote four years ago. With just three weeks left in the presidential race, Democratic nominee Joe Biden and President Trump are heavily courting senior citizens, a crucial voting bloc that has been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic. \"[Trump's] never been focused on you. His handling of this pandemic has been erratic, just like his presidency has been. And it has prevented Florida seniors and people all across the country from getting the relief that they need,\" Biden said Tuesday in remarks, delivered with a mask on, in Pembroke Pines, Fla. Seniors make up a sizeable share of voters in the all-important toss-up state. Biden, who's 77, slammed Trump, 74, for minimizing the severity of the pandemic, which has now claimed the lives of more than 215,000 Americans, calling his continued downplaying of the virus \"reckless.\" \"How many empty chairs are around the dining room table tonight because of his negligence? How many people's hearts are broken?\" Biden asked. He added: \"While he throws super-spreader parties at the White House, where Republicans hug each other without concern of the consequences, how many of you have been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months?\" The former vice president also said Trump's policy goals would undercut the funding for Medicare and Social Security. In a statement, Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director, said Biden is \"lying\" and \"trying to mislead and scare seniors for political reasons.\" Speaking at his own event in Florida, on Monday night in Sanford, the president accused Biden of plans to cut Social Security and Medicare himself. It was Trump's first campaign trip outside of Washington, D.C., since his hospitalization for COVID-19. Last week, the president released a video about his bout with the illness that he addressed to seniors, \"MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD!\" TO MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD! pic.twitter.com/38DbQtUxEu The Trump campaign has also launched a series of ads targeting older voters in key states, including one that asks bluntly: \"Who's better for seniors?\" Another ad proclaims that the Trump administration \"protect[ed] our seniors\" throughout the pandemic and features a clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, appearing to laud the president, saying, \"I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more.\" In fact, those words were taken from a Fox News interview in which Fauci praised the work being done on the coronavirus task force. Fauci recently told CNN he didn't consent to being featured in the new ad and that his words were taken out of context. The Trump campaign has pushed back, saying Fauci's words were accurate. Trump won seniors in 2016 The dueling appeals to older voters come as Trump lags behind Biden in polls \u2014 and notably among seniors. A recent Fox News national survey found Biden leading narrowly among likely voters ages 65 and older. Some polls have shown bigger margins. A CNN survey of likely voters had Biden up big among those 65 years and older, with 60% for Biden and 39% for Trump. The poll also showed 78% of respondents 65 and older listed the coronavirus outbreak as an \"extremely important factor\" in determining who they'll vote for. If Biden's leads with seniors hold up, it would be a reversal from 2016. According to the Pew Research Center, Trump enjoyed a 9-point advantage over Democrat Hillary Clinton among voters 65+ (53% to 44%). Voters 60 and older consistently turn out to vote at higher levels than other age groups.",

This was maybe the worst presidential debate in American history. If this was supposed to be a boxing match, it instead turned into President Trump jumping on the ropes, refusing to come down, the referee trying to coax him off, and Joe Biden standing in the middle of the ring with his gloves on and a confused look on his face. Trump doesn't play by anyone's rules, even those he's agreed to beforehand. He's prided himself on that. But even by his standards, what Trump did Tuesday night crossed many lines. More than 200,000 Americans are dead from the coronavirus pandemic. And instead of a serious debate about the direction of the country, Trump sent it off the rails. Most charitably, both former Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who helped Trump prep for the debate, said he was \"too hot.\" \"I think the president overplayed his hand tonight,\" Santorum said on CNN. Here are six takeaways from the first Trump-Biden debate. 1. Even for Trump, he went too far For part of the debate, Trump looked like he was controlling the stage. He interrupted constantly and tried to distract, deflect and interject. That's fairly typical Trump behavior, but a few things in particular were egregious. When Biden, for example, was talking about his late son Beau's military service, Trump went in on Biden's other son, Hunter, and brought up his past cocaine use. It backfired. Biden, looking directly to the camera, turned something he rarely talks about into a positive, sympathetic moment. \"My son, like a lot of people you know at home, he had a drug problem,\" Biden said. \"He's overtaken it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it. And I'm proud of him.\" Later, when Trump was asked to denounce white supremacists and militia groups \u2014 and specifically the far-right extremist group Proud Boys \u2014 he instead said this: \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.\" And then he denounced left-wing groups. (Proud Boys is now using Trump's words as part of a new logo.) What's more, Trump would not urge his followers to remain peaceful as votes are counted, including if there are delays in reporting the results. \"I'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen,\" Trump said, adding, \"If it's a fair election, I am 100% on board. If I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that.\" 2. Trump likely did nothing to expand beyond his base Trump's base will probably love his performance. But coming into the debate, Trump was behind in the polls. That's no secret. He needed to try to win back suburban and independent voters, both of whom he won in 2016 and who have largely abandoned him this cycle. So who was this performance for exactly? Trump repeated his \"law and order\" appeal to white, suburban voters and tried to force Biden to repeat the words. But Biden didn't take the bait and pivoted, calling for \"law and order with justice where people are treated fairly.\" And Biden said this about Trump and the nature of his appeal. \"He wouldn't know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn,\" Biden said. \"I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated.\" 3. Biden missed opportunities This was not Biden's cleanest debate. He was not crisp, was often flummoxed \u2014 as was moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News \u2014 by Trump's antics. \"Will you shut up, man?\" said Biden while trying to make a point. He also called Trump a \"clown\" more than once. Biden missed some opportunities. For example, when Trump was talking about the role of masks in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, Biden could have interjected more forcefully to talk about Trump's largely maskless rallies. When Trump claimed his rallies caused no harm, Biden could have pointed out the spike in coronavirus cases after Trump's Tulsa, Okla., rally. The former vice president had some stumbles and some moments that weren't great for him, like not answering if he would add justices to the Supreme Court \u2014 \"pack the court\" \u2014 if Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's nominee to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is confirmed. That was likely overshadowed by Trump's demeanor, but for the next debate \u2014 if there is one \u2014 Biden's team will need to try to sharpen him up. 4. Trump tried to tie Biden to the far left, but it didn't work Trump tried his darndest to paint Biden as a socialist, or at least beholden to the \"radical left.\" But on issue after issue \u2014 \"Medicare for All,\" defunding the police, the Green New Deal \u2014 Biden disavowed policies the Trump campaign has tried to lasso to him. Biden just restated his positions, and they all line up with the middle of the electorate, far more than Trump's policy positions do. That might have harmed Biden with the progressive left, particularly when it comes to the Green New Deal, if Trump hadn't gone quite so Trump. 5. Trump's response on his handling of COVID-19 was more of the same More than 200,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and coronavirus cases are spiking again in some parts of the country. And yet Trump's tactic when defending himself on his management of the pandemic was to insult Biden's smarts. \"He panicked or just looked at the stock market, one of the two, because guess what?\" Biden said. \"A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter a lot quicker.\" Trump's response? \"Did you use the word 'smart?' \" Trump asked rhetorically, adding, \"You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word 'smart' with me.\" Loading... Trump said he disagreed with his own experts on a vaccine timeline, insisting it would soon be widely available. But making rosy assertions to the public is exactly what got him in trouble after Bob Woodward's latest book, Rage, revealed that Trump privately knew the virus was worse than he let on publicly. He tried to claim Biden would have made the pandemic worse. \"Two million would be dead now,\" he said. But Trump is president, and, on average, a majority of Americans say they disapprove of the job he's doing handling the coronavirus. 6. Good luck to the next moderator Before the debate, Wallace said his goal was to be \"invisible.\" By the end, he might have wished he was. The role was no easy task, and the next presidential debate, Oct. 15, is set to be moderated by the far more mild-mannered Steve Scully of C-SPAN. After the first presidential debate of the 2004 election, Internet conspiracies abounded about a mysterious bulge in the back of President George W. Bush's jacket. Some believed, unfoundedly, that there was a communications system rigged up by White House advisers to coach him. Bush dismissed that, cracking wise. \"I guess the assumption was that if I were straying off course they would ... kind of like a hunting dog, they would punch a buzzer, and I would jerk back into place,\" Bush said afterward. Maybe something to look into.",

A viewer watching the Republican National Convention on Monday night could be forgiven for thinking that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were not the Democratic Party's presidential and vice presidential nominees but were leading a different ticket altogether. \"Biden, Harris and their socialist comrades will fundamentally change this nation,\" Trump campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle warned. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, asserted that Biden would be taking orders from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the four congresswomen known as the \"Squad.\" \"Their vision for America is socialism,\" Haley said. \"And we know that socialism has failed everywhere.\" RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said, \"Democrats have chosen to go down the road to socialism.\" The \"S\" word is a charge Republicans have leveled against Democrats for decades, says Thomas Alan Schwartz, a Vanderbilt University history and political science professor. \"Democrats have tended, through regulation and other ways, to be more empowering of the federal government and in regulating the economy than the Republicans,\" Schwartz says, \"and this has been called socialism.\" Schwartz says the term socialism actually refers to a political system in which the state is in charge of the economy and provides not only social welfare services such as health care, but where \"all sorts of other things are in state control, including the large sections of the private economy.\" In 1945, when President Harry Truman, a Democrat, first proposed a national health insurance program, which evolved to what we now know as Medicare, Republicans opposed it, arguing it was socialist. And earlier New Deal programs, including Social Security, were similarly labeled. Now Republicans are trying to hang two Democratic proposals, the Green New Deal and \"Medicare for All,\" on Biden, even though he supports neither, and has established a long political record as a moderate and pragmatist. And while Sanders and \"Squad\" members Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib identify as Democratic Socialists, their vision is more aligned with Scandinavian nations such as Denmark and Sweden, where universal health care and a wide range of social benefits \u2014 and higher taxes \u2014 are the norm, but capitalism still prevails, rather than with countries such as Venezuela and Cuba, where the state does control major industries, and authoritarians rule. Republicans level the socialist charge possibly in an effort to scare voters into opposing the Democratic ticket and supporting their candidate, but Schwartz says he doesn't think it's that frightening a label anymore. \"Clearly the ways in which socialist was a dirty word during the Cold War have declined considerably,\" he says. \"The fact that Bernie Sanders could mount such a challenge and be so strong despite being a self-professed socialist, I think does show that socialism doesn't scare many American voters anymore.\" Ironically, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have themselves blurred the lines between capitalism and socialism, passing the CARES Act to aid businesses and providing $600 payments to unemployed workers in the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has also opened federal coffers to rescue farmers who have been hurt by his trade disputes with China and other nations. \"President Trump,\" Schwartz says, \"is very fond of using the government and being willing to spend money and do things that might be, in another context, considered socialist.\"",

After former first lady Michelle Obama's foreboding address Monday about the consequences of a second term for President Trump, and her urgent appeal that people \"vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it,\" the second night of the Democratic National Convention focused on building the case for how Biden would restore a country struggling in an economic and public health crisis. The main messenger \u2014 Jill Biden \u2014 delivered an intimate speech that wove together her career as an educator with her story about how her partnership with Joe Biden began with an effort to heal a broken and grieving family. Democrats continued to highlight their priority for quality and affordable health care with an emotional appeal from an activist stricken with Lou Gehrig's disease. After Democrats focused the 2018 midterms on the threat of the GOP dismantling the Affordable Care Act, the Biden campaign and congressional candidates are confident the issue is an effective one to use in suburban battlegrounds around the country this fall. Tuesday's lineup featured elder Democratic statesmen including two former presidents, but their appearances highlighted how much the party has changed, and how the energy of younger stars is focused on an agenda far more progressive than these leaders envisioned when they served in office decades earlier. And because of the coronavirus pandemic, for the first time the party nominated its candidate for president in a highly produced remote roll call vote. Biden, in his third run for the White House, finally secured the nomination, setting up a contentious general election against Trump. Some takeaways from the second of the four-night Democratic National Convention: 1. Jill Biden worked to put character on the ballot and offer a hopeful message Walking through an empty hallway and classroom in the Delaware school where she taught when Joe Biden served in the U.S. Senate, Jill Biden delivered a live speech that started out with a subtle critique of the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic by highlighting the dynamic that most teachers and parents are struggling with as the school year begins \u2014 remote learning. \"[T]his quiet is heavy,\" she said, adding, \"you can hear the anxiety that echoes down empty hallways.\" Jill Biden was introduced by a video with family members discussing her personal strength and resiliency as a young woman who met a widower who had lost his wife and baby daughter in a car crash and was raising two young sons. The story of Joe Biden's family tragedy at the age of 30 just weeks after winning his Senate seat in 1972 has been a key part of his political biography. His wife's recounting suggested the experience will translate to her role as first lady, and her husband's role as president. \"How do you make a broken family whole? The same way you make a nation whole,\" she said. \"With love and understanding and with small acts of kindness. With bravery. With unwavering faith.\" Unlike Michelle Obama's direct attack on Trump Monday night, Jill Biden didn't mention the current president's name. She offered a more hopeful message, recounting stories about how her husband rebounded from searing family tragedies. And she took a positive view about how people are picking up the pieces during a hard time. \"Across the country, educators, parents, first responders, Americans of all walks of life are putting their shoulders back, fighting for each other,\" she said. \"We haven't given up.\" Loading... While enthusiasm for Joe Biden's candidacy may not be intense in a party that had significant divisions during the primaries, the message from Jill Biden was that her husband's character contrasts with that of the current occupant of the Oval Office \u2014 and that his lifelong career of public service demonstrates he has the experience to work on issues that matter to people concerned about the future. She set aside ideological issues and made the argument that Joe Biden's moral compass is what the country needs. 2. Health care remains the central issue Democrats want to wield against the GOP, but they are still divided on what course to take One of the emotional speeches of the night came from Ady Barkan, a health care advocate stricken with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who delivered his remarks from a wheelchair via a computer-generated voice. \"Even during this terrible crisis, Donald Trump and Republican politicians are trying to take away millions of people's health insurance,\" Barkan said. Barkan gained national attention for his efforts pushing \"Medicare for All.\" He backed Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign as the broad field of Democratic candidates debated the merits of a massive overhaul and what it would mean to transition from private health care plans to a government system. Biden has backed expanding the Affordable Care Act \u2014 not Medicare for All, one issue that continues to frustrate those on the left of the party who remain disappointed that then-President Obama set aside his plans for a single-payer system. But Barkan didn't press specifically for Medicare for All in his speech, or bring up the internal divide \u2014 instead he warned about the \"existential threat of another four years of this president.\" Other speakers hit on health care, too \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., pledged if Democrats took control of the Senate they would \"make health care affordable for all.\" The House Democrats' campaign arm has also signaled that it believes health care is the single most important issue animating voters this fall \u2014 especially as more Americans see the impact of the coronavirus. 3. There was a focus on Democratic elders when energy in the party is coming from younger, progressive elected leaders Tuesday's program included testimonials from former presidents who are always familiar faces at political conventions. Former President Bill Clinton, who has had prime slots at conventions for decades and is famous for lengthy remarks, gave a condensed address in the more subdued setting of his living room. Like Jill Biden, he made character an issue \u2014 and attacked Donald Trump. \"Now you have to decide whether to renew his contract or hire someone else,\" Clinton said. \"If you want a president who defines the job as spending hours a day watching TV and zapping people on social media, he's your man.\" Former President Jimmy Carter, who is 95 and ailing, voiced-over a video that featured pictures of Biden endorsing him during his 1976 campaign. 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry spoke about his long relationship with Biden during his time in the Senate and as secretary of state during the Obama administration. Nostalgia for former Democratic leaders is a quadrennial tradition, and this year's remote convention observed it, too. Caroline Kennedy, daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, and her son John Schlossberg, were given prominent roles, which they used to describe Biden's ties to the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, arguing Biden was a bridge from the past to the new generation of Democrats focused on climate change. \"In this election, our future is on the ballot. For my generation, it will define the rest of our lives,\" Schlossberg said. But the brand of politics that many of these party elders espoused is no longer in vogue. Clinton campaigned for president as a centrist and famously promised during a 1996 State of the Union address that \"the era of big government is over.\" But progressive Democrats that Biden singles out as future leaders are pushing for the return of big government \u2014 in health care, in the energy sector, in education and the environment. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive freshman, has built a national profile as \"AOC\" and pushed party leaders to embrace Medicare for All. Despite being a social media sensation and popular draw as a surrogate for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign, she was given a brief and early slot on Tuesday's program \u2014 something fellow progressives viewed as a slight after Republican John Kasich, the former Ohio governor and 2016 GOP presidential candidate, got prime-time billing Monday night. Biden has talked about being a bridge to the next generation, but so far the convention has not given much prominence to younger figures on the left \u2014 perhaps because the party is hoping to convince wavering independents and moderates that Biden needs their support to change direction in the White House. Ocasio-Cortez, who was allotted less than two minutes, presented a long list of issues she said needed to be addressed, \"including guaranteed health care, higher education, living wages and labor rights for all people in the United States.\" Instead of picking one rising star to deliver the keynote speech \u2014 a convention tradition \u2014 Democrats picked 17 young elected leaders in an effort to demonstrate the party's diversity. Stacey Abrams, the Black former Georgia state legislator who ran a close race for governor in 2018, was one who already had a national profile. But others included Robert Garcia, an immigrant from Peru who was the first openly gay mayor elected in Long Beach, Calif.; Colin Allred, an African American freshman representing a competitive congressional district in Texas; and Sam Park, the first openly gay man elected to the state legislature in Georgia. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg downplayed the prominence of older party leaders and discounted any gap between their views and those of the newer generation of elected leaders. \"You heard from every part of our party and every part of our country,\" he told NPR after Tuesday's program. 4. The remote roll call vote nominating Biden was better than the traditional convention floor routine With delegates unable to travel to Milwaukee, convention organizers decided to show Democrats from each state and territory via satellite link \u2014 some live and some taped \u2014 formally granting Joe Biden the title of his party's presidential nominee. Traditionally, the lengthy roll call vote features brief speeches from the convention floor as delegates boast about their state's key industries or political leaders. Instead, the screen presented an impressive television production that gave the viewer a tour of the country and featured some familiar faces like Buttigieg; Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey outside Biden's childhood home in Scranton; and speaking from Charlottesville, Va., Khizr Khan, the Gold Star parent who criticized Trump at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Rhode Island's turn featured a state senator discussing the challenges facing restaurants during the pandemic, standing on the beach touting the \"calamari comeback.\" Despite the novelty of the virtual roll call vote, once Biden was officially named the nominee, Democrats capped it off with \"Celebration,\" a 1980 song by Kool and the Gang \u2014 proving that some convention musical traditions never die.",

            "article_content": "Jill Biden, along with former President Bill Clinton, will headline the second night of the Democratic National Convention. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Stacey Abrams are also expected to speak.  LEILA FADEL, HOST: The Democrats are back on your screens and your radio later this evening. On night two of the Democratic National Convention, we'll hear from former second lady Jill Biden and former President Bill Clinton. New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will also speak briefly. NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow is in Delaware, where Joe Biden will accept the Democratic nomination on Thursday. And he joins us now. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey. Good afternoon. FADEL: So night two of the convention is typically when there's a keynote address, which often highlights an up-and-coming voice. But like so much else, things are really different this year. Tell us about that. DETROW: Yeah, this is one of those things that people have focused on when they talk about what might be lost or what might be different going away from the full convention. This is often an opportunity for a rising star to leave a mark. And the most famous example by far was State Senator Barack Obama in 2004, who became an instant political star even before he was elected to the Senate. There's been a couple other examples of keynotes that really changed careers. New York Governor Mario Cuomo is an example from 1984. This year, the Democrats are going with 17 different speakers. It's a broad geographic and demographic mix of younger rising leaders - most prominent Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate who's now focusing on voting rights. You'll also have voices like Pennsylvania Congressman Conor Lamb, who gained attention as the first Democrat in 2018 to flip a House seat using that general approach that the Biden campaign is now taking of trying to appeal to dissatisfied moderate voters. So this really gets to the way the Democrats have changed the convention as a whole. You're going to have a lot more voices from all over the country but speaking for shorter moments. FADEL: So the final remarks tonight go to Joe Biden's wife, the former second lady Jill Biden. What's notable to you about her presence? DETROW: Yeah. This will be a moment of national introduction for Jill Biden, probably. She was, of course, the second lady for eight years, but she was often overshadowed by Michelle Obama, who, of course, spoke last night and really forcefully denounced President Trump and urged people to vote this fall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE OBAMA: So if you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this - if you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me. They can, and they will if we don't make a change in this election. If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it. DETROW: You know, very few people in this country can give a speech like Michelle Obama, and I think Jill Biden will give a very different speech. She's a lifelong educator. She continued to teach community college when Joe Biden was vice president. And tonight, she'll be speaking from her first classroom in Delaware. And based on what we've heard from the campaign, we can expect her to tell people about Joe Biden's character, his life story. And she'll also be speaking from a school about something that millions of families are thinking a lot about right now, and that's how coronavirus has disrupted school and how to start to get back to the normal classroom experience that just seems thousands of miles away for students all over the country. FADEL: That's on lots of people's minds. So run down the programming list for us some. What else can people expect? DETROW: You're going to hear from two former Democratic presidents, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez will briefly nominate Bernie Sanders, and that'll kick off the roll call, which is traditionally a moment of a crowded convention floor. But this will be a montage from states all over the country. Also, you'll hear from Ady Barkan, who's a high-profile activist who's pushed for \"Medicare for All.\" Of course, Joe Biden does not support that, but Barkan has endorsed him anyway and will explain why. FADEL: That's NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow. Scott, thank you. DETROW: Thank you. FADEL: We'll have live special coverage of the DNC tonight at 9 p.m. Eastern.

Kamala Harris has been criticized.\n                \n                    \n                    Patrick Semansky/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump's amplification of a false \"birther\" conspiracy against Sen. Kamala Harris has been criticized. Twenty-four hours after entertaining and amplifying a false and racist birther conspiracy aimed at Sen. Kamala Harris, President Trump had an opportunity to correct the record. He didn't. Neither did his son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner. For Trump, this is a return to familiar territory. \"Unfortunately, this might have been inevitable,\" said Doug Heye, a former Republican National Committee communications director. He said that when former Vice President Joe Biden first picked Harris as his running mate, he saw tweets from Democrats saying: \"Here comes the racism and sexism.\" Heye says he rolled his eyes recalling Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin being mocked as \"Caribou Barbie.\" But then, Trump went there, with Harris. \"The problem with that is, [the Democrats] weren't wrong and they weren't wrong because this is where Trump went and Trump supporters went immediately,\" Heye said. Heye argues it's not a good strategy but says Trump is likely returning to it because he's down in the polls and the American public is worried about the coronavirus and overwhelmingly disapproves of the president's handling of the crisis. \"This is an old playbook,\" said Amanda Renteria, who was political director for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The official response from the Trump campaign was to criticize Harris as a \"radical\" and \"phony.\" That's the script campaign surrogates stuck to during a call with reporters earlier this week. \"You know, today we are talking about Joe Biden's new running mate, Kamala Harris, or as we know her, Phony Kamala,\" said Stacy Washington, a Black Voices for Trump Advisory Board member, mispronouncing the senator's first name. Washington pointed to Harris' co-sponsorship of Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" bill and general support of the Green New Deal. \"It couldn't be clearer that with this VP pick, the extreme liberal takeover of Joe Biden is complete. You don't have to take our word for it,\" Washington said. \"Just look at the record of Joe Biden's new handler.\" The language was colorful, but the focus was ostensibly on policy. Trump, though, immediately went more personal, describing Harris as a \"mad woman,\" \"disrespectful,\" \"nasty\" and \"angry,\" playing into the old racist and sexist trope of the angry black woman. On Thursday, given the opportunity to reject a birther conspiracy making the rounds on the Internet, Trump threw fuel on it. \"I heard it today, that she doesn't meet the requirements,\" Trump said when asked at a White House press briefing about a Newsweek opinion piece suggesting Harris' immigrant parents mean she shouldn't qualify to be vice president or president. \"And by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer.\" There is no question. Harris was born in Oakland, Calif. Yes, her father was an immigrant from Jamaica, her mother from India. But Harris is just as much a natural-born American as Trump, whose own mother emigrated from Scotland. And so as he often does, Trump did add a dose of plausible deniability. \"I have no idea if that's right,\" Trump said. \"I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked out before she gets chosen to run for vice president.\" This has echoes of language he has used in the past when pushing forward birther conspiracies about Barack Obama. \"I have no idea,\" Trump said in a 2013 ABC interview of whether Obama was born in the U.S., even after the president had released his birth certificate. \"Some people say that was not his birth certificate.\" Birtherism is in the DNA of Trump's political rise \u2014 from Obama to his 2016 primary opponent Ted Cruz. \"You know based on things that I've learned over the last few days, many lawyers are coming out saying he doesn't even have a right to run,\" Trump said of Cruz. During the same campaign, he briefly toyed with the idea that Sen. Marco Rubio, whose parents are Cuban may not be allowed to run, before moving on. Trump always uses the same arm's-length, \"just asking questions\" formula to inject conspiracies into the American bloodstream. On CBS this Friday, Kushner, Trump son-in-law and top adviser, went to a defense Trump allies use regularly. \"He just said that he had no idea whether that's right or wrong,\" said Kushner. \"I don't see that as promoting it. But look, at the end of the day, it's something that's out there.\" Having it out there, circulating, with an air of suspicion, would seem to be the goal. \"If Republicans and Trump decide to go after Harris instead of Biden and say that she's the Biden whisperer from the left, there is the substance there for them to do so,\" said Heye, who wrote about the birther conspiracy on CNN's website and said Republicans should condemn it. \"And just like there was plenty of substance for Trump to go after Obama, these are the places he goes back to. It almost is his safe space.\" The Trump campaign has struggled to settle on a message attacking Harris that really sticks, much as they have toiled unsuccessfully to truly hurt Biden, said Renteria. So, she says, the birther stuff, is a way for Trump to signal to his base that America is changing and that they should be afraid. \"You know the energy that you've seen of women of color of breaking barriers, sons and daughters, a daughter of an immigrant,\" Renteria said, \"he's immediately trying to strip that down and say that's not American.\"",

Kamala Harris \u2014 with some veering into sexist and racist tropes.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Trump is returning to familiar territory - entertaining and amplifying a racist birther conspiracy. This time, he's targeting Sen. Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's pick to be vice president. Since her selection was announced, the Biden campaign has raised more than $50 million, and the Trump campaign is struggling to land on a consistent response. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: If you want to know what a campaign's official talking points are, just tune into one of their press calls. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STACY WASHINGTON: You know, today, we're talking about Joe Biden's new running mate, Camala (ph) Harris, or as we know her, Phony Camala. KEITH: That was Stacy Washington, a Black Voices for Trump advisory board member, earlier this week on a call set up by the campaign.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate. The senator from California has also been the state attorney general and the district attorney of San Francisco.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: All right. We just heard about some of the reasons Sen. Kamala Harris is an historic vice presidential nominee. Well, here is another reason that is important to people in California. She is the first Democrat from that state on a major party's presidential ticket. Scott Shafer joins us from member station KQED in San Francisco. Welcome to the program. SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: Thanks, Ari. SHAPIRO: You've covered Kamala Harris for nearly two decades, starting with her election as a district attorney in San Francisco. First, tell us about her background as a DA. SHAFER: Yeah, well, Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, Calif. We heard her dad was from Jamaica. Her mom came to the U.S. from India. And Harris got her start in local politics here in San Francisco. In 2003, she was a deputy prosecutor in the San Francisco DA's office. And the DA, at the time, was seen by many people as kind of soft on crime and generally incompetent. And she ran against him as a political novice and won with help from some labor unions, including the police. And here's the thing. She ran as an opponent of the death penalty, and within months of taking office, a San Francisco police officer was shot and killed. And true to her word, she declined to seek the death penalty, but that caused an uproar from people like Sen. Dianne Feinstein, along with rank-and-file cops. And as a result, I think she kind of tacked to the middle, trying to mend fences with law enforcement groups. And in 2010, she then ran for California attorney general, and she very narrowly won, just barely defeating the Republican DA from Los Angeles. She was reelected in 2014 and then won a Senate seat two years later. SHAPIRO: Interesting history there - so as attorney general and now as senator, how do people in California view her? What kind of reputation does she have? SHAFER: Well, it's been mixed. When she ran for president, Harris marketed herself as a progressive prosecutor, someone who was, you know, tough on crime but also aware that the criminal justice system is biased against people of color. And there was some truth to that. You know, she supported rehabilitation programs and some criminal justice reforms to help drug offenders, for example, avoid long prison terms. But critics said that she didn't always live up to that image that she tried to paint. For example, she was slow to support the legalization of marijuana, far slower than, say, Gavin Newsom and many other Democrats in California. She also did not have support for holding police accountable. For example, independent reviews of deadly police shootings when she was AG - she didn't support that. She also appealed when a death sentence was overturned by the courts, even though she opposes capital punishment. SHAPIRO: So we've been hearing national reaction. What has the reaction in California to this announcement been, including from more progressive Democrats? SHAFER: Well, as you can imagine, there's a sense of pride for sure. Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who replaced Harris as AG, noted the historic nature of Harris being Black and South Asian, and he likes the fact that she's been a civil and criminal prosecutor. He also noted that she brings a lot of West Coast energy to the nation in terms of its thinking on issues like climate change, the environment, civil rights and social justice. Now, on the left, there's less enthusiasm for Harris. Many supporters of Bernie Sanders, for example - and remember; he won the California primary in March. They're calling Harris a, quote, \"political weathervane.\" They note that she was first for \"Medicare for All,\" then against it. And they feel she failed for years to hold police accountable for misconduct in California and then turned around and touted her commitment to police reform after George Floyd was killed. But, you know, I also talked to former California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who was Harris' predecessor in the Senate. And she noted this election isn't going to be about Kamala Harris' record but about Donald Trump's and Joe Biden's. SHAPIRO: And what are California Republicans saying about the choice of Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate? SHAFER: Well, Orange County Republicans in Southern California say - and I'm quoting here - \"today's announcement should be clear to every American that Joe Biden is no moderate. In selecting Harris, a San Francisco liberal, as his running mate, he will oversee the most liberal administration in American history.\" And they're adding that she failed to prosecute dangerous criminals, although they don't give any examples. They do point out that as AG, she went after low-income parents whose kids were chronically truant, and that is true. And they also say that her selection guarantees that Democrats' calls for defunding police departments will become national policy. You know, just to be clear, Harris has never endorsed defunding police departments, nor has Joe Biden. SHAPIRO: That is Scott Shafer of member station KQED in San Francisco. Thanks a lot. SHAFER: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: And let's pick up on the question of quite how the White House and the sitting president are going to react to today's big news of the pick of Kamala Harris. I want to bring in NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez. Hey there. FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ, BYLINE: Hi there. KELLY: So President Trump, I know, was briefing reporters tonight. I also looked at the top of his Twitter feed. He's got a new pinned tweet, which we will get to in a second. What did he have to say when he was talking to journalists tonight? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Yeah. He took very quick aim at Kamala Harris and Joe Biden for the pick. He spent - you know, he didn't really have much time talking about - in the press conference and the coronavirus briefing. And he focused most of that time on Kamala Harris. He kind of nonchalantly said he was surprised by the pick, saying Kamala Harris, you know, did very poorly in the primaries. He called her a liar and said she favors raising taxes and wants to cut military funding. He also accused her of being against fracking and said that she favors socialized medicine. Some of these were things from the - her own run for presidency. And he also said she was extraordinary nasty to his SCOTUS nominee, his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. KELLY: The president's reelection campaign does not appear to have been surprised by this. They had a campaign ad ready to go, which is what I was referencing, which is now the top pinned tweet on the president's Twitter account. What's it say? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, yeah. Right. Not at all - just minutes after Biden announced this, President Trump tweeted out that ad targeting Harris. And that ad, you know, basically serves as probably a preview of future attacks from the campaign. It cites her position on \"Medicare for All,\" police reform that she pushed during her campaign. He accuses her - the ad accuses her of embracing the radical left. They have Republicans portraying Biden as kind of a puppet of more liberal politicians and that she is the one who's going to be really leading. The Republican National Committee chairman - chairwoman; pardon me - Ronna McDaniel actually came out almost as quickly, saying in a statement that Biden didn't pick a vice president candidate but a person who would really be in charge for the next four years if he wins. KELLY: Ouch, ouch - harsh words there from Ronna McDaniel. OK, that is NPR's White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez. Thank you. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

Updated at 7:25 p.m. ET Democrats met remotely Monday afternoon to approve a lengthy policy platform that seeks to balance the interests of the Democratic Party's more moderate and liberal factions. The virtual meeting came three weeks ahead of what will be one of the strangest party conventions in U.S. history: No delegates and few Democratic dignitaries will travel to Milwaukee to nominate former Vice President Joe Biden to be the party's standard-bearer. Instead, the convention will be held mostly remotely, with only Biden and a few other speakers appearing from Milwaukee. The draft platform, released last week, draws heavily from a report issued this month by joint task forces organized by Biden and his onetime campaign rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. It tries to bridge the gap between Sanders' progressive politics and Biden's more moderate approach to governing. Dozens of Democratic members considered amendments to the plan Monday. They approved amended language opposing President Trump's deployment of federal agents to quell protests in Portland and other cities, as well as planks affirming support for unions, and for expanding paid sick leave. By Monday evening, the Democratic National Committee had not shared the exact language of the amendments. The draft party document released last week endorses universal health care and makes it clear that low- or no-cost coverage for every American is the party's eventual goal. Rather than backing a single mandatory government-run health insurance program, however, it calls for adding a public option to the existing Affordable Care Act. The platform does nod to \"Medicare for All,\" the policy backed by Sanders, saying: \"We are proud our party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and those who support a Medicare for All approach.\" The platform also sets aggressive goals for combating climate change, including making all American power plants carbon neutral by 2035 and adding 500 million solar panels and 60,000 wind turbines to the country's electricity grid within the next five years. It also calls for a $15 minimum wage, mandatory paid family leave, more federal gun control, broad changes to federal sentencing guidelines and drug laws, and many other changes that most Democratic candidates for Congress and the White House have supported for years. Platform committee co-chair Denis McDonough, who served as former President Barack Obama's chief of staff, called it the \"boldest Democratic platform in American history.\" Still, anticipating virtual floor fights and frustration from progressive activists who want the party to set an even more aggressive policy course, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said at the top of the committee meeting that \"we should never confuse unity with unanimity, nor should we confuse debate with division.\" Indeed, as the platform committee meeting went on, several proposed amendments were rejected, including an attempt to shift platform language to fully support Medicare for all, and another to more forcefully condemn Israel's treatment of Palestinians. Like most Zoom meetings in 2020, the Democrats' committee session had its buffering blips, unintentional mute moments and cross-talk. But the Democrats' attempt to vote virtually was still more than Republicans tried: Trump and Republican Party leaders have decided to adopt the party's 2016 platform in full at their convention next month, rather than craft new language.",

            "article_content": "We look at President's re-election strategy now that the economy isn't making a fast recovery and coronavirus cases are rising. We also look at his rival, Vice President Joe Biden's policy agendas.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: It is a year and an election year like none other. More than 140,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus. The number of daily deaths continues to rapidly climb, so much so that the CDC is now projecting by August 8, there could be as many as 170,000 deaths. Millions of Americans are infected, and millions are out of work. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us now. Good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Those are sobering numbers. It seems clear now that the president knows he cannot tell this triumphant story that he was hoping to tell on beating the pandemic or bringing about an economic recovery. LIASSON: That's right. The president originally wanted to run on a kind of triumphant story about the great economy. Then he wanted to run on a COVID-going-away story or an economy-bouncing-back story. Right now, both of those are very hard, if not impossible, for him to do. And this was the week that the polls really got worse for the president. Remember, polls are a snapshot, not a prediction. But two polls showed him with a - with Joe Biden with a double-digit lead over President Trump. And the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that people think the country is on the wrong track by 72%. That's very high. And it's never a good sign for an incumbent. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's talk about the Democratic nominee, Vice President Joe Biden. He has been rolling out his policies. In a TV interview today, the - President Trump took a shot at Vice President Biden's police reforms that he has proposed with Fox News's Chris Wallace refuting his claims. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And Biden wants to defund the police. CHRIS WALLACE: Sir, he does not. TRUMP: Look. He signed a charter with Bernie Sanders. WALLACE: It says nothing about defunding the police. TRUMP: Oh, really? It says abolish. It says - let's go. WALLACE: All right. Well... TRUMP: Get me the charter, please. WALLACE: All right. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, Biden's charter indeed does not say anything about defunding the police. So what does it say? LIASSON: Joe Biden has been very clear that he opposes the defund the police movement, but he has said that some funding for police departments should be redirected to other services like counseling, mental health care. He has also said that police forces are too heavily armed with militarized equipment. He's talked about - he says, the last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into your neighborhood. So that's where he is. He has not been in favor of defunding the police or abolishing the police. GARCIA-NAVARRO: He's rolled out a number of other policy agendas as well. What can you tell us about those? Are they just an indictment of President Trump's policies, or does he lay out his own vision for the future? LIASSON: No. Joe Biden is trying to go beyond a heavily anti-Trump measure and lay out his own vision for the future. He has talked about much more government investment in the economy, in low-income housing, in low-income schools, free community college. He has not endorsed the Green New Deal, but he has come out with a pretty ambitious environmental agenda. He wants to cut U.S. carbon emissions by 2050. He wants to spend $500 million on solar panels. On health care, he has still stuck to the middle ground in the Democratic debate. He doesn't want mandatory \"Medicare for All,\" but he does want to add a public option to Obamacare. And he has tried to stick to the middle ground on things like fracking. He doesn't want an outright ban, but no new permits on federal lands. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Finally, Mara, we only have a few seconds left. The president was silent for a long time on the death of Congressman John Lewis. It was at least half a day before he tweeted very brief condolences. LIASSON: He did tweet out something that was grammatically strange. He said, quote, \"saddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing. Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family.\" And he also ordered American flags to be flown at half-staff for the rest of the day on Saturday yesterday. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And that is national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you so much. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Now the former Colorado governor is running for U.S. Senate \u2014 and locked in a battle for the Democratic primary. A progressive shift underway in Colorado Democratic politics is spotlighted Tuesday in the primary for a U.S. Senate race that will likely help decide control of the chamber. The contest between former Gov. John Hickenlooper and former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff is the marquee race on Tuesday, but other themes are at play elsewhere, as voters also head to the polls in Utah and Oklahoma: Here are five races to watch in the three states: Senate (Democratic) \u2014 Hickenlooper vs. Romanoff Colorado's shift left in the past several elections has given Democrats hope of taking over this seat from incumbent Republican Sen. Cory Gardner. It's one of the most critical states to Democrats' hopes of regaining control of the Senate. Democrats thought they had a better-than-even-money chance of winning when Hickenlooper entered the race. But the centrist Democrat has hit a primary stumbling block against Romanoff. Romanoff has embraced the populist left, supporting cornerstone progressive policies like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, issues Hickenlooper disagrees with. That combined with Colorado's Democratic political shift from more moderate to progressive and multiple Hickenlooper miscues have made this a tighter race than most thought it would be. Hickenlooper has the lead in polling and fundraising, but Colorado's Independent Ethics Commission announced in early June that the former governor had violated the state's ethics law for accepting large gifts from corporations in 2018. And he has faced criticism on race. He mistakenly said George Floyd was fatally shot by police, rather than as a result of an officer's knee on his neck. And he said the Black Lives Matter movement meant \"every life matters,\" an answer he walked back afterward. But Romanoff is no shoo-in either. He's lost races before, and Republicans think he'd be the easier opponent against Gardner, who has tacked to the center. Loading... 3rd Congressional District (Republican and Democratic) Republican Rep. Scott Tipton, who's held his seat for just under a decade, is facing a primary challenge from businesswoman Lauren Boebert, a more extreme cultural conservative who entertains the QAnon conspiracy theory and owns a restaurant where the servers are allowed to openly carry guns. Boebert has criticized Tipton for supporting bipartisan legislation, including the first coronavirus aid bill, the CARES Act. That said, Tipton has President Trump's backing and maintains a steep fundraising lead over Boebert heading into Tuesday's contest. Two Democrats are also competing for Tipton's seat \u2014 former state Rep. Diane Mitsch Bush, who is looking for a rematch against Tipton, and businessman James Iacino \u2014 though the district is expected to remain Republican. Trump won this district by 12 points in 2016.

He's trying to win back the governorship.\n                \n                    \n                    Pavel Golovkin/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Utah Gov. and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman walks at the Kremlin in Moscow in 2017. He's trying to win back the governorship. Governor's (Republican) \u2014 Tight race between Cox and Huntsman The Republican primary, which will likely decide the governorship, is a close one. And former Gov. Huntsman is looking to make a comeback. But he faces current Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox. A recent Salt Lake Chamber survey found the race a statistical dead heat, with Cox ahead 30% to 29%. Also on the ballot are former state House Speaker Greg Hughes and former state Republican party Chair Thomas Wright. Cox is currently leading Utah's COVID-19 task force and is facing criticism from the other candidates for the level of precaution he's taken, something he stands by. Loading... 4th Congressional District (Republican) \u2014 Can Democrat McAdams be beaten? Four GOP challengers are competing here with the goal of taking on Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams this fall. McAdams was elected in 2018 by a razor-thin margin and is the only Democrat representing Utah on the federal level. The Republicans running range from moderate to more conservative, and all significantly trail their Democratic opponent in fundraising. Former NFL player Burgess Owens led in a May poll and maintains a slight fundraising edge among his Republican opponents. The primary comes just three months after McAdams announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and went on to experience severe symptoms. \"I'm young; I'm 45 years old; I'm healthy; I exercise every day, and it hit me really hard,\" he said in an April interview after recovering. This is a right-leaning district, but Trump's unpopularity in Utah, and with Mormons in particular, means the Republican who emerges from the primary won't be able to ride this president's coattails the way he or she might with a more traditional Republican at the top of the ticket. Even though Trump won this district by 7 points in 2016, McAdams is still the favorite. Loading... 5th Congressional District (Republican) \u2014 Can Democrat Horn hold her seat? After winning her seat in 2018 by just over 1 percentage point, Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn faces a tough reelection campaign and is one of Republicans' top targets. The district has historically been Republican-held with Horn's win being the first Democratic victory in decades. Horn does have a large fundraising lead compared to her Republican opponents, raising more than $3 million. State Sen. Stephanie Bice holds the highest fundraising out of the Republicans, raising more than $1 million. Bice has been endorsed by rising GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, who received national attention for her role pushing back against Democrats during the impeachment inquiry. But Bice is facing some opposition from at least one fiscal conservative group. She was outraged at an ad from the Club for Growth attacking her for voting for a tax increase, but that ad showed her picture on screen with convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein, who, the ad claims, benefited from her policies.

But he's made missteps that have led some voters to question whether they can support him ahead of the state's Tuesday primary.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is considered one of the Democrats' strongest candidates for flipping a Republican-controlled Senate seat this fall. But he's made missteps that have led some voters to question whether they can support him ahead of the state's Tuesday primary. Colorado voters could well decide this fall which party controls the U.S. Senate. But first, on Tuesday, voters will pick the Democrat to challenge GOP Sen. Cory Gardner. Former Gov. John Hickenlooper is the national party's first choice for the nomination, but his campaign has hit some snags in recent weeks. He was a two-term governor, former mayor of Denver and had a short-lived presidential bid. The other name on the ballot is former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, who is less well-known in Colorado and running to the left as the more progressive candidate. Romanoff has unsuccessfully run for Congress twice before. Among the first-time voters watching these candidates is 18-year-old Emma Tang of Colorado Springs. Earlier in the race, she volunteered for one of the two Black women who had been running for Senate in what had been a crowded, diverse field of mostly female candidates. \"At this point, I'm just so torn that my conscience doesn't want me to vote for either candidate,\" Tang said. As a child of Taiwanese immigrants, Tang said she doesn't support Romanoff's endorsement of a tough immigration law earlier in his career, back in 2006. He has since apologized, but she said she doesn't think he's done enough to rectify it. Former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, here in 2014, is running for the Democratic Senate nomination as a more progressive alternative to Hickenlooper.\n                \n                    \n                    Doug Pensinger/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption As for Hickenlooper, she said she thinks he's run a sloppy campaign. She sees him as too soft on the environment and has concerns about his answer to a question in a racial justice forum during the height of the George Floyd protests in Denver. When asked what the term Black Lives Matter meant to him, Hickenlooper responded, \"Black lives matter means that every life matters and that the color of a person's skin has nothing to do with the richness of their lives.\" It was a problematic answer for Tang. \"I feel like he should have done some research on 'all lives matter' versus 'Black Lives Matter' because that's been all over the news, all over social media,\" she said. \"I think there's nothing he could do or say now that would honestly make me want to vote for him.\" Hickenlooper later apologized and said he \"stepped on my own words around Black Lives Matter.\" \"There is a time where we have to step back and recognize that slavery is a nagging, persistent shame of this country that's denied the promise of equality for far too long, to far too many people,\" Hickenlooper continued. Colorado Black Women for Political Action has not yet endorsed anyone in the race. The group's president, Tamra DeBrady, who asked Hickenlooper the question, said his answer was both telling and disappointing. \"Everybody understands 'all lives matter,' that's not what it's about,\" she said. \"It's about understanding the importance of Black lives, especially being in a society that seems to over and over again, show us and treat us like our lives have no value.\" A series of mistakes Hickenlooper's answer is one of several mistakes that Carlos Valverde, a community activist and the state director of the Colorado Working Families Party, thinks could make the primary race closer than he thought it might be. During a televised debate Hickenlooper mistakenly said Floyd was shot, and then a video surfaced from 2014 where he compared politicians to slaves. \"Given Hickenlooper's name ID, given the amount of money he has to buy TV ads, given the support from really establishment Democrats, I would have said he was gonna run away with this thing fairly easily,\" said Valverde, whose group is not endorsing a candidate. \"And I would say right now, Romanoff has the momentum.\" Another problem for Hickenlooper is that the state's Independent Ethics Commission determined he ran afoul of Colorado's gift ban in two cases when he was governor. Hickenlooper defied a subpoena to testify remotely in the ethics commission hearing. He argued that it would violate his due process rights before eventually he backed down and testified. If Hickenlooper wins the nomination, these issues are not expected to go away. \"Any campaign worth their salt will continue to try to keep those narratives on the minds of voters, absolutely,\" Democratic political consultant Sheena Kadi said. \"I would expect Gardner's team to continue to do that.\" \"A little bit bumbling\" And a lot of money has flowed in to help Hickenlooper in the final weeks. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Senate Majority PAC spent nearly $1.5 million on ad buys supporting Hickenlooper. Let's Turn Colorado Blue, a recently formed super PAC, launched a $1.1 million ad campaign attacking Romanoff over his immigration record. \"Hickenlooper always, in my opinion, has been a little bit bumbling, and I think sometimes it's hard and maybe I'm making an excuse for him. I don't know. I think his ethics violation was absolutely ludicrous on his part,\" said Democratic voter Jennifer Riley from northwest Colorado. Despite her frustrations, Riley said she would still back Hickenlooper and feels he has the broadest appeal to compete against Gardner. Hickenlooper led the state through an economic boom and recovery, and unlike his primary opponent, he is more aligned with moderate Democrats and doesn't back the Green New Deal or \"Medicare for All.\" \"I'm OK with moderate,\" Riley said. \"I'm OK with compromise. When he was governor, he did compromise, and he got people on both sides of the aisle to support him.\" Her husband, however, retired teacher Steve Martinson, has been on the fence. He pointed out that the supposed front-runner has given Republicans plenty of ammunition to use against him should he win. \"He's saying that the Republicans are going after him with everything they can 'cause they are afraid of him and that there may be some truth to that. But he should have handled it straight on,\" Martinson said of the ethics complaint. Even with these campaign stumbles, in recent days Martinson has come around to the idea that Hickenlooper may be the most electable candidate. Long track record in Colorado politics Hickenlooper's long track record in Colorado politics is why many Democratic insiders, such as state House Speaker KC Becker, said the former governor may be somewhat insulated from his recent stumbles. \"He has always come across as someone who's really relatable and friendly. And that's an important trait in a time when things are so divisive,\" Becker said. \"So I think people see that and like it, and even with some missteps that's going to work well for him.\" Whether friendliness and Hickenlooper's oddball nature set the right tone for this historic moment is one of the things voters grapple with as they feel the weight of potentially deciding control of the Senate. Katherine Newell is a 31-year-old unaffiliated voter who used to be a registered Democrat. She said she left the party \"because it's not really living up to its ideals.\" She plans to vote in the primary, which allows unaffiliated voters to participate. \"We have an opportunity right now to shift the paradigm in Washington; we are evolving so rapidly as a state,\" she said. \"I'm really loving many of the changes that we've been able to make in the past couple of years, which is why I have been so shocked at, oh gosh, the male, pale and stale choices we now have in the Senate primary.\" Newell's position is something that speaks to the tensions the Democratic Party faced in the recent presidential primary race that ended with former Vice President Joe Biden as the presumptive nominee. It could also be a warning that needs to be heeded if Democrats hope to galvanize enough support to take control of the Senate. \"I think as a millennial, a lot of people my age feel very similarly,\" Newell said. She hasn't decided whom she'll vote for yet but added, \"If you're no one's first choice, if we're all settling for you, why are you even going to Washington?\"",

Cheri Bustos, who is running the House Democrats' 2020 campaign operation, tell NPR: \"There couldn't be a clearer differentiation between what we are fighting for and what they are fighting against.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, who is running the House Democrats' 2020 campaign operation, tell NPR: \"There couldn't be a clearer differentiation between what we are fighting for and what they are fighting against.\" A coalition of Democratic committees representing governors, attorneys general, senators and members of Congress released a strategy memo Tuesday outlining that their collective strategy for the 2020 elections is to focus on health care. \"Democrats are betting that Americans will vote for the party of health care over the party of drinking bleach,\" Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., told NPR in an interview, referring to President Trump's suggestion in April that doctors look into injecting disinfectants into COVID-19 patients. Bustos is running the House Democrats' campaign operation this year. \"The COVID-19 epidemic underscores the urgency of our efforts to protect Americans' access to affordable health care,\" the memo states. It is co-authored by Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez; Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev.; Democratic Governors Association Chair Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J.; Democratic Attorneys General Association Co-Chairs Maura Healey and Ellen Rosenblum; and Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee Chair Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who is the majority leader of the New York Senate. The issue has historically been a winner for the Democratic Party \u2014 most recently in the 2018 midterms that delivered a House majority \u2014 so the continued focus is no political surprise, particularly as the Trump administration continues its legal effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Read the full memo here. \"Republicans at all levels own this lawsuit's attacks on Americans' health care and they will be held responsible for their party-wide obsession with throwing our health care system into chaos and stripping health care from 20 million Americans during a global pandemic,\" the memo states. The Supreme Court is expecting to hear the ACA challenge this fall. Democrats' internal polling, as well as public polling, regularly lists health care as a top issue for voters. Bustos said that includes congressional districts won by Donald Trump in 2016. On the congressional level, Democrats intend to campaign against Republicans who voted in favor of repealing the ACA. On the gubernatorial and state legislative level, Democrats say they will focus on GOP opposition to Medicaid expansion. Bustos says Democrats will campaign in favor of making health care more accessible and affordable and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. \"There couldn't be a clearer differentiation between what we are fighting for and what they are fighting against,\" she said. The memo sidesteps the more divisive debate inside the Democratic Party over what the future of health care should look like \u2014 a debate that defined the Democratic presidential contest. On one end was the progressive wing led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., arguing for a government-run \"Medicare for All\" system, and on the other the centrist wing led by former Vice President and presumptive nominee Joe Biden to protect and expand the ACA. Bustos said that debate will continue but noted that defending the health care law delivered victory in 2018. \"We all come from different camps. We all come from different parts of the country,\" she said. \"But we know that we have been successful \u2014 again, flipping 40 seats in 2018 \u2014 by talking about expanding the Affordable Care Act and making sure we're fighting for people with preexisting conditions.\" Democrats are also expected to highlight some of the president's more provocative statements during the pandemic in their campaigns. \"They are led by President Trump who just this week talked about taking hydroxychloroquine when the medical evidence is clear that that is not what a person should be doing right now ... and he's advocating for that and bragging about that,\" she said. \"That's the leader of their party, who talked about injecting bleach or Lysol. That is the leader of their party, and that's how they talk about health care.\" Trump later said his comments about using disinfectant to kill the virus were sarcastic. While Republicans broadly support repealing the ACA, the party has never coalesced around an alternative policy to cover the uninsured. Health care remains a priority for the president, who has promised to offer a \"phenomenal\" health plan during his reelection campaign that will remake the GOP as \"the party of health care.\" It has not been released yet.",

Kamala Harris (left) and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are two potential running mates for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, a former vice president himself. Updated on June 11 at 9:30 p.m. ET Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has vowed he will pick a woman to be his vice presidential running mate. But which woman? He's facing pressure to pick a black woman, but during the primary he also had relative deficiencies with Latino voters. He has to consider the progressive left, given that he was not progressives' preferred candidate and some of them didn't turn out for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election. But he doesn't want to alienate the middle, either, as he looks to win over the narrow slice of persuadable voters in the country. Media no longer available Credit:  NPR It's not an easy choice. Biden, a former vice president, has said he wants someone with whom he's \"simpatico.\" Chemistry is vitally important in a vice president. She needs to be someone Biden can trust to have his back in hard times, and she needs to be someone with whom a potential President Biden can govern. But there's more to it this year. The vice presidential selection process is usually fun to talk about. It even gets a cutesy nickname, the \"Veepstakes.\" But the VP pick rarely matters, in terms of actually affecting the outcome of a presidential election. This year might be different, though. Given Biden's age, this pick is perhaps the most consequential in decades. Biden will be 78 by the time he would be sworn in. That would make him the oldest president ever to assume the office. So his VP pick needs to be ready on Day 1 to be president. And she, of course, has to fulfill that first rule of picking a running mate: First, do no harm. Here, in alphabetical order, are some pros and cons of 11 of the people Biden might pick: Stacey Abrams Former Georgia House Democratic Leader Stacey Abrams speaks at the National Press Club in Washington in 2019.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael A. McCoy/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Georgia House Democratic Leader Stacey Abrams speaks at the National Press Club in Washington in 2019. Pros: The former Georgia gubernatorial candidate fires up progressives. For them, her close loss there in 2018 symbolizes what happens when the vote, especially of minorities, is suppressed. She's African American, outspoken and unafraid to make the case. The argument for Abrams goes that if the country is as polarized as it seems, and Clinton struggled to get out the base at the margins, Abrams might be able to help. Cons: But Abrams also presents potential risk. She's not currently an elected official, and she hasn't been vetted on a national stage. Things like her having owed more than $50,000 in back taxes are sure to come up. She had the opportunity to run for president \u2014 and for one of two open Senate seats in Georgia this cycle \u2014 and she passed. She's also rankled some with what looks like open lobbying for the job. She denies that she is, but she told The Atlantic, \"I would put my capacity to win an election as the VP running mate alongside anyone's.\" That irritated some in the old guard, including Rep. William Clay of Missouri, who called her lobbying offensive. \"You can't show up at the winner's window with loser's tickets and demand anything,\" he said. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin walks in Capitol Hill in January.\n                \n                    \n                    Jose Luis Magana/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin walks in Capitol Hill in January. Pros: Perhaps no state is more important in 2020 than Wisconsin. Democrats lost it narrowly in 2016, and it's the most conservative of the three former Blue Wall states Clinton lost, including Michigan and Pennsylvania. Baldwin has a lot of firsts to her name: She's the first woman elected to the House and also the Senate from Wisconsin; and she's the first openly gay person elected to the Senate. She also has her own compelling story to tell when it comes to health care, as she had a \"pre-existing condition\" as a child that made it difficult for her family to get her care. So though she, unlike Biden, may prefer Medicare for All, she could make a good case for expanding coverage. Cons: Baldwin isn't well known nationally and, perhaps more importantly, picking her would mean opening up a potentially vulnerable Senate seat after she just won reelection to it in 2018. Her seat would go to a special election in 2021. Imagine if Democrats have a great 2020 Senate run, take over the chamber, only to see it threatened months after taking control. Florida Rep. Val Demings Impeachment managers Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., center, and Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, left, walk to the Senate trial of President Trump in February.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Impeachment managers Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., center, and Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, left, walk to the Senate trial of President Trump in February. Pros: The second-term Florida congresswoman got attention for her role as an impeachment manager in the trial of President Trump, and she gained that role because of her organization and sharp, clear style of arguing. She's disciplined, was Orlando's first female police chief and could have appeal in her crucial battleground state. Even doing better at the margins in Florida could seal the presidency for a Democrat. Cons: While she's known in the I-4 corridor in Florida, it's not the same kind of swing area it used to be; it's trended far more Democratic. And she's not as tested statewide. Additionally, her time as Orlando police chief has rankled some African American leaders, because though Orlando saw a drop in violent crime, the department paid out millions in damages after lawsuits related to false arrest and use of excessive force. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., is seen leaving the Capitol earlier this year.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., is seen leaving the Capitol earlier this year. Pros: The Illinois senator has an incredible story to tell. She's an Army veteran who lost both of her legs when a helicopter she was piloting in Iraq in 2004 was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade. She's the first disabled woman and first person born in Thailand (to a father who was an American citizen) elected to the Senate. And she had a baby at 50, the first senator to give birth in office. So Duckworth is both a woman of color and from the Midwest (though not a battleground state). She also hasn't shied away from taking on Trump. \"I will not be lectured about what our military needs by a five-deferment draft dodger,\" she said in 2018. Cons: She is clearly in the moderate camp. \"I don't think you can go too far to the left and still win the Midwest,\" she said after the 2018 elections. That cuts two ways \u2014 she might appeal to the middle, but likely wouldn't fire up the base. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand Pros: The New York senator has taken a leading role on sexual assault, and she's backed Biden on the 1993 allegation of an assault made by a former staffer. That could help blunt any issues Biden might have on the subject. Cons: But being from New York, there's no geographic diversity she'd bring, she isn't as much of a rock star on the left as, say, Elizabeth Warren, and she doesn't solve the issue of groups calling for Biden to pick a woman of color. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham puts on her face mask in April when not speaking during an update on the COVID-19 outbreak in the state.\n                \n                    \n                    Eddie Moore/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham puts on her face mask in April when not speaking during an update on the COVID-19 outbreak in the state. Pros: The New Mexico governor is the only Latina governor in the country, and a Latina on the presidential ticket would be historic. She has won praise from Democrats for her early action in her handling of the coronavirus pandemic. (Some Republicans say otherwise.) She has taken the fight to sheriffs in her state after passage of a so-called red-flag law that some said they might not enforce, and she took the fight to Trump on immigration. In 2018, as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, she crashed a White House meeting on immigration to tell the president he was making it harder than it needed to be to get to a compromise on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Cons: But she's also not well known nationally and wasn't particularly popular at home before the coronavirus, and she would have to be taken out of her current role in handling the pandemic to be on the ticket. California Sen. Kamala Harris Pros: The California senator is thought to have an inside track for a host of reasons. She ran for president, which means she's been vetted on the national stage; she's black, which would satisfy those who are urging Biden to pick a black woman; and there's a personal connection \u2014 she was close with Biden's son Beau. The former prosecutor and state attorney general has a reputation as an incisive questioner and being able to make a clear argument. Envisioning her holding her own in a debate with Vice President Pence is not difficult. Cons: She was criticized for a lack of a coherent message during her presidential run, but Biden's message would become hers. She doesn't necessarily fire up the progressive left, which doesn't love some of her past positions on criminal justice; she doesn't give any regional advantage \u2014 a ticket with an East Coast former senator and a senator from California doesn't exactly dispel the notion of Democrats not caring about the middle of the country; and it's not clear Harris has appeal to the middle of the electorate in places like the Upper Midwest. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar endorses Biden after ending her own presidential bid, on March 2.\n                \n                    \n                    Ron Jenkins/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar endorses Biden after ending her own presidential bid, on March 2. Pros: The Minnesota senator saw some late momentum in the Democratic primary before dropping out to consolidate support behind Biden. She impressed during the campaign with her quick wit on debate stages and on the campaign trail. She tries for cross-party Midwestern appeal, touting that she won reelection in 2018 by more than 20 points in a state Trump lost by only two points in 2016. Cons: While Klobuchar has potential appeal in the Midwest, her more moderate views and approach do little to excite the base. She also had little strength during the primary with black and Latino voters, who are key parts of the Democratic Party. Susan Rice Pros: The Obama-era national security adviser and former United Nations ambassador is among the top Democratic foreign-policy experts in the country. She's African American and is someone Biden is comfortable with, given they served together in the Obama administration and foreign policy is a pet issue for both. Cons: But she's never stood for elective office, making her readiness to be president a question mark, despite her foreign-policy credentials. What's more, her role in the Benghazi affair threatens to be a distraction off the bat, something someone at the top of the ticket can barely afford in their VP pick. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren Sen. Elizabeth Warren waves to supporters and volunteers during her presidential run in February.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Rourke/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Elizabeth Warren waves to supporters and volunteers during her presidential run in February. Pros: Democrats and the progressive left love Warren. She tops polls for who Democrats want Biden to pick. She knows the issues as well or better than anyone and would certainly be ready to govern. A Warren pick would indicate Biden wants to embrace the left and some of Warren's (and Bernie Sanders') policies and political approaches. Warren would not be someone who sits back as vice president \u2014 she'd want a portfolio and to work on the things important to her right away. Cons: But Warren and Biden haven't always had a warm relationship (though she's said nice things about him lately). And she does nothing to appeal to the middle, has no regional advantage and isn't a woman of color. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Pros: The Michigan governor has been thrust onto the national scene \u2014 and into controversy \u2014 with her stay-at-home rules during the pandemic. Biden's team would hope that Whitmer could appeal in the must-win Upper Midwest. If the verdict on Whitmer is that she handled the coronavirus crisis with competence, her stock would rise. Among Democrats, crisis management experience was the most desired quality in a Biden VP, according to a recent poll. Cons: But the controversy doesn't necessarily help Whitmer's chances. Michigan has seen some of the most fervent protests, with armed men taking to the state capitol, and Trump has tweeted \"Liberate Michigan.\" If she's seen as divisive and polarizing, that could hurt her chances of being selected. What's more, it's difficult to pluck a governor who is dealing with a crisis out of that post. And Whitmer might be seen as too green \u2014 she hasn't really been tested as a surrogate for Biden on a national stage. Editor's note: This post originally included Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, but she has since withdrawn her name from consideration, saying she supports Biden but wants to focus on her state's economic recovery.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, seen here speaking at a campaign event for Bernie Sanders in March, has been named co-chair of a climate change task force to support party unity. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his chief primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., announced on Wednesday the members of a joint task force meant to unify the party ahead of November's general election, bringing together figures from different wings of the party, ranging from New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to former Secretary of State John Kerry. The news comes a month after Sanders joined Biden via video stream to endorse him. The pair pledged to create these task forces to focus on shared policy concerns. \"Now, it's no great secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences, and we're not going to paper them over; that's real,\" Sanders said at the time. \"But I hope that these task forces will come together utilizing the best minds and people in your campaign and in my campaign to work out real solutions to these very, very important problems.\" Sanders and Biden had clashed on the campaign trail over issues including health care and Social Security. The task forces bring together prominent surrogates from both camps in an effort to shore up support from progressives who supported Sanders in the primary but are wary of the more centrist Biden. Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent surrogate of Sanders, will co-chair the climate change group alongside Kerry, a longtime Biden supporter. There are five other task forces tackling criminal justice reform, the economy, education, health care and immigration. The first-year progressive congresswoman has said she would vote for Biden but explained to NPR's Morning Edition last week why she hasn't fully endorsed him yet. \"I think an endorsement means, you know, we have come to a place where we've developed a vision together not just for winning in November, but for getting our country to a better place,\" she said. When Sanders, an independent who identifies as a democratic socialist, was leading the primary race, Republicans had hoped to label the Democrats broadly as a socialist party. The policy work with Sanders and allies like Ocasio-Cortez are reviving those efforts, with a GOP response to the news calling Biden \"the bannerman for the socialist agenda.\" House Progressive Caucus co-chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., will co-chair the health care group alongside Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general during the Obama administration. Jayapal campaigned for Sanders in early primary states and supports \"Medicare for All.\" The health care task force also includes Dr. Donald Berwick, who served as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama. The immigration group is headed by Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., and Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which backed Sanders' immigration policies during the primary. Leading the economy task force is Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, and Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif. Bass is the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus and endorsed Biden in early March. Nelson had joined Sanders for a virtual campaign event in March to discuss how the coronavirus pandemic was affecting her union members. Chiraag Bains and Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., will lead the criminal justice reform group. Another prominent member of the criminal justice task force is former Attorney General Eric Holder, who served in the Obama administration. Heather Gautney and Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio., will co-chair the education group. Fudge serves on the House Committee on Education and Labor and is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Gautney was a senior policy adviser to Sanders' presidential campaign. In a statement, Biden underscored the need to unify the party: \"From health care to reforming our justice system to rebuilding a more inclusive and fair economy, the work of the task forces will be essential to identifying ways to build on our progress and not simply turn the clock back to a time before Donald Trump, but transform our country.\" In the same statement, Sanders echoed his sentiments during the campaign, urging the party to think \"big, act boldly and fight to change the direction of our country.\" \"I commend Joe Biden for working together with my campaign to assemble a group of leading thinkers and activists who can and will unify our party in a transformational and progressive direction,\" Sanders said.",

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, seen campaigning with former Vice President Joe Biden in March, are two of the women often talked about as possible running mates on the Democratic ticket. Former Vice President Joe Biden formally began the process of selecting a running mate on Thursday morning, releasing the names of former and current Democratic officials who will lead his search for a vice presidential candidate, who Biden has said will be a woman. Former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, Delaware Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Cynthia C. Hogan, a top aide to Biden in the Senate and White House, will lead the search over the coming months. \"Selecting a vice presidential candidate is one of the most important decisions in a presidential campaign and no one knows this more than Joe Biden,\" campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. \"These four co-chairs reflect the strength and diversity of our party, and will provide tremendous insight and expertise to what will be a rigorous selection and vetting process. We are grateful for their service to the campaign and for their leadership.\" The team will also include what's described as \"a network of vetting teams\" working under former Obama White House counsel Bob Bauer, Biden campaign general counsel Dana Remus and former Obama homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco. Biden's pledge to pick a woman as his running mate intensified speculation since his path to the Democratic nomination became clear. Several potential candidates have addressed the prospect in interviews in recent weeks. Biden said he would consider California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate just one day after she ended her own bid for president late last year. A Biden-Harris ticket has the potential to increase turnout and support among black voters. While Biden praised Harris' efforts after she dropped out in December and she has campaigned on his behalf, the two famously sparred in the first Democratic primary debate when Harris criticized Biden's past stance on school busing, an issue that had affected Harris personally. When asked in an interview on April 16 whether she would accept an offer to be Biden's running mate, Harris stressed that her focus is on fighting COVID-19 while adding, \"Obviously, I'd be honored to serve with Joe.\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has also been floated and would be one of the most progressive choices for Biden. Biden and Warren have not seen eye to eye on a number of issues \u2014 notably clashing on bankruptcy policy 15 years ago, though Biden has since endorsed Warren's bankruptcy reform plan. Warren is also a supporter of \"Medicare for All,\" a key progressive policy priority that Biden does not support. As a running mate, Warren has the potential to bring in more liberal voters who may be wary of Biden's record as a centrist. On April 15, Warren said on MSNBC that she would accept the offer to be Biden's running mate. When asked in another interview on the network about the prospects of an all-white ticket, Warren responded, \"That is a decision that will be up to the vice president.\" Former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams is another possible contender. Abrams is seen as someone who could boost voter turnout among black voters and progressives, especially considering black voters in Georgia turned out at a higher rate for her 2018 campaign than in the 2016 general election. Abrams has focused on addressing voter suppression through her organization Fair Fight Action since her campaign ended. One of Abrams' biggest potential drawbacks is that she does not have any federal experience. Abrams has been the most vocal about her interest in being Biden's running mate over the past weeks. \"I would be an excellent running mate,\" Abrams first said in an interview with Elle magazine published earlier this month. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has become one of the most frequently mentioned picks because of her rising profile governing a state at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic. In her 2018 race, Whitmer won in nine counties that voted for President Trump in 2016. As Biden faces an allegation of sexual assault, which his campaign denies, Whitmer has been open about her own experience as a sexual assault survivor. In an interview with NPR on April 14, Whitmer chose not to voice her outright opinion on the accusation by a former Biden Senate staffer named Tara Reade. \"It is something that no one takes lightly,\" she said. Other possible running mates, including Abrams and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also ran for president this year, have been asked about the allegation and voiced support for Biden. When asked about the prospect of being Biden's running mate, Whitmer told NPR that she's focusing on her current role, but leaving the door open. \"It's absolutely flattering to be considered among a massive group of women leaders across the nation,\" she said. Conversations about representation in the Democratic Party have become more frequent in recent years and many in the party have explicitly called on Biden to choose a woman of color for the ticket. One of Biden's search committee co-chairs, Rochester, was the first person of color and first woman ever elected to Congress from Biden's home state of Delaware. Several other Democrats have been rumored as potential picks for Biden, including Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Florida Rep. Val Demings, all women of color.",

Both women dropped out of the race in early March. Elizabeth Warren has now fully thrown her support behind former Vice President Joe Biden in the presidential race. She has even said, without question, that she would serve as his vice president. It has been a little over a month since Warren dropped out of the race. At the time, only Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, two older white men, were left as the viable candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, highlighting that the Democratic Party would not diversify the top of the ticket this year. The party had had its most diverse set of candidates of all time this cycle, including the largest group of women ever. That six-woman wave of candidates came after four years of buildup \u2013 years that featured Democratic women getting mad, getting organized, getting on the ballot and getting elected in record numbers in 2018. And Democrats sure seemed excited about women in the abstract: As of November, 83% of Democrats said they were \"enthusiastic\" about voting for a woman. Only 53% said they were \"enthusiastic\" about white men. But then, it was never assured, or even widely assumed, that a woman would win the nomination. Biden and Sanders went into the race with high name recognition among Democrats and with significant bases of support, whether among party activists or the establishment. May the best woman win.\ud83d\udcf7: Annie Leibovitzhttps://t.co/W7HX906nO1 pic.twitter.com/7ZgRwNd40P And as it turned out, the race came down to those two white men. So ... what happened? Gender was definitely a factor in this year's Democratic primaries. How could it not be after what the party has seen over the past four years? But the ways in which attitudes about gender impacted the outcome are varied and, of course, more than a bit complicated. What we know: Democrats' electability \"freakout\" When Warren bowed out, she was explicit in calling out sexism. \"If you say, 'Yeah, there was sexism in this race,' everyone says, 'Whiner!' \" Warren said. \"If you say, 'No, there was no sexism,' about a bazillion women think, 'What planet do you live on?' \" I've spent more than a year asking voters about gender and sexism in this presidential race, and I can say with confidence that Democratic voters who don't want to vote for a woman (or, at least, who will say such a thing out loud) are rare to nonexistent. In a January Ipsos/USA Today poll, 84% of people who planned to vote in Democratic primaries said they agreed with the statement that they would be \"comfortable with a woman president.\" But that leaves 1 in 6 potential voters in another category. That group includes the 5% who said they disagreed. Perhaps 5% is a sliver, but especially in tight primaries, it is meaningful if 1 in 20 voters are biased against the female candidates. (Furthermore, there is the question of what the other 11% of voters meant when they said they \"neither agree nor disagree.\") And then there's this: Only 33% of likely voters of any party said they thought their neighbors would be comfortable with a female president.

Elizabeth Warren for the annual Village Halloween parade in 2019 in New York City. This is something that many journalists (myself included) heard over and over in interviews with voters \u2013 not sexism itself driving voters' choices, but fears about other people's sexism. \"I have a friend at work \u2014 she's like, 'You're not progressive.' She thinks that I don't want a woman president,\" Anita Burgess told NPR in March 2019. \"I do! But I don't think they're going to do it! And so I can't waste my vote either, because we have to get the orange man out. I'm sorry \u2014 orange man got to go,\" she said, mocking President Trump's appearance. And that feeling persisted in the Democratic electorate through the primaries. \"I really like Elizabeth Warren, but I just don't think a woman is going to win this election, unfortunately,\" UCLA student Brook Rosenberg told NPR as she stood in line to vote in California's primary. \"Also, I don't want Trump to tear her down.\" Polling showed how widespread this fear was. In that January poll, 50% of people who planned to vote in the Democratic primaries said they agreed that a woman would have a tougher time running against Trump than a man. Half as many \u2014 24% \u2014 disagreed. It's important to keep in mind that while a wide field of female candidates is a relatively new phenomenon, this kind of amateur political strategizing is nothing new. \"The Democrats always freak out about electability,\" former presidential contender and Democratic Rep. Pat Schroeder told me (with a heavy sigh) in December. \"I mean, I remember every single primary, everybody starts, [gasp] 'Who are we going to get?'\" \"Of course,\" she added, \"this year, we're having a bigger freakout than normal just because people are so obsessed about, 'How do we get rid of Trump?'\" It's not just that Democrats desperately want to unseat Trump, though. For some voters, the very fact not just that a woman lost in 2016, but that this man won \u2013 someone with a track record of insulting and objectifying women, who also has a long list of sexual misconduct claims against him (all of which he denies) \u2013 is a sign of how much sexism their fellow voters are willing to put up with. \"I don't think it's right, but I think that the fact that we have the person in the White House that we do, it is evidence that the country is not quite totally ready for a woman,\" New Hampshire voter Patti Rutka told me in March 2019. Or as Mother Jones' Pema Levy more pithily opined, \"Trump's greatest trick was convincing voters women can't win elections.\" And so, as Democratic organizer Karine Jean-Pierre explains it, voters thought about who seemed like they could be president. \"They're thinking, 'We have to beat Donald Trump. What's the best way to do it?'\" she said. \"OK. Maybe someone who is of his age, someone who has been the closest to being presidential, if you think about being a vice president, being the No. 2 to the president being in the Oval Office, having all of those visuals.\" At the 2019 Iowa State Fair, a woman takes a selfie near Sen.

Early in his campaign, multiple women accused him of invading their personal space. He eventually apologized ... around the same time that he joked about the matter onstage at a campaign event. In addition, some news outlets have reported more recently about a more serious allegation against the former vice president. Biden also reported early in 2019 that he had apologized to Anita Hill for her treatment when she accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in his Senate confirmation hearings. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, Biden chaired those hearings. Hill told The New York Times that she didn't feel Biden had apologized to her for his own role in her treatment. \"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, 'I'm sorry for what happened to you,' \" she said. \"I will be satisfied when I know that there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.\" The \"hostile sexism\" factor Here's one more thing we know: that higher levels of sexism were associated with a greater likelihood of supporting Biden and Sanders, as well as a lower likelihood of supporting Warren. Political scientist Brian Schaffner attempted to measure sexism by having pollsters ask Democrats if they agreed with phrases including \"women are too easily offended\" and \"most women fail to appreciate fully all that men do for them.\" In a separate interview, pollsters asked those same people whom they preferred in the primary.

But her support dropped off very quickly among those who registered higher levels of sexism.\" Schaffner found something similar in the 2016 general election \u2013 that there was an association between sexism, as he defined it, as well as racism \u2013 and voting for Trump. But he says that these associations mean something different in a Democratic primary. \"In a primary election, you take party out of the equation,\" he said. \"You have a bunch of candidates who have very similar positions who are running against each other. And people tend to rely on what they can, that differentiates these candidates who otherwise look fairly similar to them. And gender is definitely one of those things.\" Furthermore, while Schaffner found this correlation \u2013 and, to be clear, attempted to control for a range of factors, like ideology \u2013 his study doesn't mean that a bunch of voters walked into the voting booth with straightforwardly sexist ideas driving their votes. He recognizes that the relationship is subtler. \"I think a lot of this plays at a subconscious level for voters,\" he said. \"They may not be really aware that the things that they think grate on them about Warren are actually things that wouldn't bother them if it was a man doing the same things.\" The presidency may be different But then, hold on. We do know that female candidates often do just fine at winning races \u2014 in fact, studies show that female congressional candidates win at roughly the same rates as men do. (\"When women run, they win\" is a common refrain among groups that work to elect more women.) One possibility, as Democratic pollster Celinda Lake told NPR last year, is that voters treat the presidency different from other offices. \"Voters are very, very willing to send women, younger candidates, people of color, LGBTQ candidates to Congress,\" she said. \"But for president or executive office in general, we know from the data that people are much, much more cautious and tend to second-guess themselves much more.\" In addition, there's evidence that women face a \"performance premium\" in running for office \u2014 that, yes, they may win at similar rates to men at the congressional level, but that they have to be better candidates to do it. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said something to this effect at the November debate, contrasting the female candidates to the then-37-year-old South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg: \"Do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don't. Maybe we're held to a different standard.\" Minnesota Sen.

Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg participate in the November Democratic primary debate in Atlanta. Of course, it's impossible to know on an individual basis whether any particular candidate is more successful because they're a man (or less so because they're a woman). But there was another memorable debate line, this one from Warren, that threw this into relief. At a January debate, Warren noted that she and Klobuchar were the only two candidates onstage who had never lost a race. In addition, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and California Sen. Kamala Harris had never lost an election until this year's primaries, either. It is, of course, possible to become president with a loss or two on one's record. But this cycle, America only saw competitive female candidates with long resumes and perfect down-ballot records. Unanswered questions Knowing exactly how much gender played into voters' decisions this year may never be possible because it's so deeply mixed into how people think. \"We know that what's really happening in most cases is gender is informing a lot of the different aspects or predictors of a candidate's success,\" says Kelly Dittmar, professor at Rutgers University's Center on American Women and Politics. \"And so to try to pinpoint how much sexism mattered becomes much more difficult. Instead, I try to think about it as, 'What are the ways in which gender shapes the dynamics of the race?' \" Dittmar uses Kamala Harris as an example: When she dropped out, the California senator said one reason was that she didn't have enough money to carry on. \"Was that solely because she was a woman or because she was a black woman? No. There were other challenges at play, in terms of the strength of support for her candidacy,\" Dittmar said. \"But were gender and race and the interaction of those things probably a factor in how much she was able to gain support, interaction with donors? That's very likely.\" Jean-Pierre also evidence of a higher standard in Harris' rise and fall. \"She started off with 20,000 people at her at her rally in Oakland. She raised tons of money very early on, and she never made it to Iowa. She never made it to certain early states,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"I do believe that there is just a different way that women are treated. There is a different way that women of color are treated. And there are these barriers that are so much higher that they have to jump over and cross.\" Of course, no candidate lost purely because of their identity (just as Biden didn't win purely because of his). Voters raised substantive questions of all of the female candidates in this race: Harris' record as a prosecutor angered some progressives. Klobuchar was too moderate for some progressives, and she also faced allegations that she was abusive to her staff. Gillibrand has swung from moderate positions to progressive ones during her career. Warren's early answers on how she would pay for \"Medicare for All\" struck some as evasive. But it's possible that women were punished more for these things than men would have been. \"I think it's compatible to think both that it was sexist and that there's really some substance to those criticisms,\" says Kate Manne, Cornell University philosophy professor and author of Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny. \"And here, it's not that the criticism is illegitimate because it's sexist. It's that we're soft-pedaling the criticism, albeit unwittingly, when it comes to a male counterpart who's done something very, very similar.\" The comparison between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on paying for Medicare for All is an excellent example of just how difficult it is to tell what was driving voter attitudes and expectations. Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the unveiling of Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" legislation on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., in September 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    AFP Contributor/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the unveiling of Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" legislation on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., in September 2017. On the one hand, Sanders put forth a list of funding options, but never came out with an exact way to pay for his own Medicare for All plan. Warren, meanwhile, faced heavy scrutiny over how she would pay for his plan, which she backed. To Manne, that is plainly unfair. \"Reasonable minds can disagree about whether her plan for implementing Medicare for All was a good plan,\" she said. \"[But] it's kind of remarkable that she got lambasted for the content of her plan while his non-plan played much better.\" Then again, Warren had made \"having a plan for that\" her brand. So one could also argue that she naturally had additional expectations here. But on top of that, there's another potential layer: Was Warren forced to run as the hypercompetent, plan-for-everything candidate because she's a woman? Or, put another way: Could a woman candidate run as a revolutionary, the way Sanders did, and get as far as he did? Gender still matters The presidential race will be one white, straight man versus another white, straight man. But that doesn't mean gender, as well as other parts of a candidate's identity, is no longer a factor, Dittmar points out. \"The more that you see candidates move away from simply masculinity as the sort of measure by which presidentiality is determined or valued, we see that then leads to hopefully some progress in which women don't have a distinct set of challenges,\" she said. She points to a 2006 memo strategist Mark Penn wrote for Hillary Clinton's first presidential run, in which he warned her against being seen as too soft and nurturing: \"[Voters] do not want someone who would be the first mama... But there is a yearning for a kind of tough single parent.\" These conversations have largely centered on the Democratic Party, which has had more \u2014 and more successful \u2014 female presidential candidates than Republicans have. And when Republicans do have another opportunity to nominate a woman, those women might run differently than Democratic women. That's because Democratic voters tend to be more receptive than Republican voters to identity-based campaigning. In 2018, and again in the 2020 Democratic presidential field, women ran more firmly as women, with more overtly feminist messages tailored to speak to women's experiences. Warren's story of struggling to find child care as a law student was a standby on the stump. Similarly, Klobuchar told voters the story of being kicked out of the hospital 24 hours after giving birth. However, Republican strategist Alice Stewart, who has worked on multiple presidential campaigns, including Michele Bachmann's in 2012, says that it's nevertheless telling that her party has yet to nominate a woman. \"I truly believe Republicans will say gender doesn't matter: 'I would vote for the person based on their qualifications, whereas others might say gender is a factor.' But they evidently are not following through with that,\" she said. Even though a woman will not win the presidency this year, the 2020 field represented progress, with a diverse range of female candidates finding a range of ways to be themselves on the trail. And progress could still come from the men in the race, Dittmar adds. \"I think it's just important to remember that the gender dynamics of the race are still very much at play,\" she said. \"And so in terms of the value we place on masculinity, it's something for us all to be continually evaluating with the men who are left. How do they navigate gender?\" The question is doubly relevant considering that Biden's opponent is someone who weaponizes masculinity in his campaigning. Biden has done so himself on occasion \u2013 \"If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him,\" he said of Trump in 2018. Female candidates also aren't out of this campaign yet: Biden has promised to put a woman on the ticket with him. Were Biden to win the presidency, that woman would be the highest-ranking female elected official in American history. It would be progress. Just slower than some Democrats would have hoped.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination Joe Biden on Monday, as they work to unify Democrats against President Trump in the 2020 election.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Bernie Sanders dropped out of the presidential race last week. And today he made his support for his former rival Joe Biden clear. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: So today I am asking all Americans - I'm asking every Democrat; I'm asking every independent; I'm asking a lot of Republicans - to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse. KELLY: All right, so what is next as Sanders and Biden try to unify their supporters? For more on that, we're going to bring in NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi there. KELLY: So Bernie Sanders has said for a while that he would support Biden if he became the nominee. Speak to the significance of actually hearing him say it out loud today. KHALID: Well, you're right. He has long said he would support whoever was the Democratic nominee. But to me, the timing and the tone were key. I mean, this is very early for a rival to make an endorsement. You can think back to 2016. Sanders then did not endorse Hillary Clinton until July. If you look back even at 2008, Hillary Clinton did not endorse Barack Obama until the end of June. So, I mean, I would say that this is very early, historically speaking. Today, to me, though, the tone between these two men was also important to watch. They joined each other via livestream, and, you know, there were so many moments where you could hear Sanders seem to try to remind his supporters about the need to defeat Donald Trump as president. And then you also heard from Joe Biden, you know, some indications that these two men are friends. He explicitly thanked Sanders for his friendship, told him he was not going to try to, you know, let him down and that he would need his support not just to campaign but to also govern. And you got the sense that these were two men who genuinely saw each other as friends and believed that they need to unite in order to defeat the Republicans. KELLY: So that all sounds very pleasant, very friendly. However, these two politicians have not been competing against each other for months for lack of differences - all kind of... KHALID: Yup. KELLY: ...Policy differences. Did they try to begin reconciling any of those today? KHALID: Well, today in this livestream video that they did, they - you know, you definitely heard Joe Biden, in particular, emphasize these sort of shared goals, common values. Here he is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: You and I have always shared a profound conviction as long as we've both been in politics. This country wasn't built by Wall Street. It wasn't built by CEOs and hedge fund managers. It was built by workers. KHALID: Now, Mary Louise, that language sounds, probably, awfully familiar to the type of language we've heard from Bernie Sanders for a while. We heard these two men - to me, what was most interesting - talk about the sense that they are planning to unite and actually create task forces to focus on specific policy priorities - education, the economy, climate change. But, you know, there is a big distinction on health care between these two men. And I will say I spent a lot of time talking to progressive activists in the last few days, and they've said if there's not really movement on \"Medicare for All\" from Joe Biden, they don't know that all of Sanders' supporters will really come around to him. KELLY: OK. We did get more primary results today. Joe Biden is projected to win last week's Wisconsin primary, but Sanders says he is going to stay on the ballot for the rest of this primary season. So what does that mean as the campaign moves ahead? KHALID: Well, he's trying to accrue more delegates with the primary goal of influencing the DNC's platform and rules. But, to me, the other unknown factor as we move ahead is what it will really take to convince some of his supporters to back Joe Biden. You know, we have seen - and we saw it even again today despite this livestream video that they did to get together that there are Biden skeptics within the Democratic Party. And, ultimately, there will still be more work for both of these men to do to convince those folks to come around and vote for Biden in November. KELLY: NPR's Asma Khalid - thank you, Asma.

His bid this week to allow 60-year-olds to get Medicare \"reflects the reality,\" he says, \"that, even after the current crisis ends, older Americans are likely to find it difficult to secure jobs.\" In one of his first proposals since becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden is wading back into the roiling waters of health policy. In a nod to the effects of COVID-19 on the economy, and in what is clearly an overture to supporters of the \"Medicare for All\" plan pushed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Biden wants to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 60. \"It reflects the reality that, even after the current crisis ends, older Americans are likely to find it difficult to secure jobs,\" the former vice president wrote this week in a post on the website Medium. Details on the plan are few, but Biden made clear that Americans aged 60 to 64 who have employer health coverage could keep it if they wanted to, or could join Medicare. Biden writes: \"Under this concept, Americans would have access, if they choose, to Medicare when they turn 60, instead of when they turn 65. Medicare benefits would be provided to them as they are to current Medicare recipients. This would make Medicare available to a set of Americans who work hard and retire before they turn 65, or who would prefer to leave their employer plans, the public option, or other plans they access through the Affordable Care Act before they retire.\" In addition, he says, \"the Biden Medicare-like public option \u2014 as well as other subsidized private plans available to individuals through the Affordable Care Act \u2014 would remain available.\" Some people think Biden's new proposal doesn't go far enough. RoseAnn DeMoro, former head of the National Nurses United union and a longtime Medicare for All supporter tweeted: \"Now if he will only erase the 60, we have #Medicareforall.\" The Physicians for a National Health Program, which also favors a Medicare for All plan agreed: \"Why the unnecessary 6?\" implying that Biden should lower the eligibility age to 0. But just as Biden's earlier \"public option\" health proposal from last summer seemed incremental compared with more liberal candidates' plans to uproot the nation's health care system in its entirety, this proposal by the former vice president is also more significant than it seems. Since it was a thousand news cycles ago, let's review what Biden proposed in July. That blueprint would uncap federal subsidies for plans purchased through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, so that no one would be required to pay more than 8.5% of their income toward health insurance premiums. It would also create a comprehensive new \"public option\" health insurance program that anyone could purchase, including those who don't like or can't afford what their employer offers. At first glance, Biden's latest plan (which was coupled with a student loan forgiveness plan aimed at younger voters) seems much like many other proposals that surfaced during the Democratic presidential campaign to let people younger than 65 avail themselves of  the popular Medicare program by \"buying in\" to it or a similar program. But this is not at all the same thing. Even though it would be optional, \"it literally means you're in Medicare at 60,\" says Rodney Whitlock, a health care consultant and former GOP congressional aide. Such a plan would also be far simpler to implement. Most of the previous proposals call for people not to enroll in Medicare itself, but rather a parallel, Medicare-like plan run by the federal government. \"The proposals in Congress are totally different,\" says Tricia Neuman, who heads the Medicare policy program for the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"This is so much easier,\" Neuman says. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of KFF.) Easier to implement, maybe, but Biden's latest proposal is also likely to be more controversial. While the few available details pledge that federal funding would come from regular tax revenues rather than from the dwindling Medicare trust fund, Republicans are still likely to oppose such a plan \u2015 strenuously. \"Republicans are all about long-term [Medicare] solvency,\" Whitlock says. In fact, in recent years, Republicans have pushed to raise the eligibility age to 67, to match the new Social Security threshold being phased in. When analysts first started looking at the impact of changing Medicare's eligibility age, they thought that lowering it would help both the Medicare and private insurance risk pools. That's because the 60- to 64-year-olds would become the youngest, and likely healthiest, members of the Medicare pool. Conversely, they are currently the oldest, and presumably sickest, members of the pool for individual market insurance. But that view has changed over the past few years. A 2019 study by the Rand Corp evaluated the consequences of allowing even younger Americans to buy into Medicare. The Rand study found that while people ages 50 to 64 would themselves likely pay less under a buy-in program, that doesn't necessarily translate to savings for the pool of people who buy their own coverage on the individual market. \"When older adults leave the market, insurers are left with a smaller pool of younger, less healthy, and relatively expensive people (given their age), leading to higher premiums,\" the study found. Still, Whitlock says, Biden's latest proposal could disrupt GOP efforts to oppose Medicare for All. Right now, he says, the crux of their argument is that expanding Medicare to everyone would threaten the viability of the popular program for those who are now enrolled in it. But \"only doing it for a targeted group will complicate Republicans' message,\" he says.

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign Wednesday. Though the 78-year-old did not emerge as the Democratic nominee in either of his two presidential bids, his campaigns have reshaped the party's politics and policy in significant ways. Here's a look back at several key moments from the past five years: 1. Sanders Announces His 1st Presidential Bid Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders announces his presidential bid on April 30, 2015, on Capitol Hill in front of media members and a small group of onlookers.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders announces his presidential bid on April 30, 2015, on Capitol Hill in front of media members and a small group of onlookers. The key thing about this moment is that when it happened, it didn't feel key at all. In April 2015, most Democrats saw former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the party's inevitable 2016 nominee. President Obama was urging Vice President Joe Biden not to mount a bid, and many other prominent Democrats, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, decided not to run either. Enter Sanders, who wasn't even a Democrat, and who had spent most of his two-decade career in Washington, D.C., as more of a backbench gadfly than anything else. Sanders had begun to emerge as a national figure several years before, when he protested a bipartisan tax deal with an eight-hour filibuster. Most campaigns launch with a big rally in the candidate's home state. Not this one. Sanders walked outside the Senate, held a 10-minute news conference with a scrum of reporters, and went back to work. The first words of his \"political revolution\"? \"We don't have an endless amount of time. I've got to get back.\" 2. Crowds Start To Grow Sanders supporters cheer at a campaign rally in Portland, Maine, on July 6, 2015. The Vermont senator started drawing big crowds around this time, including an estimated 10,000 people in Madison, Wis.\n                \n                    \n                    Robert F.

The Vermont senator started drawing big crowds around this time, including an estimated 10,000 people in Madison, Wis. But as spring 2015 turned into summer, it became clear that Sanders' anti-establishment, anti-billionaire message was taking off. Crowds grew and grew, including a rally in Madison, Wis., that drew more than 10,000 people. Clinton was not drawing crowds anywhere near that size, even as she maintained wide polling leads over Sanders and often tried to ignore his candidacy. Sanders tapped into a seemingly bottomless pit of small-dollar online donations from supporters, and grew his campaign into a national organization. In early 2016, he shocked the political world by essentially tying Clinton in Iowa, then he blew her out by 22 percentage points in New Hampshire. Four years later, Sanders pinpointed the New Hampshire victory as the moment when his agenda of single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and free public college went from \"too radical, too extreme,\" to something viewed by many voters as a viable, appealing platform. 3. An Uneasy Truce After months of bitter campaigning, Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton in Portsmouth, N.H., on July 12, 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Saglio/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption After months of bitter campaigning, Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton in Portsmouth, N.H., on July 12, 2016. Sanders scored more wins \u2014 most notably in Michigan and Wisconsin that provided (overlooked) warning signs about Clinton's strength in those two key swing states. But over the course of spring 2016, Clinton steadily grew her delegate lead over Sanders, winning key blowout victories in southern states with lots of African-American voters. Sanders refused to drop out, and campaigned through June. Even after Clinton clinched the delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot, Sanders still didn't concede until shortly before the Democratic National Convention. Less than two weeks later, WikiLeaks released a trove of hacked and stolen emails revealing that several Democratic National Committee staffers had a clear preference for Clinton over Sanders. Angry Sanders supporters marched through the streets in Philadelphia, and disrupted the first day of the party's convention. Though Sanders campaigned with and for Clinton into the fall, many Clinton backers blamed Sanders' perceived apathy toward Clinton as a reason why she narrowly lost to Donald Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The Clinton-Sanders rift would never fully heal, and indeed resurfaced several times when he ran again four years later. 4. Democratic Policy Leader Sanders newly unveils his signature \"Medicare for all\" legislation on Sept. 13, 2017. Joining him are three future fellow presidential candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sanders newly unveils his signature \"Medicare for all\" legislation on Sept. 13, 2017. Joining him are three future fellow presidential candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand. Sanders came out of 2016 as a national leader in the party he still hadn't joined. Top Democrats embraced him and sought his validation \u2014 even when it was awkward. Sanders campaigned across the country against President Trump and congressional Republicans' push to repeal Obamacare, and then he reintroduced his signature \"Medicare-for-all\" health care plan. \"Look, I have no illusions that under a Republican Senate and a very right-wing House and an extremely right-wing president of the United States that suddenly we're going to see a Medicare-for-all, single-payer passed,\" Sanders told NPR at the time. \"You're not going to see it. That's obvious.\" But the bill did have a significant impact on the Democratic presidential primary that was still two years away. Future fellow candidates like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New York Sen Kirsten Gillibrand all rushed to cosponsor the legislation. They would all later face a political balancing act of embracing the measure but also, to varying degrees, distancing themselves from two of its core goals: completely eliminating the private health insurance industry, and increasing taxes to pay for coverage. Both Warren and Harris, especially, ended up twisting themselves in political and policy knots, as Sanders unapologetically campaigned for a platform he conceded would raise taxes (but lower health costs overall, he said). Medicare-for-all would end up as one of the defining issues of the 2020 primary, surfacing in numerous debates. Even opponents of the effort, like former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, framed their own health care proposals on Sanders' terms. 5. Hard Stories At Health Care Town Halls Sanders speaks during a health care-focused town hall in Los Angeles on July 25, 2019. At events, attendees often shared stories of struggling with health care access or costs.\n                \n                    \n                    Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sanders speaks during a health care-focused town hall in Los Angeles on July 25, 2019. At events, attendees often shared stories of struggling with health care access or costs. Sanders entered the 2020 presidential campaign as a favorite, not an afterthought. Still, his campaign faced a lot of uncertainties. Most notably: How many progressives who backed Sanders in the two-candidate 2016 contest would migrate to Warren or any of the other two dozen Democrats who entered the race? Bernie 2020 looked very different than Bernie 2016 in several ways. Among them: a deliberate effort to do fewer mega-rallies \u2014 at least in the early months of the race \u2014 and instead focus on more intimate town halls where people in the audience shared their struggles with health care access and costs. In September, a man in Carson City, Nev., told Sanders he was considering suicide because of six-figure medical debt. Campaign staffers credited these intense moments \u2014 always livestreamed and repackaged on social media by the campaign \u2014 as validating and amplifying Sanders' push to overhaul the American health care system. 6. AOC Helps Bernie Bounce Back Following his heart attack, Sanders returned to the presidential campaign trail on Oct. 19, 2019, with a huge rally in New York City, where he was endorsed by progressive star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n                \n                    \n                    Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Following his heart attack, Sanders returned to the presidential campaign trail on Oct. 19, 2019, with a huge rally in New York City, where he was endorsed by progressive star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Still, Sanders spent most of 2019 in Warren's shadow. It was Warren, not Sanders, who was steadily rising in the polls and seemingly consolidating the progressive wing of the party. On Oct. 1, Sanders suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada. In the days following the incident, as the campaign slowly released more details about what had actually happened, there were real questions about whether Sanders could continue campaigning. He was off the trail for about two weeks. Then, at the very end of a televised debate, Sanders' campaign announced a major endorsement: progressive star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. That weekend, she and Sanders rallied in front of more than 20,000 people in New York City. Suddenly Sanders had life again \u2014 his campaign contributions shot up, his poll numbers rose, and it was Warren, not Sanders, who was facing questions about viability. Sanders gained more and more momentum in November, December and January. He won New Hampshire and Nevada, while essentially tying Buttigieg atop the muddled Iowa caucuses. Sanders suddenly was the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. 7. Moderates Unite In a matter of hours on March 2, two fellow candidates, including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden, signaling rapid consolidation behind Biden and against Sanders. Biden would dominate the next day's contests, on Super Tuesday, catapulting to the front-runner position he never relinquished.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In a matter of hours on March 2, two fellow candidates, including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden, signaling rapid consolidation behind Biden and against Sanders. Biden would dominate the next day's contests, on Super Tuesday, catapulting to the front-runner position he never relinquished. Biden won South Carolina big, but Sanders kept his focus on Super Tuesday. All along, his campaign's plan was to build up a massive delegate lead that day in states like California and Texas, and never look back. Sanders campaigned across the country at a frantic pace, holding massive rallies in Massachusetts, Virginia, Texas and elsewhere. Then, on a day in which Sanders flew from Utah to Minnesota to Vermont, everything changed. Buttigieg, who had dropped out the night before, endorsed Biden. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar did the same. So did former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who had ended his campaign months earlier. The race suddenly went from Sanders narrowly having the largest base in a crowded field to essentially a two-candidate race. And Biden, who had appeared on the brink of a humiliating defeat just a few days before, cleaned up. Biden won 10 of 14 states on March 3, then five of six the next week, including a romp in Michigan, a state at the heart of Sanders' 2016 success. The next day, Sanders vowed to stay in the race, but conceded that, \"While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability.\" 8. The Pandemic Freezes The Race Sanders announces he is ending his presidential campaign on Wednesday, via a livestream from his Vermont home. The coronavirus pandemic completely upended traditional campaigning in the last weeks of Sanders' bid.\n                \n                    \n                    Bernie Sanders for President/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sanders announces he is ending his presidential campaign on Wednesday, via a livestream from his Vermont home. The coronavirus pandemic completely upended traditional campaigning in the last weeks of Sanders' bid. But Sanders would not hold another campaign rally in the 2020 race. On March 10, Sanders abruptly cancelled a Cleveland rally due to mounting coronavirus concerns. Soon, even the news conferences and speeches that Sanders and Biden started holding instead were seen as dangerous. The primary was suddenly frozen in place. Neither Sanders nor Biden campaigned in person in the week leading up to primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, and Biden won all three states. Soon, state after state postponed their primaries, and Sanders didn't have any chances to gain ground on Biden, whose delegate lead had grown to more than 300. The Sanders campaign said it would assess its path forward, and Sanders instead focused all his efforts on the federal coronavirus response. He held virtual roundtables on the virus, arguing the global pandemic validated his call for a national government-run health care system, as well as massive federal spending to help the out-of-work and struggling. This week, Sanders abruptly ended his campaign. \"I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour,\" he said via livestream. In 2018, Sanders told NPR that he didn't especially care whether the progressive candidates he was endorsing were winning their primaries. The point, he said, was to push the policies and the platforms more and more into the mainstream. \"I hope they win,\" he said in his Senate office. \"Maybe they don't. But if you get 45% of the vote now, next time you may well win. You have to start somewhere.\" Sanders will not win the presidency this year. But whether it's next year or at some point in the future, the next Democratic president will very likely try to pass a substantial part of the agenda Sanders has pushed for over the past five years.",

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ended his presidential campaign Wednesday, leaving former Vice President Joe Biden uncontested for the Democratic nomination.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Bernie Sanders dropped out of the presidential race today. Here's the Vermont senator speaking to supporters via livestream video. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: I wish I could give you better news, but I think you know the truth. And that is that we are now some 300 delegates behind Vice President Biden, and the path toward victory is virtually impossible. KELLY: Sanders indicates there his departure means former Vice President Joe Biden is now the presumptive Democratic nominee. Let's bring in NPR's Asma Khalid. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi there. KELLY: So this was not unexpected given the clear delegate lead that Joe Biden holds. But how did Bernie Sanders explain his decision today? KHALID: Well, you're right, I should say, Mary Louise. This was not unexpected, and that's in part because the Sanders campaign had said itself a few weeks ago that he would be reassessing things. And that came after a series of pretty crippling losses he had in early March. You know, the way that he explained things today is - I should point out, he would have needed at least 64% of the remaining delegates in order to become the nominee. And while that's not mathematically impossible, it is rather unlikely just given the momentum that he's had in this race and the fact that, frankly, he was not able to broaden the base of progressive supporters that he's had. So I think, you know, today what we heard from him was an acknowledgment of that numerical reality, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has also just upended the entire campaign. And he said in this particular moment, he did not feel like he could continue on in good consciousness. KELLY: He did also speak about what he had accomplished with his campaign, what he feels he has accomplished. Give us some more detail on that. KHALID: He did. You know, he talked about the ideas that he has long championed now being a part of the more mainstream conversation in the Democratic Party, things like a $15 minimum wage, universal health care. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SANDERS: It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe. Today, they are mainstream ideas, and many of them are already being implemented in cities and states across the country. KHALID: And he also talked about the backbone of his coalition. These are young people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SANDERS: Please also appreciate that not only are we winning the struggle ideologically, we are also winning it generationally. The future of our country rests with young people. KHALID: And, you know, Mary Louise, he has had, I would say, a rather large policy influence in the Democratic Party. You know, how many Democratic debates focused on health care specifically around his ideas around \"Medicare for All?\" And, you know, though he was conceding here in these livestream remarks, he was also touting those ideological gains that he's made. KELLY: One big question now, of course, is whether Sanders supporters will shift their support to Joe Biden. Did Sanders endorse Biden today? KHALID: Well, he did not explicitly use those words I endorse Biden. But he has long said that he would support whoever the nominee is. And he reiterated that desire to unify, you know, the entire Democratic Party behind a candidate who could beat Donald Trump. He called Joe Biden himself a very decent man. But Sanders also said something that kind of was unusual. It caught my ear. He said he's going to stay on the ballot for upcoming primaries. The thought is that he'd continue to accumulate delegates, which he could then use at the Democratic National Convention to influence the party's platform and rules. But again, you know, I think he has made it pretty clear throughout this campaign cycle that he would stand behind whoever was the likely nominee. KELLY: What has been the reaction from the Biden camp to the fact that Sanders says he's going to stay on the ballot, he will keep accumulating delegates? KHALID: Well, Biden praised Sanders as a whole. They didn't even acknowledge that. He said that he had, you know, touted these ideas for a long time, that he had not just created a political campaign, he had created a movement. And a lot of this is around the focus that, you know, they're aware of what happened in 2016. They don't want a repeat of that. They want to unify the Democratic Party. KELLY: NPR's Asma Khalid reporting there on the news today, Bernie Sanders dropping out of the 2020 presidential race. Thank you, Asma. KHALID: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.

Editor's note: Sanders has suspended his campaign. There comes a time in every campaign when a candidate needs to make a tough decision. Ending a bid for president is one of the hardest things any candidate can do. They put themselves out there; they open themselves \u2014 and their families \u2014 up to relentless criticism and, nowadays, social media abuse. That's got to be even harder for someone like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who against all odds built a movement and, at 78, likely won't run for president again. The Vermont senator's supporters are fervent and fed up. Many are young and grew up in an era with America at war, enduring economic collapse, crushing student loan debt and now a viral pandemic that only underscores for them the point they've been making all along about a health care system that's inexorably tied to big corporations. \"Medicare for All,\" they say, isn't looking so bad when millions are losing jobs \u2014 and their health care. They want it all fixed, they want it fixed now, and they don't trust the power structures that have been in charge for generations, Democrats included. That change may come someday, but the revolution is not matching the present reality. Sanders' path to the Democratic nomination is getting narrower every day. Former Vice President Joe Biden has a 1,217-to-914 delegate lead over Sanders. To be the nominee, a candidate needs 1,991. That means Biden needs just 46% of the remaining delegates to be the nominee; Sanders needs 64%. In other words, for Sanders to turn this aircraft carrier around, he would need to get at least 64% of the vote in all of the remaining contests to beat Biden. And the opposite looked to be the case heading into Wisconsin, where voting took place Tuesday three weeks after the last primaries. Biden was up 62% to 34% in the latest Marquette Law School poll. Sanders won the Wisconsin primary in 2016 by 13 points. There are no results being released in Wisconsin until Monday. But the Wisconsin outcome could be determinative if it winds up looking like what's happened in previous weeks, with big Biden victories on Super Tuesday and beyond. Sanders, for his part, said last month he would be \"assessing\" his campaign and noted that there wasn't an election for another three weeks, which was Tuesday's Wisconsin primary. \"We are talking to our supporters,\" he added. \"Anybody who suggests that at this point we are ending the campaign is not telling the truth.\" Since then, though, the campaign has mostly taken a back seat. Sanders has shifted focus to his day job as a senator and working on relief for Americans economically besieged by the coronavirus outbreak. Sanders has done some virtual town halls, but the campaign has been all but frozen. And there's a debate going on in Sanders world about what to do next, The Washington Post reported. On one side, there's his campaign manager and a trusted adviser said to be in favor of dropping out; on the other side, a campaign co-chairwoman, some grassroots supporters and Larry Cohen, the head of Our Revolution, a prominent outside group supporting Sanders. Cohen told NPR that he wants Sanders to stay in to have sway within the Democratic National Committee to continue \u2014 or make permanent \u2014 rules changes Sanders fought for, like \"superdelegates\" not being able to vote on the first ballot at the nominating convention. \"That's a bottom line position,\" Cohen said. He also noted that Sanders staying in and amassing more delegates would mean more power to influence the Democratic platform, especially pushing for as progressive a position as possible on health care. \"People like their health insurance?\" Cohen asked rhetorically. \"When 30 million are likely to lose their health care that's employer-based\" because of the coronavirus? He added, \"That's the price of unity. They think unity is salute Joe Biden.\" Biden and Sanders, though, seem to have a warm relationship, something Sanders did not have with Hillary Clinton, who defeated him for the nomination in 2016. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders touch elbows, as they greet each other for a Democratic presidential debate last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders touch elbows, as they greet each other for a Democratic presidential debate last month. \"If I'm the nominee, I can tell you one thing, I would very much want Bernie to be part of the journey,\" Biden said Tuesday on NBC's Today. \"Not as a vice presidential nominee, but just engaging in all the things that he's worked so hard to do, many of which I agree with.\" With the writing on the wall becoming clear, negotiation is happening at the top levels between the campaigns, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Not everyone will come around, and Sanders, of course, would first have to concede, but the goal of beating President Trump and moving the country in a more progressive direction would likely be enough for many of the Sanders faithful to vote for Biden in the fall. \"We are all in if Biden is the nominee,\" Cohen said.",

Bernie Sanders has left a major mark on the party he never formally joined.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Despite two failed attempts for the Democratic nomination, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders has left a major mark on the party he never formally joined. Updated at 1:11 p.m. ET Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders suspended his 2020 presidential campaign Wednesday, bowing to the commanding delegate lead former Vice President Joe Biden established. \"I wish I could give you better news, but I think you know the truth. And that is that we are now some 300 delegates behind Vice President Biden, and the path toward victory is virtually impossible,\" Sanders told supporters in livestreamed remarks, shortly after he had broken the news to campaign staff. Sanders' decision comes weeks after the coronavirus pandemic upended the Democratic race. The worsening outbreak delayed primary contests and the party's nominating convention and halted all in-person campaigning, forcing the two candidates to hold virtual events from their respective homes. Sanders suspended his campaign after mask-wearing voters went to the polls Tuesday in Wisconsin. The state controversially forged ahead with its primary, despite public health concerns. Results for the state's contest are expected on Monday. It was the first state to hold a contest since March 17. Biden swept three primaries that day, capping a month in which he rose from what seemed like the political dead to dominate three straight weeks of multiple-state primaries. Biden won 10 contests on Super Tuesday, five a week later and three more in mid-March, before the virus delayed more than a dozen contests. Sanders, like every other Democratic presidential candidate, had long promised to support the eventual nominee. In his remarks Wednesday, he congratulated Biden, calling him a \"very decent man,\" and promised to \"work with [Biden] to move our progressive ideas forward.\" Biden lauded Sanders in a lengthy statement of his own. Still, Sanders said he'll remain on the ballot in the rest of this year's primaries, in order to win more delegates to bring to the Democratic National Convention. The more pledged delegates Sanders has, the more he'll be able to influence the party's platform and rules. Not long ago, it was Sanders, not Biden, who seemed poised to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders finished atop the muddled Iowa caucuses in a virtual tie, narrowly won New Hampshire, and took the Nevada caucuses in a landslide. But Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, was never able to win broad support beyond his base of core supporters. And when the Democratic field suddenly narrowed after Biden's blowout victory in South Carolina, Biden consolidated most of the voters that had previously split their loyalties among former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and others. Suddenly, Sanders wasn't just knocked out of the front-runner position; he was underperforming his 2016 presidential bid. Biden beat him in several states Sanders carried four years ago, and Biden carried every county in Michigan, the site of Sanders' most surprising 2016 victory over eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. And his vote shares were consistently lower, even when it was effectively a two-candidate race. Sanders conceded he was \"losing the debate over electability\" after that string of losses to Biden but vowed to press on, arguing he was winning the party's \"ideological debate.\" Sanders repeated that argument Wednesday, saying \"few would deny that over the course of the last five years, our movement has won the ideological struggle\" for policies like a $15 minimum wage and universal health care. \"It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe,\" he said. \"Today they are mainstream ideas, and many of them are already being implemented in cities and states across the country.\" Indeed, despite two failed attempts for the Democratic nomination, Sanders has left a major mark on the party he never formally joined. In 2016, his \"Medicare for All\" proposal was far outside the party's mainstream. In 2020, several other presidential candidates had co-sponsored Sanders' signature health care plan. Even candidates like Biden, who opposed Medicare for All, framed their own platforms around Sanders' proposals, promising a large government-run health insurance program as a central component of their plans. Still, Sanders was never able to replicate the coalition of young, progressive and often disaffected voters he put together in 2016. While Sanders is promising to campaign for Biden, it's an open question whether his devoted, progressive base will enthusiastically back a moderate whom Sanders criticized in recent months for past votes for international trade deals and the 2003 Iraq War. Many people in Clinton's camp blamed hostility from Sanders supporters as a reason why she lost the general election to President Trump in 2016 \u2014 though that hostility was exacerbated by hacked and leaked Democratic National Committee emails showing that many party officials had a clear preference for Clinton over Sanders. On Wednesday, Sanders directly addressed supporters who wanted to see him stay in the race: \"I understand that,\" Sanders said, but countered, \"I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour.\" In his statement, Biden said Sanders \"has put his heart and soul into not only running for President, but for the causes and issues he has been dedicated to his whole life.\" He added that \"Sanders and his supporters have changed the dialogue in America.\"",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, U.S. senator from Vermont, talks about the coronavirus relief bill on Wednesday in one of several speeches about the crisis streamed on his campaign website.\n                \n                    \n                    berniesanders.com via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, U.S. senator from Vermont, talks about the coronavirus relief bill on Wednesday in one of several speeches about the crisis streamed on his campaign website. After Bernie Sanders suffered three straight weeks of big losses across the country, the Vermont senator returned home to \"assess his campaign.\" It appeared in that moment that Sanders' campaign was all but over. He trailed former Vice President Joe Biden by about 300 delegates and was facing calls to drop out. The conventional wisdom in political circles was that Biden would effectively wrap up the nomination by the end of March. But the coronavirus outbreak has largely put the presidential race on hold, with most upcoming primaries postponed and all in-person campaigning canceled. The immediate political focus has shifted to stopping the pandemic and offering financial relief to struggling Americans. And in this moment, Sanders' voice and vision seem to have had a resurgence. His allies and supporters are convinced that as the crisis has unfolded and the U.S. suffers from record unemployment, the issues that the Vermont senator has long focused on, such as income inequality and \"Medicare for All,\" will force the country to have a reckoning about its financial and health care systems. In other words, they're convinced the crisis is resuscitating Sanders' agenda. \"The reality that so many people have health care attached to their jobs and how vulnerable that makes them is showing its face right now,\" said Ana Maria Archila, the co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, a coalition of progressive groups that endorsed Sanders. \"I think many of his ideas, which were deemed radical just a few months ago, are now being promoted.\" As evidence, supporters of Sanders point to recent bills in Congress that include cash payments to individuals, expanded unemployment benefits and paid sick time \u2014 all ideas, they note, that the senator has long championed. They also point to a speech that Sanders delivered from the Senate floor last week that went viral, in which he ripped into a group of conservative Republicans who were concerned that the roughly $2 trillion relief package that Congress was set to pass might result in some low-income workers making more money because of expanded unemployment benefits. But the senator's critics suggest, despite the big speeches and viral videos, that he was not as present on Capitol Hill as others. Some point to his former presidential rival Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was key in shaping the corporate oversight portion of the bill. In fact, last weekend, Sanders skipped a vote in Congress to instead hold a virtual town hall from Vermont with members of the \"squad,\" freshman Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. Still, Sanders has remained in a policymaking role in this moment, and that gave him a spotlight that his primary opponent does not have. Biden, who for most of his adult life was in some form of elected office, found himself in the strange situation of being somewhat powerless \u2014 no longer a senator and no longer a vice president. No media outlets took his virtual coronavirus speeches live, but they routinely turned to updates from Capitol Hill, where Congress was debating the largest rescue package in American history. Campaigning against the virus Outside of Congress, Sanders continues to hold virtual town halls and send emails to his supporters, but his message has shifted.  \"In every classical facet of what a campaign does, we've basically moved away from that and become a coronavirus campaign,\" said Faiz Shakir, Sanders' campaign manager. The campaign is not regularly contrasting with and critiquing Biden. Instead, it is largely focused on educating people about the virus and the economic assistance available. The campaign is no longer actively spending on advertising and diverting money that would otherwise fill its coffers. \"The fundraising that you associate with the campaign, raising for the candidate, has all suspended,\" said Shakir. \"All we're raising for is groups who are doing front-line work to help vulnerable communities. We've raised over $3 million.\" As for the Sanders candidacy itself, Shakir insists the senator is still reassessing his future. \"It's gonna be a very steep road, I would not deny that for a moment,\" Sanders told NPR's Morning Edition a few days ago. At the same time, he suggested that he would like to continue debating Biden, as the former vice president has said they've had enough debates. Sanders supporters and allies do not know if he will stay in the race and fight until the last primary, now postponed to June 23, less than three weeks before the scheduled start of the Democratic National Convention. Nor are they saying he should. But they emphasize that the senator has more influence and power in this moment because he's a presidential candidate. \"The campaign is a vehicle through which he can continue to engage people, so even for that reason alone the campaign is important,\" said Archila. Without a national campaign, Sanders' megaphone wouldn't be as loud \u2014 whether it's for himself, his issues or aiding the coronavirus crisis. \"It's Sanders' last stand in electoral politics,\" said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"He's old enough that I don't think anyone expects him to make another run for the presidency. He may be in his last term in the Senate or near it. Right now, he still has something of a national stage. Once he leaves the campaign, that will be gone.\"",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., greet one another before they participate in a Democratic presidential primary debate.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden (left) and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., greet one another before they participate in a Democratic presidential primary debate. Just before the Democratic debate Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out guidelines encouraging Americans not to gather in groups of 50 or more for the next eight weeks. Eight weeks. Americans are hunkering down, professional and college sports have suspended seasons, many states have closed schools. But voting \u2014 at least for now \u2014 continues. And so did the first one-on-one Democratic primary debate of this cycle, albeit in a very different way than originally planned. The debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders took place inside a CNN studio in Washington, D.C., rather than before an audience in Arizona, one of the states voting Tuesday in the primaries along with Florida, Ohio and Illinois. What to make of the kind of debate that's never been seen before? Here are the takeaways from Sunday night: 1. Coronavirus dominates As to be expected, the novel coronavirus dominated the early part of the debate. The candidates tried to distinguish themselves from President Trump, and it started before the debate even began with an elbow bump between the two men in lieu of a handshake. During their answers, Biden displayed a command of the levers of government: saying, for example, that he would deploy the military to address the coronavirus crisis, and explaining how. Sanders, on the other hand, pivoted to talk about the broader ills of the U.S. health care system and tried to promote his \"Medicare for All\" plan. Biden pointed out that a single-payer system didn't contain the virus in Italy, which is now on lockdown. In the past two weeks, exit polls have shown voters saying they trust Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis. And Biden's interagency expertise played to that strength. 2. Biden commits to a woman as VP... and other things Everyone expected the coronavirus conversation to be the news, and it was. But Biden created a viral moment on a different subject; he declared he would put a woman on the ticket as vice president, if he's the nominee. \"There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow,\" Biden said. \"I would pick a woman to be my vice president.\" Moderator Dana Bash of CNN followed up to confirm, and Biden said yes, he was committing to putting a woman on the ticket. Sanders hedged a bit, saying that \"in all likelihood\" he would, too, but that he wanted a \"progressive woman.\" It was a smart, strategic move by Biden's team, not just to gain attention, but also to help pacify those on the left who have either been slow to warm \u2014 or been outright hostile \u2014 to the former vice president's nomination. Reaction from the left on Twitter to his move was probably the best Biden has received the entire campaign. It's all part of his effort to court not just Sanders' supporters, but Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's, too. Also this week, Biden took up Warren's bankruptcy bill plan and endorsed free tuition at state colleges. Pointedly, Biden also committed during this debate to putting a black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court; to no new fracking; and to only deporting people in the U.S. illegally who are also felons. That's an olive branch to progressive Latinos, many of whom prefer Sanders and are still smarting at President Barack Obama's high deportation rates. 3. Their policy differences were obvious, but Biden appeared at times to look past Sanders Overall, Biden was steady. He had moments of using impolitic words (like calling people who are in the U.S. illegally \"aliens\" before correcting himself), but Biden mostly appeared in command. It helps when you have a more than 150-delegate lead. Because Democrats allocate their delegates proportionally according to the primary vote, that's a very difficult lead for Sanders to overcome, especially as the race heads into states that favor Biden. The debate grew acrimonious at times, and Sanders accused Biden of being funded, in part, by the health care industry. But Biden didn't really want to get into it. \"I'm not going to get into the back-and-forth about our politics,\" Biden said, looking away from Sanders to the moderators. Even Sanders looked like he didn't want to mortally wound Biden. \"I know your heart is in the right place,\" Sanders said of Biden at one point. Sanders does appear to have a warmth for Biden that he never had for 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton. The campaigns have talked privately about how the two men have a long-held fondness for each other, which again proves that politics is so much about the personal. 4. Debates over decades-old statements and votes felt small There's nothing that gets an American audience to the edge of their seats quite like talk of Erskine-Bowles, Dick Lugar and cost of living adjustments. The danger with a debate between two old Senate hands is they sometimes slip into Senate-ese. In fact, they sometimes seem most in their element talking about who wrote what part of what bill and who really killed what amendment and why. But scoring points on things people did or didn't do, said or didn't say decades ago felt small, especially given the candidates' dominant positions in the race \u2014 and the acute crisis at hand for the country. Overall, Biden had a solid debate. Because of his delegate lead, even a draw would have given him a win.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will debate tonight, one-on-one for the first time. The debate comes as Biden racks up a lead in delegates, and there will be no audience due to coronavirus precautions.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Tonight, Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden will debate each other one on one. And it's not just the stage that will look pretty empty after having been so crowded for so long. The debate is happening in a TV studio here in Washington with no audience due to coronavirus concerns. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea joins us now with a preview. Hi. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Hi, glad to be here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Don, neither candidate will have a cheering section tonight, and that's not the only aspect of this campaign that's been affected by the coronavirus, right? GONYEA: Yeah. I mean, where do I begin? The rallies are done for now at least. And when will people feel comfortable coming back to a rally? So that's an open question. Joe Biden held a virtual event on Friday. Sanders did a virtual fireside chat but so much of a campaign is about human contact. I mean, they're all about bringing people together and creating community and energy. How do you canvas? How do you knock on doors? I mean, the answer is you don't. We have seen both Biden and Sanders give speeches trying to show how they would handle a crisis. So that kind of thing is going on. One other thing about tonight though, Lulu, not only is there no audience but also one of the moderators. Jorge Ramos has withdrawn from the debate. He's self-quarantining because he may have had secondhand exposure. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Just showing how widespread this is. Joe Biden has been building a lot of momentum, though, as well as a pretty solid delegate lead. Is this debate Bernie Sanders' last stand to stop Biden from running away with the nomination? GONYEA: It could be. There won't be many more opportunities like a debate. But Biden's lead and his momentum will be extremely tough for Sanders to overcome, even with a lot of primaries to go. Sanders himself is admitting that his broad movement of especially young voters has not been showing up at the polls quite as he expected. Last week, he gave a speech that really made it clear, A, he is not dropping out. But there was also a shift in tone. He's not pushing for Biden and the Democratic Party to address the issues he's been running on and those issues that are so important to young voters. And he says to the future of the party. On Wednesday, he even gave Biden a heads up of how that would go. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: Joe, what are you going to do to end the absurdity of the United States of America being the only major country on earth where health care is not a human right? Are you really going to veto a Medicare for All bill if it is passed in Congress? GONYEA: And Sanders also said he will press Biden tonight on housing and college affordability, climate change and all of that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What about Joe Biden? What is his big challenge tonight? GONYEA: People will certainly be listening to what he and both candidates say about the coronavirus. But when you look at the debates so far, Biden has mostly gotten by with kind of disappearing in the crowd. That will not be an option tonight. And he'll need to answer Sanders' challenge on young voters and on progressive priorities. Ultimately Biden may be on the path to the nomination, but he still needs a really strong performance. His performance on the trail has not always been really solid. At times, it's been uneven. He has to start demonstrating that he's steady, that he's in command, that he's ready to be the nominee. GARCIA-NAVARRO: NPR's Don Gonyea thank you so much. GONYEA: It's my pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Trump is trying to manage a national crisis in a re-election year. But how is that message coming across, and how are his democratic rivals also trying to influence voters at this time?  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: With just months to go before he stands for reelection, President Trump is trying to manage a major national crisis and his own political future. Here's part of the message he sent at a White House press conference yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The choice we make, the precautions we put into place are critical to overcoming the virus, reducing its spread and shortening the duration of the pandemic, which is what it is. MONTAGNE: Meanwhile, his Democratic rivals are trying to send their own messages to both help the public and their campaigns. NPR political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben has been following this and joins us now. Good morning. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: The president is working to marshal resources, both for the government and the private sector. But, you know, often, of course, presidents are most influential as messengers. What do some of the experts you've been talking to say is really helpful in a crisis like this? KURTZLEBEN: Well, first things first, they say that a crisis like this - I mean, crises like this are rare. This crisis is unique. Mike Leavitt, who was a Health and Human Services secretary under President George W. Bush, he pointed out to me that this isn't like a hurricane or a tornado where there's a discrete localized impact. It's - for a lot of people, it's a sort of rolling potential disaster. And people are, for an extended period of time, continually trying to avoid it. MIKE LEAVITT: These are complicated, tricky emergencies different than a weather event - a tornado or a hurricane - different from a terrorism event - different in a sense that they happen everywhere at the same time. KURTZLEBEN: So with this happening everywhere to all Americans at the same time, I mean, the most fundamental thing is to communicate truthful information. Now, CNN this week counted literally dozens of falsehoods about coronavirus that Trump and his administration had spread. And that was before, by the way, his Wednesday night Oval Office address in which he seemed to get his own policies wrong. MONTAGNE: Yeah, right. And people, I think, have a sense of no control, and they really are looking for somebody in control in a situation like this. Keeping people from panicking can, though, be very hard, even for a president. How does he manage that? KURTZLEBEN: Well, so one way is keeping experts close at hand, sort of showing that you have smart people around you telling you what to do. I asked a scientist, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins - her name was Emily Gurley - about this. And she pointed out, you know, it's not just showing people that you're getting good information, but also that, listen; I have people telling me when I need to change course if we need to change course and that we can do that quickly. And the president was putting Anthony Fauci and other experts out front in an effort to do that. Now, it is also true, though, that if there's a disconnect between what the president says and what experts suggest, that could add anxiety because of mixed messages. For example, he announced that travel - the travel restrictions regarding Europe, and some experts have said that that just isn't useful. MONTAGNE: And, of course, the Democratic candidates have not shied away from criticizing Trump's responses here. What has stood out for you from Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders? KURTZLEBEN: Well, one thing is, first of all, they both gave speeches this week. Actually, Sanders gave two. And a big thing is, you know, they didn't really criticize each other in those speeches. They both seemed to have backed off of viewing each other as rivals here. And, of course, they don't want to be seen as taking political advantage. Now, that said, they are definitely criticizing Donald Trump's governing style. Joe Biden this week called it a failure on testing that is colossal, and he also called it a failure of planning, leadership and execution. Now, Sanders also has said this administration is, quote, \"largely incompetent.\" Now, however, they are taking a little bit of advantage. Sanders is taking the opportunity to promote \"Medicare for All\" right now. Biden is pivoting to the general election. Really, they're just trying to show that they could be president during a crisis. MONTAGNE: NPR political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben, thanks for joining us. KURTZLEBEN: Yes. Thank you.

Politics and governing can often collide in the middle of a crisis, especially when both hinge on what message a leader is sending the public. Given that we're in the height of an election, the collision may have been inevitable. President Trump delivered a primetime televised address about coronavirus and canceled political events, followed by a Rose Garden press conference flanked by public and private sector leaders. The men running to replace him, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, brought forward their own coronavirus plans, gave their own speeches and also cancelled campaign events. Political leaders are usually not medical professionals. But they play a crucial role in informing the public about crises, even while they attempt to advance their own goals like winning an election in November, a remarkably difficult balance to strike. This crisis is different For a sitting president, pandemics are unlike most other major crises, says one former federal official. \"These are complicated, tricky emergencies \u2014 different than a weather event, a tornado or a hurricane, different than terrorism, different in the sense that they happen everywhere at the same time,\" said Mike Leavitt, who served as Health and Human Services Secretary to President George W. Bush. This means that there's no single site for a president to visit and assess the damage, and there's no single city whose residents the president can comfort after the fact. Instead, it's a rolling potential disaster that people are, for an extended period of time, continually trying to avoid. More fundamental than any communications strategy is the need to communicate correct information. CNN this week counted literally dozens of falsehoods about coronavirus Trump had spread. And that was before his Wednesday night Oval Office address, in which the president got his own policies wrong. It's not just that misinformation could lead people to downplay or misunderstand how easily they could get the virus (or what to do once they get it); it also can unnecessarily stoke fear, according to one expert. \"If people see a disconnect between what scientists say and what he says, that in itself can create some anxiety,\" said Emily Gurley, associate scientist who specializes in epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. She added that this also applies when announced policies \u2014 like the restrictions on European travel \u2014 conflict with scientists' recommendations. President Trump held a news conference regarding the coronavirus in the Rose Garden at the White House on Friday, along with members of his administration and business leaders.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump held a news conference regarding the coronavirus in the Rose Garden at the White House on Friday, along with members of his administration and business leaders. The point of showing that experts are involved in decision-making, Gurley said, is that leaders need to convey not only that they have good information, but that they are willing to change direction when necessary. \"If the situation is changing so rapidly, we need to be really flexible. So I would focus more on process,\" she said. \"That means that you have experts driving decisions about policy, advising on our collective best chance at mitigating impact at any given point in time, given the data that we have.\" There's also an important balance for leaders to strike, according to Corinne Hoare, lecturer in crisis communication at American University who worked at the White House Office of Management and Budget during the 2008 financial crisis. She says the challenge is being honest about the seriousness of the situation without stoking panic. Hoare points to President Trump's attempts to downplay the seriousness of the virus. \"I think he in his own way was trying to calm people down,\" she said. \"But the problem is, when people are very outraged, just telling them that it's going to blow over and it's going to be OK, can actually make them even more outraged.\" Candidates striking a careful balance There's another difficult balance for politicians strike during a pre-election national crisis: how to show they should be elected (or reelected) president without appearing to overly politicize people's very real fears and losses. While their remarks were about raising awareness, Biden and Sanders are still trying to win votes, with a shared goal of defeating Trump. The two drew contrasts in their speeches but also held off on attacking each other. Sanders devoted significant time this week, particularly in his Friday speech, to talk about his signature policy of Medicare for All in relation to the coronavirus outbreak. He also pushed for other expansions of the social safety net to deal with the crisis (like providing paid leave and, eventually, a free vaccine). Hand sanitizer are placed near reporters as Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks about coronavirus on Thursday in Burlington, Vt.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Krupa/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hand sanitizer are placed near reporters as Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks about coronavirus on Thursday in Burlington, Vt. Biden seemed to be firmly pivoting to the general election in his coronavirus speech on Thursday. Ahead of it, a campaign official said the goal of the speech was to appear \"presidential, not political,\" and to \"offer a view into how Biden will lead in times of crisis as president.\" But both men also more strongly sought to contrast themselves with President Trump. \"The administration's failure on testing is colossal, and it's a failure of planning, leadership, and execution,\" Biden said on Thursday. Similarly, Sanders took aim at Trump, saying in his Thursday remarks that \"the current administration is largely incompetent, and its incompetence and recklessness has threatened the lives of many people.\" Meanwhile, Trump's campaign has been working to attack Biden, saying he made \"irresponsible remarks\" over the swine flu in 2009. As NPR's Brian Naylor reported, that may have been in reference to Biden at the time contradicting official recommendations over the flu. No matter who wins the election, they will no doubt be dealing with the fallout of this crisis after November. \"I honestly think that, like 9/11, this really just exposed how unprepared we were to the threat of our safety,\" said Corinne Hoare. \"It's really shaken us to the core. And I think our lives will never be the same. I think, you know, how governments entities operate will forever be changed, how we interact with each other.\" It's possible, then, that the lasting shock that Americans feel from this outbreak may mean politicians are able to make lasting alterations to the nation's readiness systems. Mustering that political will can otherwise be difficult. \"Anytime you talk about a pandemic, it's complicated, because before a pandemic happens, everything you say sounds alarmist,\" Leavitt said. \"After it occurs, anything you've said or done seems inadequate.\"",

Bernie Sanders is staying in the race for president, but he made it obvious on Wednesday that he sees Joe Biden's clear path to the nomination. \"While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,\" Sanders said. The recent underdog added that he disagrees that Biden is the stronger candidate to take on President Trump, \"but that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.\" To date, the former vice president has won 15 states, while the Vermont senator has won or led the popular vote in eight. Biden currently has a delegate lead of around 150, with a favorable map of states ahead. Sanders has acknowledged that the movement he promised to deliver him the nomination is not showing up in big enough numbers. But he's warning Democrats not to write off the strongest parts of his coalition \u2014 young voters and Latinos, particularly emphasizing the former on Wednesday: \"We are winning the generational debate.\" \"Today, I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,\" Sanders said. \"And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.\" Sanders promised to show up at the debate on Sunday in Arizona to face Biden one-on-one, and basically offered him a cheat sheet: \"Let me be very frank as to the questions that I will be asking Joe.\" Sanders listed off issues central to his campaign, which he says are very important to younger progressives: health care costs, climate change, income inequality, student debt, racial disparities in criminal justice, immigration and housing affordability. So why tip Biden off to how you're going to challenge him on Sunday? Maybe Bernie Sanders wants Joe Biden to succeed. Sanders continues to say that he likes Biden and that defeating Trump is the most important thing this year. Sanders has pledged unequivocally to support his opponent if he himself loses the nomination, something he has done more vigorously and more often than he did in 2016. Despite disparaging the party, and though some of his supporters often get into vitriolic arguments, particularly online, Sanders is clear that he does not want to hand the election to Republicans. Given the strong numbers Biden put up with African American voters and white, non-college men in Michigan \u2014 much stronger than Hillary Clinton four years ago \u2014 he would perhaps not need Sanders' movement to overcome the small margins Trump won by in the Midwest. But Biden opened the door in his own speech on Tuesday night. \"I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal,\" Biden said. \"And together, we'll defeat Donald Trump.\" He then reiterated, \"We'll defeat him together.\" And on Wednesday, it seemed as though Sanders was at least in part responding to that call, essentially laying down for Biden a challenge and a road map to secure his support and extend a winning coalition to the left. Some of what Sanders dared Biden on wasn't too challenging. He asked Biden, \"Are you really going to veto a 'Medicare for All' bill, if it is passed in Congress?\" The qualifier is an easy out for Biden. If Sanders' single-payer, \"Medicare for All\" system passed Congress, that would mean the political winds had shifted dramatically \u2014 that at least some Republicans and moderate Democrats who opposed that plan came on board, because their constituents were also on board. That's an unlikely reality in 2021 if Biden were the new president. But on the other issues, Sanders is asking Biden to show at the debate on Sunday that he simply gets the message. And it was telling that Sanders was offering this detailed warning to the Democratic establishment for the future, beyond 2020. The Vermont senator \u2014 who remains a registered independent, and who is often accused of wanting to burn the Democratic Party down \u2014 was instead offering advice. Sanders seemed to indicate that as he sees the presidential nomination slipping away, he wants the party to thrive by addressing the issues he cares about the most. Sanders is not conceding. He'll be at the next debate and in the next contests. His allies say a good debate and a Biden gaffe could turn the tide, and Biden doesn't yet have even half the delegates he needs to secure the Democratic nomination. But given the big losses this week, the question for Sanders had been: What is he going to do? Now he may have put the ball back in Biden's court: If he's running away with the nomination, what is the front-runner going to do if he wants to bring Sanders along and unify the party more quickly?",

            "article_content": "At the outset of this campaign cycle,  progressives seemed torn between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but in the fall of 2019 progressives began to coalesce around the Vermont senator.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: At the outset of this presidential campaign, progressives were torn between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. But eventually, in states that have held primaries, they picked a side, and many of them chose Sanders. The story of how that happened explains part of Warren's downfall. NPR's Asma Khalid has that story. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: In February of 2015, I went up to New Hampshire to meet a group of Elizabeth Warren superfans. They were trying to draft her into the 2016 presidential race. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: When I say Warren, you say run. Warren. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Run. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Warren. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Run. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Warren. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Run. KHALID: One of the groups behind the effort was Democracy for America. Charles Chamberlain is the chair. CHARLES CHAMBERLAIN: We believed that she would have been a better candidate than Hillary Clinton. KHALID: At the time, Warren was adored by progressives as this charismatic star on late night TV who had fought the big banks during the recession. But just last week, Chamberlain's group endorsed Sanders over Warren. CHAMBERLAIN: The change between that time is that, look, when we were trying to get Elizabeth Warren to run back in 2014, '15, that was before Bernie Sanders had run for president. And Bernie Sanders ran in 2016 an incredible campaign and even moved the entire Democratic Party to the left. KHALID: Late last summer, when Warren was holding mega-rallies with seemingly never-ending selfie lines, the progressive community was not so sure what to do. In September, the Working Families Party became the first major group to endorse a candidate, and it chose Warren. Here's the group's director, Maurice Mitchell, at a rally in New York City. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MAURICE MITCHELL: Elizabeth Warren has been a personal hero to many WFP members. Her critique of the financial industry helped lay the groundwork for Occupy Wall Street. KHALID: Then in October, a blow to Warren. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Sanders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: We right now have one of the best Democratic presidential primary fields in a generation, and much of that is thanks to the work that Bernie Sanders has done. GEORGE GOEHL: You started to see dominoes fall after that. KHALID: That last voice is George Goehl. He's the director of People's Action, another group that endorsed Sanders. He says his group liked Sanders' authenticity, but they were also focused on electability. GOEHL: A lot of us believe Senator Sanders is uniquely capable of winning and beating Trump. KHALID: Some progressive organizations made a point of insisting their endorsements were not because of anything Warren did, but because of Sanders' credibility and consistency on issues like health care and climate change. Still, others, like Natalia Delgado (ph) with the Center for Popular Democracy, says there were a couple of key distinctions. NATALIA DELGADO: The sort of defining factors for us between Bernie and Warren was his stance on a moratorium of deportations. KHALID: In recent years, immigration has increasingly become a pillar of the progressive agenda, especially with Donald Trump as president. DELGADO: Between that and her sort of distancing herself from \"Medicare for All,\" and when she thought she would be able to get it done really, you know, distanced her from our folks. KHALID: Voters who liked Warren mentioned her plans, but Sanders had a tendency of taking the ideas further. Warren promised a two-cent wealth tax on people with a net worth over $50 million. Sanders upped her and made it $32 million. Warren promised affordable child care. Sanders promised free child care. Evan Weber is the political director of Sunrise. It's a movement of thousands of young people focused on climate change. They also chose Sanders even though Warren has been a friend of theirs in the Senate. And so I asked him... If this were, like, a different race in a different context, Warren might have had your guys' backing? EVAN WEBER: I think that's fair to say, yeah. I mean, I think her presidency would represent one of the biggest step forwards for the progressive movement in the country. KHALID: In the end, it was a tough decision. But many went with Sanders because they saw him as the purest progressive. Asma Khalid, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "A month after the Iowa caucuses, Super Tuesday offered up the first look at how a diverse swath of the country could vote in the Democratic presidential primary race. Now that more than 1,200 counties across 18 states have voted, a clearer picture is emerging of whom different segments of the Democratic voter base are backing. Take, for example, the split among counties with high and low unemployment rates. In those with relatively low unemployment \u2014 less than 4% \u2014 voters split almost evenly between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But voters in counties with high unemployment \u2014 above 7.2% \u2014 supported Biden far more often than Sanders. Loading... It's a contradiction that may also be a hurdle for Sanders: He's running on a platform of free health insurance and free college, but the places where he's doing best have higher rates of people with bachelor's degrees and health insurance coverage. Biden is doing better at the other end of the spectrum. Measuring votes by county demographics has its limitations. There are, of course, wealthy people in poor counties, and there are people of color in predominantly white counties. A traditional way to try to solve this problem is with exit polling, which uses surveys to estimate the attitudes of subsets of voters. But exit polls are just that \u2014 estimates \u2014 while voting totals show the raw numbers of how voters split. NPR used the Census Bureau's American Community Survey data joined with Associated Press election results to determine vote totals by county demographics. Neither former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg nor Sen. Elizabeth Warren came close to the front-runners in any of the demographic splits post-Super Tuesday. Bloomberg announced on Wednesday that he was suspending his campaign, and he joined fellow former candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar in endorsing Biden. Warren suspended her campaign Thursday and has not endorsed any of the remaining candidates. In the once-crowded Democratic primary field, Biden had staked his position in the race as being the candidate who would appeal most to black Americans. After his underwhelming performance in Iowa and New Hampshire, which are more than 90% white, the importance of that was clear. Post-Super Tuesday data show that in those counties that were most white, Sanders narrowly beat out Biden. But the former vice president fared better in counties with higher percentages of nonwhite residents, beating Sanders in those counties. Sanders still held his own though \u2014 in part because of the large Latino vote in California, a state the senator won. Loading... The differences were more drastic by education level. Nearly half of voters in counties with the lowest education levels choose Biden. He beat Sanders by 27 percentage points in those counties. Counties with higher education levels cast the majority of votes through Super Tuesday because of their larger populations. And in these places it was much closer: Biden beat Sanders by just 4 percentage points. Loading... Biden and Sanders also fared roughly the same among the counties with the highest rates of health insurance. But Biden did better than Sanders in counties with low rates of health insurance \u2014 despite the senator's plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act health care policy with a \"Medicare for All\" system. Loading... Of all the county breakdowns analyzed, Biden had his strongest showing among residents of counties with low median household incomes (less than $42,200). He earned 50% of that vote, while Sanders earned less than half that. In the wealthiest counties, Biden beat Sanders by just 3 percentage points. Loading... All data are from Associated Press vote counts and the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey.",

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks outside her home in Cambridge, Mass., after she dropped out of the Democratic presidential race on Thursday. Updated at 1:15 p.m. ET Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ended her bid for the presidency on Thursday, acknowledging her place as the last major female candidate in the race \"and all those little girls who are gonna have to wait four more years.\" The decision comes after disappointing finishes in all nominating contests so far, including Super Tuesday. She hasn't won or come in second in any states \u2014 and even finished third in her home state of Massachusetts. \"For every American who desperately wants to see our nation healed and some decency and honor restored to our government, this fight goes on. And sure, the fight may take a new form, but I will be in that fight, and I want you in this fight with me. We will persist,\" Warren told campaign staffers after announcing her decision. Warren's exit leaves just former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard actively seeking the Democratic nomination. Biden leads Sanders in the delegate count, with Gabbard holding just one delegate after the Super Tuesday contests. Warren was asked by reporters outside her home in Cambridge, Mass., about which former rival she might endorse and declined to announce anything immediately. \"Let's take a deep breath and spend a little time on that. We don't have to decide this minute,\" Warren said. In what had been a diverse field of candidates, Warren briefly led the pack nationally along with Biden in October and November, according to RealClearPolitics. Despite frequently turning in strong debate performances, Warren struggled to win over voters. During a debate last month, she effectively attacked former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg over his company's use of nondisclosure agreements in sexual harassment cases. As a candidate, Warren eschewed some of the traditional trappings of presidential politics. She didn't hire a pollster and financed her campaign mostly through small-dollar contributions from supporters instead of targeting large donors. But as her candidacy started to look endangered, she didn't protest when a super PAC funded by big donors spent nearly $15 million on her behalf ahead of Super Tuesday. Warren didn't shy from making her gender a part of her campaign, for example, by touting her \"nevertheless she persisted\" slogan and taking the stage to the Dolly Parton's anthem to working women, \"9 to 5.\" But she made gender just one component of her broader economic populist message, pushing child care policies alongside her raft of proposals. Warren was asked after dropping out about the role gender played in the campaign. \"That is the trap question for every woman. If you say, 'Yeah, there was sexism in this race,' everyone says, 'Whiner!' And if you say, 'No, there was no sexism,' about a bazillion women think, 'What planet do you live on?' \" she replied. \"I promise you this: I will have a lot more to say on that subject later on.\" Being the \"woman with a plan\" quickly became Warren's identity on the campaign trail. It also became a liability when she started weathering attacks, first for not having a way to pay for Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" proposal, which she supports, and then over her eventual proposal to pay for that plan. (Sanders, for his part, has not yet released a detailed plan for how he would pay for Medicare for All if he's elected.) While she was considered Sanders' top competitor among progressive voters, embracing single-payer health care and wide-scale student-debt forgiveness, in the runup to Iowa, Warren attempted to pitch herself as a unity candidate. She started explicitly thanking her fellow candidates, including those who had dropped out, for their contributions to the race. A former Harvard Law professor whose research on personal bankruptcy led her shaped her progressive outlook, Warren entered politics via her interest in policy. She was a key architect of portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill, especially around the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But she could not secure Senate confirmation to lead the agency and wound up successfully challenging GOP Sen. Scott Brown in 2012. Warren was the first major Democratic candidate to step into the 2020 race, announcing an exploratory committee on Dec. 30, 2018, before formally announcing her candidacy on Feb. 9, 2019.

            "article_content": "Former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg suspended his presidential campaign Sunday night \u2014 but not before exceeding early expectations.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for president tonight. Buttigieg had suspended his presidential campaign last night after a disappointing result in South Carolina this weekend on top of a poor showing a week earlier in Nevada. But Buttigieg created a campaign that far exceeded early expectations. In fact, it made history. NPR's Don Gonyea looks back at the journey of the candidate often called simply Mayor Pete. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Let's start with the name. There was a steep learning curve. It was Pete who? There were T-shirts with bold letters - the word boot followed by edge and edge again. This is from CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAKE TAPPER: How do you pronounce your last name? PETE BUTTIGIEG: Buttigieg. TAPPER: Buttigieg. BUTTIGIEG: Yeah. Say that three times fast. Either way, it comes out Buttigieg. TAPPER: So boot edge edge, not Buddha judge? BUTTIGIEG: Either way, it gets you there. GONYEA: And there were three other big biographical details. His age - he was 37 when he started running. He's a military veteran. He served in Afghanistan. And he's a married gay man. That last thing often came up in the context of his Christian faith. Almost a year ago at a town hall on CNN, he was asked about a fellow politician from Indiana, Vice President Mike Pence, and differences between Pence's faith and his own. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BUTTIGIEG: How could he allow himself to become the cheerleader of the porn star presidency? Is it that he stopped believing in Scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump? I don't know. I don't know. (APPLAUSE) GONYEA: The moment went viral. And suddenly, his events, especially in Iowa, were packed, some drawing over 1,500 attendees. People suddenly knew his name. His poll numbers climbed, too. And Pete Buttigieg was now in the top tier of candidates. He evolved over time. Early on, his positions were more progressive. He advocated for \"Medicare for All\" without any caveats. Later, he backed away from that. And then at a debate, he went after Elizabeth Warren on her lack of details around her proposal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BUTTIGIEG: Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multitrillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. GONYEA: Support grew. Then in Iowa, even amid the confusion of the vote counting, he used his caucus night rally to essentially declare victory. Another strong showing in New Hampshire. His supporters tended to be older and - a real problem - they were overwhelmingly white. That was a barrier in the next two contests, Nevada and South Carolina. In debates and town halls, he often acknowledged shortcomings in dealing with concerns of African American citizens as mayor of South Bend. This is from a rally in Las Vegas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BUTTIGIEG: There were also a lot of times we didn't get it right. There were things I could not see because I don't have the lived experience of being treated differently because of the color of my skin. GONYEA: After Senator Bernie Sanders' big win in Nevada, Buttigieg gave a stern warning about nominating a candidate who is too far to the left. And last night, in dropping out, he called for unity among Democrats. But there was also this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BUTTIGIEG: We need leadership to heal a divided nation, not drive us further apart. We need a broad-based agenda that can truly deliver for the American people, not one that gets lost in ideology. GONYEA: Speaking in his hometown of South Bend, he looked back at a year of defying expectations and used the moment to cite the historic nature of his campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BUTTIGIEG: And we sent a message to every kid out there wondering if whatever marks them out as different means they are somehow destined to be less than - to see that someone who once felt that exact same way can become a leading American presidential candidate with his husband at his side. (APPLAUSE) GONYEA: Many will be watching him as someone with a viable future in presidential politics. And should Buttigieg run again, he'll be able to skip the part about teaching people how to say his name. Don Gonyea, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is suspending her presidential campaign, and the Democrat plans to endorse former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday night. Former Sen. Harry Reid also endorsed Biden.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: OK. As we approach Super Tuesday, there is a lot of campaign activity to keep track of. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden. Buttigieg suspended his own presidential bid last night. Also today, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar plans to suspend her campaign, and she also endorsed Biden. They're set to appear together in Dallas. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid has been traveling with the Biden campaign. She joins us now. Hey, Asma. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey there. CHANG: All right. Let's begin with this Buttigieg endorsement. What did he say tonight? KHALID: Well, it just happened a few minutes ago here in Dallas. And he said that he was delighted to endorse Biden, in part because he feels like, you know, this is not just about winning the presidency; it's about winning these local Senate and House races. And he made some sort of, I think, coded references to Bernie Sanders, suggesting that being the loudest is not always about being right. He also mentioned that he feels like Joe Biden is just a particularly decent person. He viewed that, he says, when he was run against him, but also when he saw Joe Biden come to his own hometown of South Bend while he was vice president. CHANG: OK. Just to step back for a moment, though, I mean, we see endorsements from Buttigieg, from Klobuchar, along with an endorsement from former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, which also came today for Biden. How big a deal do you think are all these endorsements put together today? KHALID: So, Ailsa, I mean, it's tricky. I mean, for Joe Biden, this is fantastic news, right? He had a pretty rough opening to this primary season, finishing in fourth place, in fifth place. He's - I would say - had a remarkably strong last 72 hours not only with that resounding victory in South Carolina, but then just getting a slew of endorsements. And, really, what we've seen is we've seen the moderate candidates in this race decide that they were going to coalesce around one single alternative to Bernie Sanders, and they decided that that best alternative is Joe Biden. You know, on the other hand, though, Bernie Sanders has run as the anti-establishment figure. And in some ways, not receiving endorsements kind of bolsters his theory of the case, which is that the Democratic establishment is not for him and they have never supported him. And certainly, you know, he's not always been a part of - a longtime member of the Democratic Party. CHANG: Right. So if you're on the Sanders campaign right now, I guess how might you be feeling seeing all these endorsements coming in for Biden? KHALID: I mean, that's a tricky thing to say. Would they have wanted an endorsement from someone like Pete Buttigieg, who Bernie Sanders has really ideologically differed with substantively on the debate stage? You know, both Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg have suggested that Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" vision was just too radical. It was not in sync with what a vast majority of Americans wanted, in their view. And, really, I think if you're the Sanders campaign, you have fought against the establishment. And most of the endorsements that we've seen today, while really good for Joe Biden in terms of, you know, consolidating the traditional Democratic establishment support, you know, someone like Bernie Sanders - I would argue it makes his theory stronger as well. So I really would say, to me, the clarifying vision will be when we actually start counting votes on Super Tuesday, when 14 states will vote. CHANG: Right. And speaking of Super Tuesday, I mean, what do you think the effect will be tomorrow on Super Tuesday and going forward of both Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar not being in this race anymore? KHALID: I mean, look; Joe Biden certainly has much to gain, specifically because we see these two candidates who've dropped out of the race go ahead and line themselves up behind Joe Biden. In fact, Buttigieg tonight here said that he was endorsing Biden and he hopes that his supporters would join him in that. I think what's most interesting, Ailsa, is that when we looked at some of the polls earlier in the week, last week, it looked like Joe Biden was really on the cusp of being viable in some of these states. That means he needed - needs to get 15% in order to accrue any delegates. So with Klobuchar and Buttigieg no longer in the race at all, it seems likely that he'll get at least a moderate boost. And at least that way, he'll be viable and be able to get delegates. And to me, that is the biggest difference - is that, really, we'll likely see many more places where Biden, across the board, is able to recruit delegates tomorrow. CHANG: All right. That is NPR's Asma Khalid. Thank you so much, Asma. KHALID: My pleasure. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "U.S. health officials ramp up the ability to test for coronavirus. The Democratic presidential race may narrow again after Super Tuesday. And, Israel holds a third election in less than a year.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: A second person suffering from COVID-19 in the United States has died. This is the disease caused by coronavirus. Officials in the U.S. are seeing more signs the virus may have been spreading undetected for weeks now, and they are trying to ramp up testing. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The man died in Washington state, where he was a patient in a nursing facility. It appears that many people are sick in that facility, including the first health care worker in the United States known to have contracted the disease. At least two schools have closed in Washington state. And the governor, Jay Inslee, has declared a state of emergency. We should also mention that new cases of the virus have been reported in New York state, Rhode Island and California. GREENE: Let's bring in NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Good morning, Rob. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So an important distinction to make - I mean, we're seeing the numbers tick up now and a second death. But I mean, this could have been an outbreak that is just being detected now. but it could've been happening weeks ago. STEIN: Yeah. You know, until last week, all the coronavirus cases we knew about in the U.S. were either all people who caught it overseas or who caught it from someone known to have caught it overseas. The first case in which someone apparently caught the virus in the U.S. through what we call community spread was reported in California at the end of last week. And right after that, another case like that was found in California along with similar cases in Oregon and Washington state. What's probably really happening is we're finally seeing testing done widely for the first time in this country. Pretty much all the testing for the coronavirus was being funneled through the CDC in Atlanta, but state and local labs finally just got the go-ahead to do their own testing. It's likely that we're just starting to discover cases that have been here for a while and starting to get new ones quicker. And just yesterday, a new analysis came out of the genetics of the virus in Washington state. It suggests that the virus may have been circulating kind of silently in the state for weeks. And hundreds may already be infected and we're just realizing it now. GREENE: I mean, Rob, I got to ask - why the delay? We've known that this virus, I mean, was - the outbreak in China, we've been reporting on it, and also suggestions that it could come to the U.S. Why the delay here? STEIN: Yeah. So there really have been two issues about the testing. One is the first test kits the CDC initially sent to state and local labs, it just didn't work. And the CDC finally fixed that problem, letting states to start to do their own testing. The second problem was that the CDC was using very strict criteria for who could be tested. The agency finally relaxed those criteria. And the CDC says it was restricting testing because of the limited capacity to test, and so there was kind of a need to test only those who are most likely to have this new coronavirus because they had a connection to overseas travel. I talked to Scott Becker about this. He's the executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. SCOTT BECKER: I certainly do wish that the testing was available sooner. There was this very unfortunate challenge in the production process, and it did put us a few weeks behind. STEIN: So the worry is we may have lost a kind of a crucial window to contain the virus and let it kind of get a foothold and spread undetected. So the CDC is taking a lot of heat for this and a lot of questions about why we had this big delay when other countries were testing widely for a long time already. GREENE: So a lot of important questions to ask. But for the moment, I mean, what happens now? I assume a lot more testing. STEIN: Yeah. So testing is finally really ramping up now. Dozens of state and local labs are testing, and about a hundred should be up and running and testing this week. And the Food and Drug Administration is finally letting other places, like hospitals, do their own testing. So it wouldn't be surprising if we start finding infections all over the country. This might not mean that the virus is suddenly spreading a lot faster. It could mean that we're just finding this spread that's been going on for a while without anyone really realizing it. GREENE: NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Rob, thanks so much. STEIN: You bet, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. The Democratic presidential field is shrinking. INSKEEP: Yeah. And one of the candidates, Pete Buttigieg, returned to his home city of South Bend, Ind., to give a speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETE BUTTIGIEG: I will no longer seek to be the 2020 Democratic nominee for president. But I will do everything in my power to ensure that we have a new Democratic president come January. (APPLAUSE) INSKEEP: That was yesterday. Tomorrow is Super Tuesday. Fourteen states hold Democratic presidential primaries. GREENE: And NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow is in one of those states reporting - Utah. And he joins us from Salt Lake City. Hi there, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. GREENE: All right. So we heard a little bit from Mayor Pete. We should say, I mean, he was not just in the race; he was doing pretty well. He technically won Iowa, came in second in New Hampshire. So I mean, what kind of impact could his departure have here? DETROW: Yeah. He bet everything in those states. He succeeded to an extent there that no one would have believed when he entered the race. And he was actually third in the overall delegate race at the time he left. But he was never able to gain momentum anywhere else, particularly in more diverse states like Nevada and South Carolina. There are some signals from Buttigieg and his camp that one big reason he's leaving is to not keep dividing the field in a way that could benefit Bernie Sanders. So you could see an argument that this could really help Joe Biden, particularly in places like California with so many delegates. And there had been a few polls that showed that Biden was right under that important 15% mark, about where you get delegates. But right after this happened, I did talk to Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir, and he made the argument that Buttigieg voters may be more up for grabs. He said, people are far more complicated in their ideology than pundits like to suggest. And surveys on second choice for Buttigieg supporters do show that support going a lot of different ways. Of course, if Buttigieg makes an outright endorsement, that could change things. GREENE: OK. You mentioned that Buttigieg was third in the delegate count. The candidates who are first and second - Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden. Coming out of South Carolina now, heading right into Super Tuesday, what does the race look like? DETROW: Well, Biden in South Carolina provided - showed that he could win, particularly among black voters in that state, which, of course, are such a key demographic coalition for Democrats. More importantly, for Biden, it changed the conversation, changed the narrative. He showed strength, could talk about a comeback. And we have seen things like that really matter after a year of voters obsessing on electability and a lot of signs that, in the first few primaries and caucuses, a lot of voters made up their minds at the very last minute. So both Sanders and Biden are now treating this like a two-person race. Here was Sanders in San Jose yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: Time and again, Joe was on the floor of the Senate fighting for a balanced budget amendment that would have cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans' needs. (BOOING) SANDERS: Now, my point here is not to just be negative about Joe. My point is to ask you all, what campaign is going to defeat Donald Trump? DETROW: And Biden is equally increasingly critical of Sanders. So they are both acting like it's a two-person race. GREENE: I have to ask you one more thing, Scott. It's about something you tweeted last night. I noticed you wrote... DETROW: Yes. GREENE: ...Did Bernie break up Public Enemy during my hour-and-a-half flight? What happened? DETROW: You could kind of argue he did. It's deeply ironic, given his campaign is all about fighting the power. He has been having a lot of performances from music groups. Chuck D performed in LA under the billing of Public Enemy. Flavor Flav was not happy. He sent Sanders a cease-and-desist, which of course made a reference to time in it. So last night, Public Enemy announced they are dropping Flavor Flav and moving forward without him. GREENE: When you cover politics, you really cover everything. NPR's Scott Detrow... DETROW: Oh, yeah. GREENE: Scott, thanks so much. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK. So Israelis are back at the polls today again. This is their third general election in less than a year. INSKEEP: The last two elections ended in stalemates, with neither side able to form a coalition. Once again, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has his political future on the line. After more than a decade in office and facing a corruption trial that's set to begin in two weeks, he's not giving up, wants to keep the job. GREENE: And NPR's Daniel Estrin is at a polling site. Hi, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, there. GREENE: So third time voting in less than a year - can you remind us why we are here? ESTRIN: We are here because Israel's political system is in deep crisis, David. Two big reasons for that - first, there is an inherent weakness in the way elections work here. Neither Benjamin Netanyahu nor his rival, Benny Gantz, have been able to build a majority coalition in Parliament. And the system does not force a decisive winner. The other reason for the deadlock is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He faces corruption charges. A lot of his political allies are no longer willing to join his government and stand by his side, and he keeps trying and trying. GREENE: So what are voters telling you? I mean, are they saying that they're just sick of voting in general? Or are they hanging in there and want to do this until they get a result? ESTRIN: It's amazing. You'd think repeated elections would bring fewer people to the polls. But voter turnout actually increased a bit from the first round to the second round last year. And I'm feeling the same energy this year. Voters realize, though, that, you know, something is wrong about holding election after election. I want to play you a clip from voter Savi Shapiro (ph). SAVI SHAPIRO: There's something called shitat matzliach. It's success method where it doesn't really matter how you achieve success as long as you achieve success. ESTRIN: And basically, he's saying he thinks there aren't any rules anymore. You just hold election after election to try to win. He blames Netanyahu for doing that. And I want to play you another clip of what a hairstylist told me. His name is Itzik Latati (ph). He is still undecided. And he, I think, sums up the spirit of where a lot of Israeli voters are. ITZIK LATATI: I love Benjamin Netanyahu. I feel in the body Benjamin Netanyahu. While I think in the - for my... ESTRIN: Your head. LATATI: ...Head, Benny Gantz. In my body - in the inside, Benjamin Netanyahu. ESTRIN: So his body is saying... GREENE: Wow. ESTRIN: ...Netanyahu. His head is saying Gantz. And the country really is split. GREENE: Some voters doing some soul-searching it, sounds like. Any indication that results will be different on this third try? ESTRIN: Quite frankly, they may not be. Voters have not really changed their minds. We could see another stalemate, maybe even a fourth election. There are some factors, though, that could tip the scales here. First of all, voter turnout will be key. Netanyahu has a major operation to get his voters out to the polls. Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel are voting, and they may have a strong voter turnout. They're mostly focused on booting out Netanyahu. And finally, David, coronavirus. There are fears that there are fake news rumors that could be going around about virus outbreaks that could suppress voter turnout. GREENE: Wow. All right. NPR's Daniel Estrin covering the third general election in Israel in less than a year. Daniel, thanks so much. ESTRIN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Updated at 10 p.m. ET Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old who rose from mayor of a midsize Indiana city to a serious presidential contender, officially suspended his campaign on Sunday evening. \"The truth is that the path has narrowed to a close,\" Buttigieg told a crowd in his hometown of South Bend, Ind., after an introduction by his husband, Chasten. \"We have a responsibility to consider the effect of remaining in this race any further.\" An openly gay Navy Reserve veteran, Buttigieg departs the Democratic race third in overall delegates, behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. On Sunday night, Buttigieg thanked supporters for the campaign they helped build and said that effort to usher in a new generation of politics will continue. \"I firmly believe that in these years, in our time, we can and we will make American life and politics more like what it could be \u2014 not just more wise and more prosperous, but more equitable and more just and more decent,\" he said, as supporters cheered and chanted \"BOOT-EDGE-EGE.\" Before Buttigieg took the stage, his husband, Chasten, gave an emotional speech, emphasizing the historic weight of the campaign and the significance of the first openly gay candidate to make a serious run at a major party's nomination for president. His voice wavered at several points, and he paused to wipe tears. \"Life gave me some interesting experiences on my way to find Pete,\" he said. \"After falling in love with Pete, Pete got me to believe in myself again. And I told Pete to run because I knew there were other kids sitting out there in this country who needed to believe in themselves, too.\" Buttigieg recognized that significance, too. \"We sent a message to every kid out there, wondering if whatever marks them out as different means they are somehow destined to be less than, to see that someone who once felt that exact same way can become a leading presidential candidate with his husband at his side,\" he said. The announcement came a day after Buttigieg finished fourth in South Carolina's Democratic primary, the party's fourth nominating contest. Buttigieg had finished in a virtual tie in Iowa's caucuses, then second in New Hampshire and third in Nevada. Iowa and New Hampshire are predominantly white states, but Buttigieg struggled to attract support in the more diverse states of Nevada and South Carolina. According to exit polls, he earned the backing of just 3% of African American voters in South Carolina; black voters made up a majority of the Democratic electorate in Saturday's primary. Buttigieg spent the final day of his campaign meeting with former President Jimmy Carter in Georgia, and then marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., an annual commemoration of Bloody Sunday. He said walking in the shadow of civil rights giants had him thinking about how the nation might now try to live up to their example. Buttigieg's departure could help boost Biden, who has been competing for some of the same moderate voters and is trying to catch up to Sanders' delegate lead on Super Tuesday. The Sanders campaign is pushing back on the idea that the shake-up hurts Sanders more than anyone else. \"His supporters are going to be more up for grabs,\" Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told NPR. \"I think people are far more complicated in their ideology than pundits like to suggest.\" Buttigieg made the announcement at the Century Center in South Bend, the venue where he held a launch event for his book last February before jumping into the race. Back then, there was no national press \u2014 mostly local South Bend television affiliates. A year later, Buttigieg outlasted most of a crowded Democratic field and often drew rally crowds that topped 1,000. On Sunday night, the former mayor joked about his relative anonymity when he decided to run last year: \"Hardly anybody knew my name, and even fewer could pronounce it. First name Mayor, last name Pete.\" A graduate of Harvard and Oxford and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Buttigieg spent eight years in office in South Bend and gained national recognition in 2017 during an unsuccessful bid to serve as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. When he first announced his candidacy for president last year, Buttigieg was perceived as a little-known long shot focused on what he calls \"intergenerational justice,\" but he quickly emerged among the front-runners in the crowded Democratic field with his moderate, future-focused message. An adept debater, Buttigieg often clashed onstage with Sanders and fellow progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., criticizing their sweeping \"Medicare for All\" health care proposals. Buttigieg also warned that Sanders' self-avowed democratic socialism would harm down-ballot Democrats. But Buttigieg was dogged by questions about his handling of high-profile racial incidents involving the police during his tenure as mayor. He also faced scrutiny over his brief tenure at the consulting firm McKinsey, prompting the release of a list of nine of his former clients. And fellow candidates pressured him to open his fundraisers to reporters and provide more information about the people raising money for his presidential campaign. But before that, speaking to NPR's Steve Inskeep in January 2019, he said he understood his campaign was an \"underdog project.\" \"But I also don't think that you should ever run for any office that you do not seek to win,\" he said. In a statement Sunday night, Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David said the former South Bend mayor's candidacy made history. \"Mayor Buttigieg ran an incredible campaign that broke glass ceilings and inspired countless LGBTQ people to run for office and enter public service,\" he wrote. \"His history-making, open and honest campaign gave representation to a community that has been for long far too long pushed out of the spotlight. He gave a voice to millions across the country, to issues often ignored.\" Buttigieg's departure will leave six candidates in the race, after billionaire Tom Steyer ended his bid on Saturday night. The youngest male candidate is now 77-year-old Joe Biden. With additional reporting by NPR's Asma Khalid and Scott Detrow",

Even now, with two early state wins and one virtual tie under its belt, and a chance to pull away from the rest of the presidential primary field on Super Tuesday, the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has a bit of a chip on its shoulder about the way it says it's covered by the media. \"There's begrudging acceptance of the campaign, is the way I'd put it,\" campaign manager Faiz Shakir told NPR at a crowded Las Vegas rally on the eve of the Nevada caucuses, which Sanders would go on to win by a landslide. \"Part of that is because it's an anti-establishment campaign. And for some people in the quote, unquote establishment, it feels like a personal affront to them.\" Running against the media is a time-honored political tradition, stretching from President Trump back to President Harry Truman and beyond. But as they plotted a second White House run early last year, Sanders' inner circle decided to do something more with their deep skepticism of the media: They decided to effectively create their own online video network to cover their candidate. Beginning with Sanders' kickoff rally in Brooklyn last spring, the campaign has streamed every rally. And it's created in-house shows starring top staffers. And while other campaigns \u2014 like those of former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker \u2014 have dabbled in streaming behind-the-scenes moments, the Sanders campaign has made its livestreaming efforts a central part of its overall messaging, fundraising and organizing strategy. Livestream videographers Chris Witschy and Aidan Barringer are always among the pocketful of staffers traveling on the same charter plane as Sanders, and always get the prime real estate at the center of the press riser at rallies. Sanders pays close attention, and often asks what the livestream numbers look like shortly after his rallies end. The numbers are really big: more than 85 million views over the course of the campaign, spread across traditional social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube, and newer, more niche platforms like the gaming network Twitch. When Sanders crisscrossed the country over Presidents' Day weekend, his campaign noted that while he drew a total of 50,000 supporters to rallies in six states, he also pulled in more than 4 million livestream views. \"Let's just do it on our own\" For all of its digital focus, livestreaming was not a big part of the 2016 Sanders presidential campaign. Sanders began experimenting with the format in January 2018, when he pitched TV networks on the idea of a town hall focused on his signature issue, \"Medicare for All.\" Josh Miller-Lewis, at the time Sanders' Senate communications director and now the campaign's creative director, said Sanders pitched a TV network on the idea, but wouldn't say which one. \"They said, 'Oh, we'll talk about it,' and of course never got back to us. And so [Sanders] said, 'You know what, let's just do it on our own. Let's livestream a town hall, Medicare for All. We'll bring in experts and we'll talk about what Medicare for All means, and we'll talk to the American people about it.' \" More than 1 million people streamed the forum, a number that stuck in the minds of Sanders and his advisers. They did more town halls on climate change and other topics, and as the focus turned to a second presidential run, they decided to make livestreaming a central component of the campaign. Sanders advisers all remembered what some online supporters often angrily referred to as the \"Bernie Media Blackout\": how it took until late 2015 for most major news outlets to treat Sanders as a contender, and not a gadfly. Beyond that, they all shared a view that Sanders regularly addresses during his stump speeches: \"the skepticism,\" as Miller-Lewis put it, \"that the media would cover the issues that Bernie cares about, that he's talking about every single day, and that the American people care about.\" In addition to broadcasting rallies, the campaign created roundtable shows featuring staffers and volunteers, as well as produced videos and occasional town halls. Eyeballs tracked the campaign's overall upward trajectory. For most of 2019, streams hovered around 2 million a month. But once Sanders began gaining momentum, when New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him after his heart attack, the average views began to climb \u2014 6 million in November, 10 million in December, 12 million in January, according to data provided by the Sanders campaign. \"More opportunity for people to feel like they're not alone\" All the while, video director Mia Fermindoza was sitting in a control room in Washington, D.C., experimenting with ways to increase viewing times and engagement. Fermindoza joined the Sanders campaign from NowThis News, an online platform that's well known for its viral progressive videos. While directing the livestream, Fermindoza would look at the camera angles coming in from the two videographers the campaign sends to every rally. But she was more focused on what she and Miller-Lewis see as the heart of the livestream: the comments it features from viewers.

A conversation is always running along the righthand side of the stream. And with graphics that mirror cable news coverage, the campaign urges supporters to volunteer and contribute. At the bottom of the screen, a stock ticker-like chyron displays the names of people who comment or donate. \"We want to be putting out comments from people that are getting excited about donating,\" Fermindoza explained. \"Like, 'Oh, next time Bernie does this, I'm throwing in 100 bucks, who wants to be top donor with me?' This is a very gaming, Twitch-style, and we find that people want that.\" The money the livestream raises is ultimately \"negligible\" in the grand scheme of the Sanders campaign budget, according to Shakir, the campaign manager \u2014 $55,000 the night Sanders won Nevada, $85,000 when the campaign streamed a Strokes concert the night before the New Hampshire primary. \"It ends up covering the cost, quite frankly, of us being in these kinds of platforms, investing in the technology we need to livestream these events, and send staffers around the country to cover him,\" Shakir said. But Fermindoza argues the conversation around soliciting and trumpeting donations is far more important than the actual dollars, and gives supporters more ownership of the campaign. \"You know, how does that make you feel? How does that make you feel to see your comment up there, getting other people excited?\" she said. \"All we're doing is producing more opportunity for people to feel like they're not alone.\" An internet-fueled rise That mindset makes sense to Daniel Kreiss, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina's Hussman School of Media and Journalism who has written two books about digital organizing on presidential campaigns. He said it all fits with the Sanders campaign mantra of, 'not me, us.' \"And to the extent that they look to make that physical to other supporters, I think it creates that sense of collective identity \u2014 that these are Sanders people, this is the movement,\" Kreiss said. \"These are the people who are powering the Sanders campaign.\" Kreiss is skeptical a campaign livestream could fully replace traditional media coverage, but he doesn't see any other campaign rivaling Sanders' efforts on that front. He views the livestream as the latest evidence of how the internet has fueled Sanders' rise to front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Kreiss argues the main thing the internet has done for presidential campaigns is lower the bar for outsiders like Sanders and Trump, making it easier for them to amplify their message and raise money. Kreiss says one difference between the two was Trump's ability to set the campaign agenda every single day. \"I don't think Sanders has ever had that absolute dominance over the public sphere,\" he said. \"But he has used the internet in really powerful ways to translate attention and enthusiasm into electoral resources that have fueled his two bids.\" And while the livestream won't fully replace mainstream news outlets any time soon, it's another way to force a campaign narrative that simply wasn't available just a couple of presidential campaigns ago.",

As Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary debate came to a close, each of the candidates was asked to name the biggest misconception voters have about them. A day later, the question was still on the mind of Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge fund investor who has barnstormed South Carolina, aggressively courting the black vote with a focus on racial justice and climate issues. \"I know that people describe me as being a rich person,\" Steyer told the group gathered in the fellowship hall of Georgetown, S.C.'s Bethel AME. \"We're in church. I'm not defined by money. That is not how I think about myself. I'm from a family that has never thought that way about life.\" Whether Steyer sees himself that way or not, his spending has prompted a stir in South Carolina as he seeks a foothold here. He has poured money into the black community, in the form of supporting black businesses, vendors and the ads that have inundated this state. That focus was on display in Georgetown. As people trickled in out of the rain, some picked up shirts that Steyer's campaign is giving out. One said \"Reparations are Past Due,\" another \"Invest in HBCUs.\" A volunteer handed out church fans with photos of Steyer surrounded by black South Carolinians. At one point, there was a throwback to the refrain of the Obama years, but instead of \"fired up\" and \"ready to go,\" people chanted \"Steyered up,\" and \"Trump's gotta go.\" Jack Scoville, a retired lawyer and the former mayor of Georgetown, was in the front row. He was leaning toward supporting Biden, who was campaigning in Georgetown, about a mile away. \"Well frankly, I hadn't been very impressed with Mr. Steyer. I don't like the fact that these guys come in because they've got a lot of money and think they can run the country,\" Scoville said. Supporters sit in the overflow room as Democratic presidential hopeful Tom Steyer speaks during a town hall meeting in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters sit in the overflow room as Democratic presidential hopeful Tom Steyer speaks during a town hall meeting in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Wednesday. Scoville prefers someone with a more traditional background, but he said he was willing to be convinced. Sitting next to him was Mack Nesmith of Georgetown, who is also retired and also undecided. \"I'm in a dilemma right now between Steyer, Vice President Biden and Elizabeth Warren, it's between those three,\"  Nesmith said. Nesmith said he wanted to learn about Steyer's positions on Medicare, Social Security and what his plans are for America's senior citizens. One thing that everyone here mentioned was the ads that Steyer has been running in the state. They're impossible to miss. Since July when Steyer jumped into the race \u2014 after initially demurring \u2014 he has spent more than $17 million on local television ads. And then there are the mailers. Nesmith said he got more from Steyer than anyone else. Sitting on the other side of the room, Marvin Neal, who is the head of Georgetown's NAACP, said he got three or four each week. They're so ubiquitous that a voter at Steyer's CNN town hall this week asked Steyer, the founder of NextGen America and a longtime climate change champion, how the strategy was environmentally responsible. Steyer has staked his campaign on South Carolina, and there are signs that his strategy \u2014 which leans heavily on courting the black vote \u2014 has helped his candidacy. A Monmouth University poll on Thursday showed that he has support of 15% of Democratic primary voters, in third place behind Biden with 36% and Bernie Sanders with 16%. No other candidate is in the double digits, or nearing the 15% threshold to earn statewide delegates. Steyer did not net a single delegate in Iowa, New Hampshire or Nevada, so while South Carolina is regarded as a firewall for Biden, it could be a last stand for Steyer too. Like Biden, his campaign's theory of the case is that victory in South Carolina would act as a launchpad ahead of Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 other states vote. But polls in many of those states, where they do exist, show little good news for Steyer. But here in South Carolina, it's not hard to find voters who have met him three or four times. At a breakfast town hall focused on rural health care in Orangeburg, Rosella and Michael Cooper said that Steyer had been to Denmark, where they live, over and over again. Residents have raised questions about the water system there, and Steyer often talks about his trips when he's campaigning, here or elsewhere. \"Come to Denmark, which is such a small, small town, and it's a poor town, and then they have our interest,\" said Michael Cooper. \"But when you come back as many times as he has, now you have our support.\" As people wound through the line for a breakfast buffet provided by Steyer's campaign, Rosella Cooper told me she'd been volunteering for Steyer all week. While some have criticized Steyer, and fellow billionaire Michael Bloomberg, for self-funding their own campaigns, it didn't bother the Coopers. They saw the fact that Steyer was not seeking donations as a good thing. Tatanshia Palmer also attended the Orangeburg breakfast. \"I was originally planning on supporting Joe Biden because he was familiar,\" said Palmer. \"I figured if Barack Obama could trust him, I could trust him as well.\" But she saw Steyer's ads, and learned more about him, and ultimately decided to give him her support. I think Steyer is a billionaire with a heart and a message that is resonating with people. Gilda Cobb-Hunter Steyer's also picked up the support of some influential South Carolina lawmakers, including Gilda Cobb-Hunter, the longest-serving member of the South Carolina House, and an influential African American leader in the state. She is a paid national adviser to Steyer's campaign, a move that drew some scrutiny when first reported by The Associated Press. Cobb-Hunter pushed back against some of the skepticism around Steyer's spending and concern that he is buying the state's black vote. \"It's not just about money. It's about message. You can have all the money in the world, but if you ain't saying nothing, then what does it really matter,\" she said at an interview at her Columbia office. \"I think Steyer is a billionaire with a heart and a message that is resonating with people.\" She also suggested that Biden's grip on the state's black vote was not as strong as polls make it seem.

She said Biden's success should be judged not by whether he wins her state, but by what margin. Though Biden leads in the polls here, Steyer rarely mentions him on the trail. Instead, he describes a race for first place between Sanders and Bloomberg, neither of which he says are really Democrats. \"Actually nominating one of the people from the extremes of the party risks the party turnout,\" Steyer said this week. \"And that's what I've been trying to say about Bernie and Mike Bloomberg.\" He says he's a progressive Democrat, the kind with the solutions that voters are looking for. They just have to give him a chance. \"That's why South Carolina matters so much. I have to show in real time with real people that they are voting for me and I can be the person to pull the party together,\" he said. \"That's what has to happen, and that's what I'm asking you to help me do.\"",

In 2019, those insurers spent what it took to defeat Connecticut's version of a \"public option\" in health care, despite strong support among the state's lawmakers. Health care costs were rising. People couldn't afford coverage. So, in Connecticut, state lawmakers took action. Their solution was to attempt to create a public health insurance option, managed by the state, which would ostensibly serve as a low-cost alternative for people who couldn't afford private plans. Immediately, an aggressive industry mobilized to kill the idea. Despite months of lobbying, debate and organizing, the proposal was dead on arrival. \"That bill was met with a steam train of opposition,\" recalls state Rep. Sean Scanlon, who chairs the legislature's insurance and real estate committee. Through a string of presidential debates, the idea of a public option has been championed by moderate Democrats \u2015 such as former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden \u2015 as an alternative to a single-payer \"Medicare for All\" model. Those center-left candidates again touted the idea during Tuesday's Democratic debate in South Carolina, with Buttigieg arguing such an approach would deliver universal care without the political baggage. The public option has a common-sense appeal for many Americans who list health care costs as a top political concern: If the market doesn't offer patients an affordable health care insurance they like, why not give them the option to buy into a government-run health plan? But the stunning 2019 defeat of a plan to implement such a policy in Connecticut \u2014 a solidly blue, or liberal-leaning, state \u2014 shows how difficult it may be to enact even \"moderate\" solutions that threaten some of America's most powerful and lucrative industries. The health insurance industry's fear: If the average American could weigh a public option \u2014 Medicare or Medicaid or some amalgam of the two \u2014 against commercial plans on the market, they might find the latter wanting. That fear has long blocked political action, says Colleen Grogan, a professor at the University of Chicago's School of Social Service Administration, because \"insurance companies are at the table\" when health care reform legislation gets proposed. To be sure, the state calculus is different from what a federal one would be. In the statehouse, a single industry can have an outsize influence and legislators are more skittish about job loss. In Connecticut, insurers were an especially potent force. Cigna and Aetna are among the state's top 10 employers. \"They became aware of the bill, and they moved immediately to kill it,\" says Frances Padilla, who heads the Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut and worked to generate support for the public option. And those strategies have been replicated at the national level as a national coalition of health industry players ramps up lobbying against Democratic proposals. Beyond insurance, health care systems and hospitals have joined in mobilizing against both public option and single-payer proposals, for fear a government-backed plan would pay far less than the rates of commercial insurance. Many states are exploring implementing a public option, and once one is successful, others may well follow, opening the door to a federal program. \"State action is always a precursor for federal action,\" says Trish Riley, the executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. \"There's a long history of that.\" Those state efforts continue, all around the U.S. Virginia state delegate Ibraheem Samirah introduced a new public option bill this session. In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis is spearheading an effort. And Washington state is the furthest along \u2014 it approved a public option last year, and the state-offered plan will be available next year. But in 2019, Connecticut's legislators were stuck between two diametrically opposed constituencies, both distinctly local. Health costs had skyrocketed. Across the state, Scanlon says, small-business owners worried that the high price of insurance was squeezing their margins. A state-provided health plan, the logic went, would be highly regulated and offer lower premiums and stable benefits, providing a viable, affordable alternative to businesses and individuals. (It could also pressure private insurance to offer cheaper plans.) A coalition of state legislators came together around a proposal: Let small businesses and individuals buy into the state employee health benefit plan. Insurers' response was swift. Lobbyists from the insurance industry swarmed the Capitol, recalled Kevin Lembo, the state comptroller. \"There was a lot of pressure put on the legislature and governor's office not to do this.\" State ethics filings make it impossible to tease out how much of Aetna and Cigna's lobbying money was spent specifically to defeat the public option legislation. In the 2019-20 period, Aetna spent almost $158,000 in total lobbying: $93,000 lobbying the Statehouse, and $65,000 on the governor's office. Cigna spent about $157,000: $84,000 went to the legislature, and $73,000 to the executive branch. Anthem, another large insurance company, spent almost $147,000 on lobbying during that same period \u2014 $23,545 to the governor, and $123,045 to the legislature. Padilla recalls that Anthem also made its opposition clear, though it was less vocal than the other companies. (Anthem did not respond to our requests for comment.) A coalition of insurance companies and business trade groups rolled out an online campaign, commissioning reports and promoting op-eds that argued the state proposal would devastate the local economy. Lawmakers also received scores of similarly worded emails from Cigna and Aetna employees, voicing concern that a public option would eliminate their jobs, according to documents shared with Kaiser Health News. Cigna declined to comment on those emails, and Aetna never responded to requests for comment. Connecticut's first public option bill \u2014 which would let people directly buy into the publicly run state employee health plan \u2015 flamed out. So lawmakers put forth a compromise proposal: The state would contract with private plans to administer the government health option, allowing insurance companies to participate in the system. The night before voting, that too fell apart. Accounts of what happened vary. Some say Cigna threatened to pull its business out of the state if a public option were implemented. Publicly, Cigna has said it never issued such a threat, but made clear that a public option would harm its bottom line. The company would not elaborate when contacted by KHN. Now, months later, both Scanlon and Lembo say another attempt is in the works, pegged to legislation resembling last year's compromise bill. But state lawmakers work only from February through early May, which is not a lot of time to put a major bill together. Meanwhile, other states are making similar pushes, fighting their own uphill battles. \"It really depends on whether there are other countervailing pressures in the state that allow politicians to be able to go for a public option,\" Grogan says. And, nationally, if a public option appears to gain national traction, Blendon says, insurance companies \"are clearly going to battle.\" They're going to go after every Republican, every moderate Democrat, to try to say that,\" he says. \"It's a backdoor way to have the government take over insurance.\" Still, when President Barack Obama first proposed the idea of a public option as part of the Affordable Care Act, it was put aside as too radical. Less than a decade later, support for the idea is stronger than it ever has been \u2015 every Democratic candidate backs either an optional public health plan or Medicare for All. Support is so strong, Grogan says, that it is hard for people to understand \"the true extent\" of the resistance that must be overcome to realize such a plan. But in Connecticut, politicians say they're up for a new battle in 2020. \"We can't accept the status quo,\" Scanlon says. \"People are literally dying and going bankrupt.

Bernie Sanders, with his wife, Jane Sanders, waves as they exit the stage at a campaign rally Saturday in San Antonio. The 2020 Democratic nomination is now Sen. Bernie Sanders' to lose. The independent from Vermont \u2060\u2014 who is running as a Democrat and often speaks about the ills not just of Republicans, but also of Democrats \u2060\u2014 handily won the Nevada Democratic caucuses. And he did it by broadening his coalition beyond his base of young voters and progressives. Sanders won the popular vote in Iowa, the New Hampshire primary and now the Nevada caucuses. The man who calls himself a democratic socialist and has been seemingly running as an outsider all his life is now the inside man. More on Sanders and the other candidates in these six takeaways: 1. Sanders expands his base. One of the major question marks for Sanders coming into Nevada was whether he could win with more than just his core base, which fueled his winning a quarter of the vote in Iowa and New Hampshire. Well, on Saturday, he did that. Sanders won not only with voters under 30 and people who identify as very liberal, but also with men, women, Hispanics (overwhelmingly), voters 45 to 64 and people with and without college degrees, according to polls conducted as voters entered caucus sites. He also did well among black voters and moderates, finishing a close second to Joe Biden with both groups, which are supposed to be the former vice president's base. \"In Nevada,\" Sanders said, \"we have just put together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition that is not only going to win in Nevada \u2014 it's going to sweep this country.\" Now it's on to South Carolina, where Sanders has been polling second to Biden, and then it's Super Tuesday, March 3. Sanders made a show of confidence Saturday by leaving Nevada and going to Texas, one of the biggest prizes on Super Tuesday. He also traveled the day before to California, the largest state voting on March 3. 2. Biden lives to fight another day. Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a caucus night event Saturday in Las Vegas.\n                \n                    \n                    John Locher/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a caucus night event Saturday in Las Vegas. That day is next Saturday, Feb. 29, in South Carolina. Biden finished a distant second in Nevada. He said after Iowa and New Hampshire that once the electorate became more diverse, he would do better. He won black voters in Nevada \u2060\u2014 but only narrowly over Sanders. Biden and the rest of the field were walloped by Sanders among Latinos. Still, Biden was confident he would recover. \"We're alive, we're coming back and we're going to win!\" Biden declared. But it's Biden whose coalition is looking increasingly narrow, not Sanders'. South Carolina's Democratic electorate was 61% black in 2016. Biden predicted he would win there and then propel into the Super Tuesday contests. He had better win in South Carolina, or there doesn't look like much of a path to Super Tuesday that includes him winning the nomination, especially with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg looming. Bloomberg threatens to siphon centrist votes from Biden on Super Tuesday. Biden could have his hands full in South Carolina. Not only is Sanders on his heels with African American voters, but wealthy venture capitalist Tom Steyer has spent more than $20 million on ads in that state, and he is targeting black voters too. 3. The moderates gambled \u2014 and are losing \u2014 on opposing \"Medicare for All.\" At a caucus night event Saturday in Las Vegas, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg warns against rushing to nominate Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n                \n                    \n                    Patrick Semansky/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption At a caucus night event Saturday in Las Vegas, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg warns against rushing to nominate Sen. Bernie Sanders. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who finished third in Nevada, said something Saturday that moderates should take note of. It came immediately after accusing Sanders of believing in \"an inflexible ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans.\" He said: I believe we can defeat [President] Trump and deliver for the American people by empowering the American people to make their own health care choices with 'Medicare for All Who Want It.' Senator Sanders believes in taking away that choice, removing people from having the option of a private plan and replacing it with a public plan, whether you want it or not. The problem with that is, while most Americans overall oppose Medicare for All, you know who likes it? Democrats. In the three states that have held Democratic contests so far, ditching private health insurance for a government plan was backed by 57% in Iowa, 58% in New Hampshire and 62% in Nevada. That's similar to the results from an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll from December that showed 64% of Democrats supporting it. Candidates like Buttigieg, Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have tried to make their opposition to Medicare for All an electability argument. But two-thirds of voters in the Nevada Democratic caucuses said it was more important to nominate someone who could defeat President Trump than to agree with the nominee on major issues, so it was unclear who that person should be. Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg were all close on that question. (Yes, Sanders supporters see him as the most electable; many of them think he would have beaten Trump in 2016 too.) But when it came to those who said agreeing on major issues was most important, the winner was clear: Sanders. He got 54% of those voters. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was next, with just 12%. 4. Expect a forceful Warren at Tuesday's debate. Sen. Elizabeth Warren makes a fist during a campaign event in Seattle. Washington state holds its nominating contest March 10, a week after Super Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Elaine Thompson/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Elizabeth Warren makes a fist during a campaign event in Seattle. Washington state holds its nominating contest March 10, a week after Super Tuesday. Warren didn't come close in Nevada. She's struggling to find her lane between the progressives who find her second best to Sanders and the white college graduates she's battling for with Buttigieg. But one thing that shouldn't go unnoticed is that she finished strong among those who made up their minds in the last few days. Warren got about 20% of them, about the same as Sanders and Buttigieg. Warren did far worse with those who decided earlier. What does that tell you? She and her surrogates believe that this shows Warren had a strong debate \u2014 and that she was hurt by early voting. Because so many people voted early, before her strong performance against Bloomberg, it was nearly impossible for Warren to change enough minds to be a factor. The lesson for Warren is likely to be that she can differentiate herself from Sanders in Tuesday's South Carolina debate with a similar command posture. She may have the money to continue on to Super Tuesday, but Warren and her team are going to have to seriously evaluate if there's a real path to the nomination, especially if she doesn't have a strong finish in South Carolina. 5. Republicans were thrilled with the result \u2014 and lack of (fast) results. Trump was happy to continue trying to cause trouble in the Democratic race. He called Sanders \"crazy\" and mocked other candidates, while also encouraging Sanders to not \"let them take it away from you\" \u2014 all with fewer than 280 characters. Looks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada. Biden & the rest look weak, & no way Mini Mike can restart his campaign after the worst debate performance in the history of Presidential Debates. Congratulations Bernie, & don\u2019t let them take it away from you! Republicans are gleeful about the idea of being able to run against Sanders and \"socialism.\" Trump's campaign went after that idea \u2014 and the slow results of the caucuses. \"Media reports of unstaffed caucus sites in Nevada just prove that the national Democrat Party is in chaos and incompetent,\" Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, said in a statement. \"Even with that mess, there is no denying that Big Government Socialism dominated again as Bernie Sanders remained the leader of the leftist pack. We are another day closer to Election Day and another day closer to re-electing President Trump.\" The Trump campaign is happy to try to sow chaos and seeds of doubt in the Democratic primary \u2014 and there's no easier way to do that than by playing to preconceived suspicions about the Democratic Party held by many of Sanders' supporters. 6. Caucuses may very well be doomed. It can be frustrating to watch election results come in so slowly. By midnight ET, just over a quarter of the vote had been released. Given Sanders' big lead in the entrance polls, networks and The Associated Press were able to call the race for him with just a slim percentage of the vote in. The party wanted to get it right and avoid the debacle in Iowa. Election security experts say accuracy should not be sacrificed for speed as going slow and making sure all the quality controls have been completed are the most important things. But it's pretty clear that things go more quickly \u2014 without sacrificing accuracy \u2014 in primaries. They also have fewer accessibility issues. Increasingly, states have been moving toward primaries and leaving caucus systems behind. Expect that to speed up before 2024.",

Bernie Sanders now has victories in two of the first three states to weigh in on the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Updated at 8:48 p.m. ET Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has won the Nevada caucuses, according to an Associated Press projection. The win gives Sanders victories in two of the first three states to weigh in on the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. His other win was in New Hampshire, and he also ended in a near-tie atop the still-muddled Iowa caucuses. Loading... \"In Nevada, we have just put together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition, which is going to not only win in Nevada, it's going to sweep this country,\" Sanders boasted at a rally in San Antonio, Texas, shortly after news outlets reported his caucus win. Sanders now has the clear momentum, and an inside edge among the crowded field of candidates, going into a critical stretch where the bulk of delegates will be awarded. It's a remarkable position for a longtime political outsider who still has not officially joined the Democratic Party. At a different campaign event in Texas earlier in the day, Sanders made a point to respond to critics of the central policy proposal driving his candidacy \u2014 \"Medicare for All.\" \"The idea of universal health care is not a radical idea!\" Sanders insisted. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., congratulated Sanders on his win on Saturday but warned Democrats at an event in Las Vegas about what Sanders' candidacy could mean for the party's prospects in congressional races. \"The only way to truly deliver any of the progressive changes we care about is to be a nominee who actually gives a damn about the effect you are having from the top of the ticket\" on House and Senate candidates who can enact policy changes on health care and immigration, he said. Buttigieg finished second to Sanders in the New Hampshire primary and virtually tied him in Iowa, where the caucus results are still not final. \"We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory. We can either call people names online or we can call them into our movement. We can either tighten a narrow and hardcore base or open the tent to a new, broad, big-hearted American coalition,\" Buttigieg argued. While Sanders will head to events in South Carolina, which holds its primary next Saturday, his campaign is more focused on Super Tuesday (March 3), as evidenced by the fact that Sanders spent more time campaigning in California and Texas than in Nevada in recent days. The campaign is betting that the momentum earned by its sustained stretch of early victories, combined with its massive financial war chest funded by small-dollar donations, will give Sanders the edge on a day when about a third of all delegates will be awarded. Former Vice President Joe Biden, speaking to supporters in Nevada before Sanders was projected as the winner Saturday evening, proclaimed he still had time to shake up the primary race with a win in the next contest. Early results showed him running a distant second to Sanders. \"The press is ready to declare people dead quickly, but we're alive and we're coming back and we're going to win,\" Biden said, adding, \"We're going to win in South Carolina. Then Super Tuesday, and we are on our way.\" Nina Turner, Sanders' national co-chair, told NPR that the campaign wasn't ceding the next primary to any other candidate. \"We're running in South Carolina to win,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic presidential primary hits a new phase on Saturday in Nevada \u2014 a state with a more diverse electorate. Campaigns are reaching out to Latino voters to turn out.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Democrats in Nevada are heading to caucus sites across the state to pick the candidate they want to run against President Trump in November. This year, there is early caucus voting in the state. And the Democrats already claim the turnout is on a track to surpass the numbers of the 2016 contests. Roughly 75,000 people have already cast ballots. NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us. Mara, what an unexpected pleasure. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Yes, what an unexpected pleasure. Hi, Scott. SIMON: Thanks so much for being with us. LIASSON: (Laughter). SIMON: Any indications that the number of voters who already caucused are signaling enthusiasm for any candidate in particular? LIASSON: Well, that is hard to tell. The polls have shown that Bernie Sanders has a pretty clear lead in Nevada. But what's always tricky about drawing any conclusions from early voting is that, are these people voters who would already - would have caucused anyway? Or are these additional new people who are coming out over and above the number that would come out on Saturday? We don't know. Sometimes, early voting just banks your vote early, doesn't increase the total overall. there's certainly been a lot of effort to get voters to turn out. There are indications that a lot of the people who are casting their ballots early are new voters, but we really won't know the answer to that until after the votes are counted. SIMON: So many people have noted Nevada has a much more diverse population than Iowa and New Hampshire. What issues do voters there care about, according to surveys? LIASSON: Well, the No. 1, 2, and 3 issue is beating Donald Trump. That's true of Democrats all over the country. But health care coverage has been the other big issue here because the Culinary Workers Union, one of the most powerful political organizations in the state, has health care that they got after they went on strike and negotiated and gave up wage hikes and bargained for. And what they're worried about, some of them, are that Bernie Sanders' plan, which is mandatory \"Medicare for All\" - in other words, no more private health insurance - everyone automatically, whether they want it or not, goes on Medicare. And they're concerned that that would do away with their what they call culinary health care. The other candidates also want Medicare for All, but it's Medicare for all who want it. It's voluntary. If you want to sign up for Medicare under their plans, you choose the public option, and you get it. So that's been the big debate here. And, of course, Bernie Sanders traditionally has enjoyed very high support among union members, but his supporters have been extremely aggressive. Some of the union officials say they have been - gone over the line. They've gotten death threats from Sanders supporters around this issue of health care. But I would say that's - beyond beating Donald Trump, health care coverage is the big one. SIMON: In the half minute we have left, Nevada's a caucus state, like Iowa. Any concerns about the technology they're using to register the results of the caucus? LIASSON: Absolutely, there are concerns. But they are not using the same app that was used in Iowa. They say they have backup systems. And they say they have staffers on hand to field calls if precincts choose to phone in. Remember in Iowa, people tried to call in the results, and nobody was answering the phone. SIMON: NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson, always a pleasure. Thanks so much.

Her surprise finish on Tuesday, beating out Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, has injected new hope into her presidential campaign. Updated at 3:22 p.m. ET After a fifth-place finish in Iowa, Amy Klobuchar's head-turning performance in New Hampshire on Tuesday night has some calling the Minnesota senator \"the comeback kid.\" Klobuchar captured nearly 20% of the vote, placing her third behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. To the surprise of some observers, she edged out Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 a surge that has prompted supporters on social media to rally behind the hashtags #Klomentum and #Klobmentum. In a crowded field of candidates, Klobuchar carved out a path running as a pragmatic moderate from the Midwest who can consolidate support from liberal and more centrist voters alike. \"Hello, America,\" Klobuchar said to a room of supporters on Tuesday night. \"I'm Amy Klobuchar, and I will beat Donald Trump.\" \"Amy Klobuchar just shocked the establishment,\" said Howard Dean, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee, speaking on CNN on Wednesday. \"All of a sudden, Amy Klobuchar is now a serious candidate.\" Strong debate showing Her performance Tuesday followed a strong showing in Friday night's Democratic debate, which appeared to win over late-breaking undecided voters. The three-term senator dragged Buttigieg for being a \"cool newcomer.\" And she portrayed herself as a more reasonable alternative to more left-leaning candidates. She vowed to change the tone of the presidency and to be an advocate for struggling Americans. \"There is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the White House right now, and I will bring that to you,\" Klobuchar said to audience cheers during the debate. \"If you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent, I know you, and I will fight for you. If you have trouble deciding if you're going to pay for your child care or your long-term care, I know you and I will fight for you,\" she said. \"I do not have the biggest name up on this stage. I don't have the biggest bank account,\" she added. \"But I have a record of fighting for people.\" It's a message that resonated with New Hampshire voters. More than half of Klobuchar's supporters made the decision to vote for her in the last few days before the primary, according to an AP VoteCast survey of more than 3,000 Democratic primary voters in the state. \"Biden collapsed in Iowa, so moderates rotated to Buttigieg, but then he got attacked by everyone in the debates, so Klobuchar took those voters who started rethinking Buttigieg,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. The center's polling, he said, showed Klobuchar at around 6% before the Friday debate ended. She then shot up to nearly 10% in its polling just before the primary. \"All of it happened in the 72 hours preceding the election,\" he said. Part of her appeal, supporters say, is her ability to reach across the aisle and work with Republicans. In a 2019 ranking by The Lugar Center and Georgetown University judging how often lawmakers introduce legislation that attracts co-sponsors from the opposing party, Klobuchar was rated as the 23rd most bipartisan senator in Congress. Her two fellow senators running for president, Warren and Sanders, ranked 68th and 100th, respectively. On the campaign trail, Klobuchar has positioned herself within the more moderate wing of the Democratic Party: she has stopped short of endorsing \"Medicare for All,\" saying she prefers more immediate steps that will expand health care coverage. And she opposes tuition-free college. \"I have stood up on so many progressive issues, whether it is choice, whether it is the environment, whether it is standing up for immigrants and against racial injustice,\" she told NPR last year. \"But there are moments where we can find common ground.\" Nevada and South Carolina With the Democratic contest now moving to more diverse states \u2014 Nevada on Feb. 22, then South Carolina on Feb. 29 \u2014 the Klobuchar camp will be confronting a key question: Can her middle-of-the-road, problem-solver pitch win over black and Latino Democrats, whose support will be critical in upcoming contests? Her road ahead appears challenging. Klobuchar placed her first advertisement in Nevada on Tuesday and has barely spent on messaging in South Carolina, having expended much of her campaign resources in Iowa and New Hampshire. \"Candidates makes a difference in Nevada with a strong field operation. There's really no substitute for that,\" said pollster Paleologos. \"That's a big liability for Klobuchar right now.\" Another obstacle will be winning over nonwhite voters. Nevada's voters were were 41% nonwhite in the 2016 election, and 61% of South Carolina Democratic voters were African American. Klobuchar's support within these communities has been weak. For example, she polled 0% with black voters nationally in a Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted in January. \"Our senators aren't household names to everyone,\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told NPR on Wednesday. \"She doesn't have billions of dollars. But what she does have is a work ethic and a track record,\" he said. \"My only surprise is that she didn't peak earlier.\" Klobuchar has defended both her support among black voters and her prior career as a county prosecutor. During a Tuesday interview on The View, she said she has \"always has had strong support\" among African American voters in her home state of Minnesota, in addition to the backing of black community leaders who have campaigned for her, she said \"My challenge is to get people to know me,\" Klobuchar said. Another challenge will be fundraising. Klobuchar finished the fourth quarter of 2019 with less cash on hand than any of her four main rivals for the nomination. Her campaign coffers will need larger cash infusions and a significant boost to her on-the-ground campaigning if she wants to be a real contender ahead of Super Tuesday, said David Plouffe, the former campaign manager for Barack Obama, speaking on MSNBC on Tuesday. \"She's got to now put together a national campaign overnight,\" Plouffe said. Her surprise performance on Tuesday has infused her supporters with hope that she can convert a bump in momentum into fundraising dollars. Klobuchar will be in New York on Wednesday for a fundraiser, and her campaign says she has raised more than $2.5 million in the hours after polls closed in New Hampshire. Klobuchar is set to be in Nevada on Thursday and will hold a town hall sponsored by the League of United Latin American Citizens ahead of the state's caucuses in 10 days.

Deval Patrick, a former Massachusetts governor who jumped into the Democratic presidential primary months after most of his competitors did, has now ended that bid. Patrick announced his decision on Wednesday, a day after the New Hampshire primary. \"[T]he vote in New Hampshire last night was not enough for us to create the practical wind at the campaign's back to go on to the next round of voting. So I have decided to suspend the campaign, effective immediately,\" he said in a statement. The 63-year-old joined the Democratic field in November 2019, reversing an earlier decision. In December 2018, Patrick had opted against a run, citing \"the cruelty of our elections process\" and his wife's diagnosis of uterine cancer. (He said his wife was cancer-free when he made his bid official.) Patrick's entrance into the crowded primary field seemed to indicate unease among Democrats with the large group of candidates, and Patrick, a gifted campaigner who is close to former President Barack Obama, cast himself as a leader who could unify the party and bring opposing coalitions together. He also leaned into his inspiring life story, rising from his youth in Chicago to become one of only two African American men elected governor. But Patrick, who admitted his late-entry campaign was a \"Hail Mary from two stadiums over,\" began his campaign with comparably low name recognition and never gained traction in polls. He earned less than 1% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, despite leading next-door Massachusetts for two terms as governor and receiving a boost on the airwaves from a pro-Patrick superPAC. Patrick had also sought to compete in South Carolina, where African American voters make up a majority of the Democratic electorate. Patrick's departure from the race leaves eight candidates still running for the party's presidential nomination. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is the only one who is not white. Positioning himself closer to the center-left among the Democratic presidential candidates, Patrick outlined a series of broad policy agendas, including a \"democracy agenda\" and an \"opportunity agenda\" that sought universal prekindergarten among other measures. He also favored a \"public option\" expansion of Medicare. \"Patriotism demands, now more than ever, that we reject false choices,\" Patrick said in his statement Wednesday. \"Despite our righteous anger, Democrats don't have to hate Republicans to be good Democrats. We don't have to hate business to fight for social justice or to hate police to believe black lives matter. In that same spirit, we don't have to hate moderation to be a good progressive. I say that because, unlike most other candidates, I have actually delivered progressive results using a moderate approach.\" Prior to his terms as Massachusetts governor, Patrick led the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice during President Bill Clinton's administration and then was general counsel at oil company Texaco and Coca-Cola and a member of the board of directors at the parent company of mortgage lender Ameriquest. After he left office, Patrick joined Boston-based investment firm Bain Capital to launch a so-called impact investing fund.",

            "article_content": "The split between moderate and far-left Democrats only grew over the course of the 2016 presidential race. Now it's becoming one of the defining features of the 2020 race.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: As voters here prepare to cast their ballots in the state primary tomorrow, you might have a sense of deja vu. The split in the Democratic Party that defined the race four years ago is becoming one of the main features of the 2020 race as well. We're talking about the divide between party moderates and those on the far left. NPR's Scott Detrow has been following the Bernie Sanders campaign, and he is here in our New Hampshire studios. Good to see you in Manchester, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey. Good afternoon. SHAPIRO: Let's start with the Iowa results just one week ago - and maybe I should put results in air quotes there - seems as good a sign as any that this divide between the party's moderate wing and the liberal wing is in full flower. DETROW: Right. With all the questions about the exact results, we do know that Iowa elevated two people with fundamentally different views of the Democratic Party, of the role of government, of what they want to do if they become president. So Bernie Sanders - to take a step back, the entire premise, really, of his campaign is a fundamental reordering of government and of the economy as a whole. Here he was a week ago at his semi-victory, semi-I-don't-really-know-what-happened... SHAPIRO: Who even knows what's happening? DETROW: ...We're-filling-the-void-by-talking speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: Our message to Wall Street and the insurance companies and the drug companies and the fossil fuel industry and the military industrial complex... (CHEERING) SANDERS: ...And the prison industrial complex... (CHEERING) SANDERS: ...Our message to them is, change is coming. DETROW: So if you look through what he's talking about what he wants to do - think about it - health care, energy, you know, the economy, college - fundamental aspects of everyday life, he wants to blow up and rebuild in a much more progressive way. SHAPIRO: And Buttigieg? DETROW: He wants to make a lot of progress on every single one of these things for sure, but working within the existing system - big changes, but still incremental changes. So you've had Sanders really increasingly attack Pete Buttigieg as someone who represents the status quo. And in recent days, Pete Buttigieg has been pushing back on that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETE BUTTIGIEG: I respect Senator Sanders, but at a moment like this when the message goes out that you're either for a revolution or you must be for the status quo, most of us don't know where we fit and would rather be part of a movement that makes room for all of us. SHAPIRO: So how has this split shaped the other candidates' approach to the race? DETROW: So you have seen a lot of the more moderate candidates - especially Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, who's really trying to force her way into the conversation here and say, I am the better choice than Pete Buttigieg to represent this wing of the party - talk a lot about the fact that, yes, they share a lot of these big-picture goals, but they are working in a world of trying to actually get things passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives. So you hear a lot more conversation about governing, about building coalitions, about the specific legislative plan and about their experience doing this in the Senate and throughout their actual careers. Here's Klobuchar in Friday night's debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AMY KLOBUCHAR: Bernie and I work together all the time. But I think we are not going to be able to out-divide the divider in chief. And I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her instead of shutting them out. DETROW: So I think maybe the better way to frame this divide is not necessarily moderate versus progressive, but practical versus ideological. SHAPIRO: You spent a lot of time with Bernie Sanders on this campaign, as well as on his last presidential campaign. Do you see differences between the divide today and in 2016? DETROW: Yeah. And I think this is the point in the conversation where we have to really stress that the moderate versus progressive divide is very relative. Every single one of these candidates - almost every single one of these candidates has put together a platform that is far more progressive than what the Obama administration was able to accomplish. SHAPIRO: So everything's moved to the left. DETROW: Even though Bernie Sanders did not get the Democratic nomination in 2016, the party as a whole has embraced a lot of his platform - $15 minimum wage and health care. Even though there's this conversation about \"Medicare for All\" or a public option, the premise of the conversation is giving everybody health care through a government-run program, and that was the heart of Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign and 2020 campaign. SHAPIRO: NPR's Scott Detrow covering the final stretch of the New Hampshire primary campaign here in Manchester. Thanks, Scott. DETROW: Sure thing. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Fellow Iowa caucus winner Pete Buttigieg wants to claim the mantle of electability.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Democratic presidential candidates are campaigning in the final stretch before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. And there is sniping, but they're also united by a common goal - to beat President Trump. Here's former Vice President Joe Biden making that argument at a fundraising dinner for New Hampshire Democrats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: I've lost a lot in my lifetime, like a lot of you have. I lost my wife and daughter in an automobile accident. I lost my son to a long bout with brain cancer when he came home from Iraq. But I'll be damned if I'm going to stand by and lose this election to this man. We cannot let it happen. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But Democrats need a nominee before they can get to that point. Last week's messy Iowa caucuses didn't winnow the race, but will New Hampshire? NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is joining us now from Manchester. Good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What sort of decision do New Hampshire Democrats face? LIASSON: They face a choice between the two wings of the Democratic Party - the center-left and the left-left. And they're represented by the two people who claimed victory in Iowa - Bernie Sanders, who appears to have consolidated the left wing of the party with the same message that he had in 2016. Here's what he said last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: I want to thank New Hampshire for helping to lead the political revolution that began four years ago, and now is the time to complete that revolution. LIASSON: And then there's former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who's running as a Washington outsider with a message of healing divisions. He's been pushing back against Sanders' more extreme positions, like mandatory \"Medicare for All\" with his own voluntary Medicare buy-in for those who want it. And Buttigieg spent the day yesterday making a not-so-subtle swipe against Sanders' ability to beat Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETE BUTTIGIEG: We cannot risk dividing Americans' future further, saying that you must either be for a revolution or you must be for the status quo. Let's make room for everybody in this movement. LIASSON: So polls in New Hampshire show Buttigieg as second to Sanders. This is a state - Sanders is from the neighboring state of Vermont. But New Hampshire has given Sanders a tough act to follow - it's his own - because last time, in 2016, he won by 22 points over... GARCIA-NAVARRO: Wow. LIASSON: ...Hillary Clinton, after tying her in Iowa, much as he did this time. So Sanders has set the bar for himself very high. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The old cliche - right? - used to be that there were three tickets out of Iowa. Are there more than two tickets out of New Hampshire? LIASSON: That's a good question. Joe Biden certainly hopes so. Biden has been downplaying Iowa and New Hampshire. He's looking forward to the primaries and caucuses in South Carolina and Nevada. But there are many Democrats who believe Biden's fourth-place showing in Iowa obliterated his claims to be the most electable. Meanwhile, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has tried to position herself as a kind of middle ground between Bernie Sanders' democratic socialism and Buttigieg's relative centrism. It's possible Warren could continue, but it's hard to see where she finds a victory. GARCIA-NAVARRO: It has, we should say, been a terrible week for the Democratic Party, right? There was the debacle with the Iowa caucuses. President Trump was acquitted by the Senate. Trump's approval ratings are up. And the candidate that they thought could beat Trump, Joe Biden, came in fourth in Iowa. How are Democrats telling you they're feeling right now? LIASSON: They're not feeling good. You know, it's a cliche to say Democrats are bedwetters and in disarray, but the headline in Politico Playbook last week was \"Democrats In Actual Disarray.\" It's not just that Biden, the supposedly most electable candidate, finished a poor fourth in Iowa. But to people other than Sanders supporters, Sanders' candidacy is really scaring a lot of Democrats, especially those Democrats who flipped red districts blue in 2018 and took over the House. They think Sanders is an existential threat to their reelection because he is unlikely to moderate his positions to help Democrats win in competitive districts and states. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So are the establishment moderate Democrats you're talking about able to stop Sanders, or will this be like President Trump's takeover of the GOP in 2016? LIASSON: That is the big question. You know, in 2016, the Republicans had a failure of imagination. They just couldn't coalesce around an alternative to Trump. They didn't believe he'd get the nomination. Will that happen with Sanders? Unclear. Some things are different. Trump, remember, was ideologically amorphous. Was he a moderate, a conservative, a businessman who would make deals across the aisle? Sanders, on the other hand, is one of the most ideologically defined politicians in America. He's been saying the same things for 40 years. And many of the things he's calling for, whether it's mandatory Medicare for All or taxing everyone to pay for it, are majority unpopular positions in battleground states. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks much. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

After a year of intense campaigning, they finished in a virtual tie in the Iowa caucuses.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (left) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Iowa. After a year of intense campaigning, they finished in a virtual tie in the Iowa caucuses. At this point, it's pretty much time to move on. The New Hampshire primary is days away, and the results out of the Iowa Democratic caucuses are still in question. The Associated Press, which NPR and lots of other news organizations rely on to call winners and losers, said it will not be calling the race at this point, despite all votes being in, because of irregularities in the vote count. \"[T]here is evidence the party has not accurately tabulated some of its results, including those released late Thursday that the party reported as complete,\" the AP said Thursday night, as the final results rolled in. The Iowa mess may continue, but as the political world's focus shifts to New Hampshire, we can say this \u2014 Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are in a virtual tie in Iowa; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren finished third, several points behind; and former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth, with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on his heels. And here are five takeaways from those results: 1. Buttigieg and Sanders did not get to bask in the moment. The impact of the Iowa mess is clearly biggest on Buttigieg. Look at it this way \u2014 when this campaign began, people couldn't pronounce his name; he was far down in the polls; and he's gay. Yet Buttigieg finished in a virtual tie with Sanders, who is as well-known a politician as anyone in the country. Of the two, Buttigieg most needed an Iowa good-news bounce. That was denied him by the results fiasco that sucked up all the oxygen in the political room. Sanders, too, lost the opportunity for days of good press and headlines. What that means for either candidate going into a state that can reinforce or reset a previous electoral result is unclear. For what it's worth, a Monmouth University poll out Thursday showed Sanders leading in New Hampshire, followed by Buttigieg. Biden is on the decline (more on that below).

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks at a campaign stop at Nashua Community College in Nashua, N.H.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks at a campaign stop at Nashua Community College in Nashua, N.H. 2. Warren needs a win. There was a point not long ago when Warren looked like she might have the nomination sealed up. And then \"Medicare for All\" tripped her up. Her lack of a plan didn't seem bold enough for the Sanders left, and her theme of \"fighting\" Republicans made some moderates nervous she couldn't win in a general election. Warren really needs a win in New Hampshire, and that means either actually winning the primary or at least finishing ahead of Sanders. They're competing in the progressive lane, and if she again finishes behind Sanders, it's tough to see how Warren recovers. 3. Biden's finish was, indeed, a \"gut punch.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event Wednesday in Somersworth, N.H. There, he went after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as a \"democratic socialist\" and called former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg a \"risk.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Elise Amendola/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event Wednesday in Somersworth, N.H. There, he went after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as a \"democratic socialist\" and called former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg a \"risk.\" Sure, Iowa is not representative of the country. And, yes, a major part of Biden's base is African American voters and there aren't many in Iowa. But there's no excuse for finishing fourth. Biden himself called the result a \"gut punch\" Thursday in New Hampshire. Entrance polls showed 56% of the caucusgoers identified as moderates. And Biden was at or near the top in Iowa polls coming in. But instead of the lion's share of the moderate vote going to Biden, it wound up being split between Buttigieg, Biden and Klobuchar, who finished only a few points behind the former vice president. What's more, Klobuchar outpaced her polling and was definitely on the upswing in the last weekend. She had big crowds and was on the tips of the tongues of lots of moderate voters in Iowa. Biden has no one to blame but himself for the finish. Even people at Biden events, who thought they might end up with him, thought he seemed unsteady and that his message was muddled \u2014 and many went elsewhere. Recognizing the threat Buttigieg and Sanders are to his nomination, Biden started going after their vulnerabilities head-on Thursday in New Hampshire. Biden called Buttigieg a \"risk\" and questioned his experience, stressing he's only been mayor of a city with a small population. And he said President Trump will use Sanders' identifying as a democratic socialist to go after every Democrat up and down the ballot as radical leftists. Biden needs a stronger finish in New Hampshire to retain his strong support among black voters in South Carolina, which holds its contest Feb. 29. He can't afford to see his support with African Americans eroded and hope to be a strong nominee going into the convention. South Carolina is a must-win state for Biden, and he has to win it big. 4. Turnout was underwhelming \u2014 a bad sign for Democrats. Campaigns were expecting high turnout in Iowa, but it didn't happen \u2014 and that has to be worrying for Democrats. The closing campaign events were all packed. Yet turnout was more on par with 2016 than the record-setting 2008 campaign. About 172,000 turned out this year. It was 171,000 in 2016, and 239,000 in 2008. It very well may be that undecided voters stayed home and are fine with whoever wins. But Democrats were hoping to show just how enthusiastic their base is to turn out and beat President Trump. In this first contest, it didn't happen. 5. Sanders is in the pole position for the nomination but didn't help his electability argument. The Sanders campaign points to polls showing that he beats Trump in a general election. And that's true. But his performance in Iowa didn't help make his case. Sanders promised turnout would be north of 239,000. It wasn't. And he didn't turn out new voters. In fact, the percentage of first-time caucusgoers went down this year, even compared to 2016. In 2008, the percentage of first-time caucusgoers was 57%; in 2016, it was 44%; this year, it was just 35%. Sanders has a massive base of support with voters under 30, but he didn't appear to expand beyond that. Sanders won the raw-vote total, but losing in rural areas cost him delegates. Sanders' votes came from urban areas and college towns. That's not where Democrats need to show strength. So with moderates splitting the vote, and Sanders beating out Warren in Iowa, he looks stronger today for the nomination than he did before Iowa, but he didn't do much to help his argument that he's best to beat Trump.",

            "article_content": "What are the stakes tonight for each of the candidates in Monday night's Iowa caucuses? Here's what the Democratic field stands to gain or lose \u2014 and how they're making their final arguments in Iowa.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: It is finally here - the first day of voting in the 2020 presidential election. Candidates are in Iowa making their last-minute pitches to Iowans who caucus today. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) ELIZABETH WARREN: Hello, Indianola. UNIDENTIFIED CANDIDATE #1: Thank you so much. JOE BIDEN: It's good to see you guys again. UNIDENTIFIED CANDIDATE #2: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED CANDIDATE #3: Thank you, Nevada. UNIDENTIFIED CANDIDATE #4: Hey, you guys. Wow. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Unbelievable - wow. KELLY: Covering it all, NPR political reporters Asma Khalid and Scott Detrow - they are in Des Moines for the caucuses. So what are these last-minute pitches? What are the closing arguments you're hearing from candidates? ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Well, for Joe Biden - let's start there. He has largely been making his closing argument about his record, his resume and his experience, you know, sort of making the argument that he is the most electable, the most likely Democrat to defeat Donald Trump in a general election. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: And Bernie Sanders is pivoting off of that and saying the electability is not being reliable and somebody people know and trust but being somebody who excites a party's base, brings younger voters, newer voters out. Sanders is making that pitch for himself and talking about, you know, the issues he's been talking about for years - \"Medicare for All,\" protecting Social Security - things like that. Pete Buttigieg, interestingly to me, was the only Democrat out here really making hard contrasts with other candidates over the past few days, arguing that Joe Biden is just kind of the status quo; Bernie Sanders is talking about revolution. Pete Buttigieg is saying, I am talking about something in between these two extreme options, and I'm also a younger, fresher face. And historically, that's gone well for the Democratic Party. KHALID: And the other leading candidate in this race has been Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator. KELLY: Right. KHALID: And, you know, interestingly, I would say her argument lately has sounded different than it did at the beginning of the campaign. You hear her surrogates now making the argument that she is the consensus candidate - you know, that the party needs unity, and she is the most likely candidate who could bring the Joe Biden and the Bernie Sanders wings of this party together. You know, she's also talking about her record of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and just being somebody who, she would make the argument, can get stuff done. KELLY: Yeah. And I'm imagining that it's been a day of transport as well. I know senators have been back in Washington for the impeachment trial. They're making their way back to Iowa, so there's a lot of movement back-and-forth. What is the headline of what you were hearing from voters - whether these closing arguments, which have some real differences as you paint them - whether they are resonating? Scott, you first. DETROW: Yeah, I think one key theme is that there's just a lot of excitement. There has been deep engagement with these candidates since Day 1 of this campaign, which was more than a year ago, to the point where the Sanders campaign especially is talking about the likelihood of Iowa Democrats breaking their all-time caucusing record, which was set in 2008. About 240,000 people caucused in 2008, and the Sanders campaign is saying if it gets to 250,000, we feel like we have a good chance to win because that means we succeeded at turning new voters out. A lot of people we talked to are excited, but as I'm sure Asma could tell you, there's also a lot of uncertainty, a lot of hesitation about making that final decision in this crowded field. KHALID: I think that's what's been most striking to me is the number of caucusgoers up till last night at some of these final rallies... DETROW: Yeah. KHALID: ...Who told me that they still don't know. Some of them asked me - coming to me as a reporter, being like, you know, you've covered all these people. What do you think I should do? I said, that's not really my job, but I hope that you'll listen to our coverage. But I think people feel so perplexed about what to do, and more so than we saw certainly four years ago. But, Mary Louise, I will say one thing I think that is so striking about this year is that even if people do not know who they want as a candidate, there is a lot of enthusiasm on the Democratic side about the need to defeat Donald Trump. And because of that, I think, to Scott's point, we likely - you know, the party is saying they expect to see record levels of turnout. KELLY: So if people - a lot of people still haven't made up their mind, you're telling me, and there are some new rules in place that might make the early dynamics a little bit more fluid. Does that mean we might see - I don't know - a more dynamic night than in caucuses past? DETROW: I think it's truly liberating as a journalist right now to have no idea how this is going to turn out in a few hours. I mean, you have this big chunk of - you know, up to 40% we were seeing in a lot of surveys could change their mind. And, of course, the caucus process - you go, you hear campaigns make their arguments. You see your friends and neighbors picking opponents or maybe the same side as you. There's a lot of persuasion that can happen in the moment in a way that just going into a voting booth, it doesn't happen. So I think we could see a whole range of outcomes tonight, and I'm really excited to see what happens. I could spend the next 10 minutes giving you a scenario of how any one of these candidates comes out on top in Iowa. KHALID: And this is also one of the issues... KELLY: We may have time tonight as the live coverage unfolds - Asma. DETROW: (Laughter). KHALID: I was going to mention that I think what will also be interesting is we're going to get a chance to see first voter preferences this year. We've never seen that information before, but what it means is that the actual winner might not match the person who came in and got the most preferences the first go-around. So I think what we could see is candidates spinning these results... KELLY: Yeah. KHALID: ...Whichever way looks favorable to them. KELLY: Just briefly, whichever of you wants to take this - but what are the stakes for the candidates in terms of who needs to have a really strong finish going forward into the next primaries and caucuses to come? DETROW: You know, I think looking at the top four, I think the candidate who has the most riding on tonight is Pete Buttigieg. He is, of course, the exception to this campaign that has been dominated by known faces who have been on the national scene for a while. He has staked his campaign on Iowa. He's excited a lot of voters here. The question is, does that excitement turn out? When you've basically lived in Iowa and camped out in Iowa for a month, you got to do well in Iowa. KELLY: Yeah. All right. So y'all have been there, obviously, talking with voters in Iowa and candidates in Iowa. I want to point out that for the first time this year, Iowans away from home will not be locked out of the caucus process necessarily, and that includes Iowans living abroad. This year, there are three international caucuses. They are in Paris, in Glasgow, Scotland, and Tbilisi, Georgia. And I want to just pause there for a minute. Tbilisi, Georgia - going to see if either of you can beat John Horan to the punch. He is one of three Iowans who caucused in Tbilisi, Georgia, earlier today. JOHN HORAN: My friend and fellow Iowan - my only fellow Iowan friend in Tbilisi texted me, and he'd heard that the Democratic Party of Iowa was initiating these satellite caucuses. And the pun just immediately came to him, and he texted me, caucuses in the Caucasus - this, of course, being the Caucasus region. And it was a great feeling to be part of this. I mean, it was kind of funny to hear the chair say, OK, now everyone separate into the different parts of the room, whereas, of course, it's a very small room. It's just an apartment. It was a very short proceeding, actually. We celebrated with pizza and ranch, as is the custom back in Iowa, and having some Georgian wine on top of that. KELLY: So that was John Horan, our caucuser in the Caucasus in Tbilisi, Georgia. Scott and Asma, I very much hope that you got some Georgian wine with your pizza and ranch for tonight. DETROW: I don't know if that's on the menu. I just hope our colleague Scott Horsley heard that because he loves puns more than anyone in the world. KELLY: We will wrap him into the future coverage. Scott Detrow and Asma Khalid, covering the campaign in Iowa - thanks so much. Talk to you through the night. DETROW: We'll talk to you soon. KHALID: Bye-bye - my pleasure.

But now, it appears those voters are coming back. A year ago, some New Hampshire progressives, who had elevated Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to a decisive victory in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary there, told NPR they weren't so sure they wanted to see him run for president again. But with just days until the first votes of the 2020 presidential contest, in Iowa, it appears that progressives are coming back to Sanders. His polling has risen in recent weeks, as a number of progressive groups announced their support for him and as many voters on the left ultimately decided to stick with him. Burt Cohen is one such voter. He's known Sanders since the 1970s, and in the last presidential election he was a delegate for the Vermont senator at the Democratic National Convention. But Cohen was initially skeptical of a Sanders sequel. \"I wasn't sure it was a good idea, to be perfectly honest,\" the former New Hampshire state senator-turned-podcast host said recently. \"What held me back a little bit was, as Bernie says, 'It's not me, it's us,' and that so many other candidates were picking up what he was talking about.\" Many progressives said similar things at the beginning of this campaign cycle. They felt the issues that Sanders has championed, such as \"Medicare for All,\" were now part of the party's mainstream debate. But as the campaign dragged on, some voters, like New Hampshire gubernatorial candidate Andy Volinsky, began to have doubts about other candidates. \"I am not convinced that Sanders' level of commitment to things like Medicare for All exists among very many other candidates,\" he said. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren speaks during a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Maturen/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren speaks during a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sunday. In 2016, Volinsky was Sanders' New Hampshire attorney. But this year, he took months to make a decision. He said he was impressed with Elizabeth Warren and even introduced her at a rally. But he was worried that the Massachusetts senator is \"not as readily accepted by working people as Bernie is.\" That was a common concern voiced by progressive voters who said they had considered Warren before coming back to Sanders. \"I had been for Warren back in 2015,\" Cohen said. \"I had a sticker on my car \u2014 'Run, Warren, Run.' \" He said Warren would make a \"terrific\" president but, he said, Democrats need a candidate who can win back the voters the party lost in 2016. \"Frankly,\" he said, \"the Harvard, professorial style, I don't know how well that would do in the Midwest.\" But that same concern is what led Bill Stelling away from Sanders, whom he supported in 2016, and toward Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., this year. \"One of the things about Bernie is that I don't think he's evolved very much since 2016,\" said Stelling, of Manchester, N.H. \"He's delivering exactly the same message, but the world has changed.\" This notion \u2014 that consistency might not always be a virtue \u2014 is perhaps progressives' most common critique of the Vermont senator. A Sanders-or-Warren family \"Maybe Bernie hasn't changed, but the times have,\" said Ron Abramson. He and his daughter, Quincy, both supported Sanders in 2016. He held a house party for the senator. She volunteered for him. But this year, they're not in sync. Ron wants a leader who can effectively govern and adapt if needed. He said that's Warren. Quincy wants drastic change. She thinks capitalism is the root of almost every problem in this country, so she told her dad how she sees Warren: \"She does know how to work within the system more and play the game better and, for you, that's pragmatic, and for me, that's scary.\" Quincy is supporting Sanders again. She said she came to that decision partly because of how he speaks, compared with Warren. \"The feeling I get from the way Warren talks about going into office is, you know, 'I have a plan for that. Vote for me. Trust me, and I'll handle it,' \" she said. \"While Bernie's is, 'We have to do this together.' \" But Ron is skeptical of his daughter's interpretation of Sanders as a more collaborative leader. \"I appreciate that he has created a movement,\" he said, \"but there's a fine line between a movement and a cult of personality.\"",

As they prepare to caucus, voters weigh which candidate to support and what health care should look like in the future. Glenn Hurst didn't grow up dreaming of becoming a doctor. But eventually, he made his way into health care, taking a job placing doctors in small towns. Traveling farm country, he says, the work moved him in ways he didn't expect. \"To see the physicians in those communities helping those people stay in their fields, helping those people's families be safe ... I decided that I wanted to be part of something rural and I wanted to be part of health care,\" he says. These days, Hurst is a doctor and runs a rural health clinic in tiny Minden, Iowa, population about 600. It's work where he sees hardship firsthand. He talks about farmers who sew themselves up with fish wire just so they don't lose hours of work during harvest. The closest hospital is about 30 minutes away. Hurst performs rounds at the Northcrest Living Center in Council Bluffs. He runs a tiny health clinic about 25 miles away in Minden.\n                \n                    \n                    Walker Pickering for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hurst performs rounds at the Northcrest Living Center in Council Bluffs. He runs a tiny health clinic about 25 miles away in Minden. Then there are his own struggles at the clinic. He says that ever since Iowa privatized Medicaid in 2016, he's seen many legitimate Medicaid claims denied by private insurance companies. As a result, he's found himself treating some patients knowing he won't get paid. He's taken out $15,000 in loans to keep his clinic open and worries he won't make payroll for his employees. \"Every second Friday I worry about that,\" he says. Health care has consistently polled as the No. 1 issue voters care about in Iowa. With Monday's caucuses less than 72 hours away, decision time is rapidly approaching for voters like Hurst who are not just weighing which candidate to back, but what health care should look like in the future. Much of the debate in Iowa has centered around the Republican push to privatize Medicaid, the state-federal program that helps provide health care coverage for the poor. Privatization was passed in 2016 by the state's then-governor, Republican Terry Branstad, on a promise that it would save taxpayers money. But across the state, there's disagreement over whether privatization has worked. Hospitals, nursing homes and other providers caring for the state's more than 615,000 Medicaid patients say denials and delays have left them strapped. More changes could be on the way. On Thursday, the Trump administration announced a plan that would allow states to place caps on Medicaid spending. Left, Hurst performs his rounds at the Northcrest Living Center. Among his patients is Lyle Rodenburg, right.\n                \n                    \n                    Walker Pickering for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Left, Hurst performs his rounds at the Northcrest Living Center. Among his patients is Lyle Rodenburg, right. Even before the announcement, there have been fears across Iowa that rural hospitals' dire financial situations could cause them to close. One recent analysis found that nearly 18% of rural hospitals in Iowa are at a high risk of closing unless their financial situations improve. The candidates and their plans A CNN poll earlier this month shows that among the solutions offered by Democratic candidates, 24% of likely Iowa caucusgoers say that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has the policy position that aligns most closely with their own. Former Vice President Joe Biden polled second on the question, with 16%, followed by former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 15% and Massachusetts. Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 14%. Together, Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren comprise the top tier of four candidates in Iowa. Sanders and Warren support \"Medicare for All,\" a national health insurance program where coverage is provided to everyone and private health insurance would mostly go away. Biden and Buttigieg support a system that incorporates government-provided insurance coverage that the public can choose to buy into if they are unhappy with their private plan. Hurst, himself a local Democratic party chair, supports a single-payer, Medicare for All model. He says he would prefer a president like Sanders or Warren, but that he could also back a more moderate candidate who didn't support total overhaul. \"We will not achieve perfection,\" he says. \"Our goal will always be to strive for improvement. ... It is perfectly OK to accept and support somebody who is willing to make progress towards that perfection.\" For voters like Pat Coffman, the choice could come down to affordability. Coffman, who serves as the activities director at a nursing home in Council Bluffs, says she has health insurance but struggles to afford it. \"I'm one of the underinsured,\" she says. \"I have insurance through my job. But the deductible is $6,600.\" Coffman has a chronic illness and is supposed to see a gastro specialist regularly but doesn't because of the cost. She's been taking out loans to try to get there. Then, last summer, she suffered injuries after falling down the stairs. \"I broke my nose in three places. I had a terrible concussion \u2014 75 stitches,\" she says. The final bill was about $30,000, most of which she says insurance covered. But she still owed $6,000, in addition to the loans she was still paying off. She feels like it's just too much. She plans to back Sanders on Monday.",

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Bernie Sanders seems to be consolidating support among progressive voters. A year ago, that was not so clear. Back then, NPR's Asma Khalid spoke to voters in New Hampshire, who helped Sanders win big in the state in the 2016 primary, but they weren't sure they wanted the Vermont senator to run for president again. In recent days, Asma has been talking to many of those voters again trying to figure out why they are back with Bernie. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Burt Cohen has known Bernie Sanders since the 1970s. In the last presidential election, he was a delegate for the senator at the Democratic convention. But he was initially skeptical of a Sanders sequel. BURT COHEN: I wasn't sure it was a good idea, to be perfectly honest. KHALID: Why's that? What gave you that hesitation? COHEN: What held me back a little bit was that, as Bernie says, it's not me; it's us - and that so many other candidates were picking up what he was talking about. KHALID: I heard this from a lot of progressives at the beginning of this campaign cycle. They felt that issues such as \"Medicare for All,\" that Sanders has championed, were now part of the party's mainstream debate. But as the campaign season dragged on, some, like Andy Volinsky began to have doubts about other candidates. ANDY VOLINSKY: I am not convinced that Sanders' level of commitment to things like Medicare for All exists among very many other candidates. KHALID: In 2016, Volinsky was Sanders' New Hampshire attorney, but this year he took months to make a decision. He told me he was really impressed with Elizabeth Warren. He even introduced her at a rally. But there was one major worry he had. VOLINSKY: She's not as readily accepted by working people as Bernie is.

I had a sticker on my car - run, Warren, run. KHALID: He says Warren would make a terrific president, but he says Democrats need a candidate who can win back the very voters the party lost in 2016. COHEN: Frankly, you know, the Harvard professorial style, I don't know how well that would do in the Midwest. KHALID: But that same concern is what led Bill Stelling away from Bernie Sanders and toward Pete Buttigieg this year. BILL STELLING: One of the things about Bernie is that I don't think he's evolved very much since 2016. He's delivering exactly the same message. But the world has changed. KHALID: This notion that consistency might not always be a virtue is probably the most common critique I heard from progressive critics. RON ABRAMSON: Maybe Bernie hasn't changed, but the times have. KHALID: That's Ron Abramson. He and his daughter Quincy both supported Sanders in 2016. He held a house party for the senator; she volunteered for him. But this year they are not in sync. He wants a leader who can effectively govern and adapt if needed. He says that's Warren. She wants drastic change. She thinks capitalism is the root of almost every problem in this country.

While Bernie's is, we have to do this together. KHALID: But Ron doesn't buy his daughter's interpretation of Sanders. R ABRAMSON: I appreciate that he has created a movement, but there's a fine line between a movement and a cult of personality. KHALID: For many progressives, these primaries are an either-or decision between Warren and Sanders. But still, Sanders has seen his political fortunes rise in recent weeks as a number of progressive groups announced their support for him and as some voters on the left who initially hesitated when he announced his presidential rerun have ultimately decided to stick with him.

No wonder voters list health and the high price of care as one of their major election concerns as they head to the polls. Health care has been a leading issue in the presidential campaign over the past year, as Democratic candidates have clashed with each other, and especially with President Trump. But voters, who tell pollsters that health is among their top concerns, also complain that the health debate has been confusing and hard to follow. With voting about to begin in many states, here's a guide to some key health care terms, issues and policy differences at play. Universal coverage, \"Medicare for All\" and single-payer are not the same thing Universal coverage is any method of ensuring that all of a nation's residents have health insurance. Other countries do it in various ways: through public programs, private programs or a combination. A single-payer system is one in which a single entity, usually but not always a government, pays for needed health care services. Single-payer is not the same as socialized medicine. The latter generally refers to a system in which the government pays all the bills, owns the health facilities and employs the health professionals who work there. In a single-payer system, such as Medicare in the U.S., the bills are paid by the government but the delivery system remains mostly private. Medicare for All is a proposal that was originally developed in the late 1980s. Building on the popularity of the Medicare program for senior citizens, the idea was to extend that program to the entire population. However, since Medicare's benefits have fallen behind those of many private insurance plans, the later iterations of Medicare for All would create an entirely new, and very generous, program for all Americans. Voters are even more concerned about health care costs than about losing health care coverage While Democrats fight over how best to cover more people with insurance, the majority of Americans already have coverage and are much more worried about the cost, according to polls. A recent survey of voters in three states with early contests \u2014 Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire \u2014 found voters in all three ranked concerns about high out-of-pocket costs far ahead of concerns about insurance coverage itself. 'It's the prices, stupid' There's a good reason voters are so concerned about what they are being asked to pay for medical services. U.S. health spending is dramatically higher than that of other industrialized nations. In 2016 the U.S. spent 25% more per person than the next highest-spending country, Switzerland. Overall, U.S. health spending is more than twice the average of other Western nations. But that's not because Americans use more health services than citizens of other developed nations. We just pay more for the services we use. In other words, as the late health economist Uwe Reinhardt and colleagues quipped in 2003: \"It's the Prices, Stupid.\" A subsequent study published by the team last year confirmed that is still the case. \"Because the differential between what the public and private sectors pay for medical services has grown significantly in the past fifteen years, U.S. policy makers should focus on prices in the private sector,\" the researchers say. Drug companies and insurers aren't the only ones responsible for high prices To listen to many of the candidates' messages, it may seem drug companies and health insurers are together responsible for most \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the high health spending in the U.S. \"The giant pharmaceutical and health insurance lobbies have spent billions of dollars over the past decades to ensure that their profits come before the health of the American people,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders says on his presidential campaign website. \"We must defeat them, together.\" Most insurance spending, though, actually goes for care delivered by doctors and hospitals. And some of their practices are far more gouging to patients than high prices charged by drugmakers or administrative costs added by insurance companies. Wall Street firms that have bought physician groups are helping block a legislative solution to \"surprise bills\" \u2014 the often huge charges faced by patients who inadvertently get care outside their insurance network. And hospitals around the country are being called out by the news media for suing their patients over bills almost no patient can afford. Democrats and Republicans have very different views on how to fix health care To the extent health has been addressed in the presidential race, stories have mostly been about disagreements among Democrats: Some want Medicare for All, while others are pushing for less sweeping change \u2014 often described as a \"public option\" that would allow but not require people to purchase a government health plan. However, there are much bigger divides between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats nearly all support a larger role for government in health care; they just disagree on how much larger it should be. Meanwhile, Republicans generally want to see less government and more market forces brought to bear. The Trump administration has already either implemented or proposed a variety of ways to decrease regulation of private insurance and is weighing whether to allow states to effectively cap the amount of money they spend on Medicaid patients. And in the biggest difference of all for the coming election, the Trump administration and a group of GOP-led states are, again, challenging the entire Affordable Care Act in court, arguing that it is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has opted not to decide the case ahead of the 2020 election, but it is likely to continue to be a major issue in the campaign. There are important health issues beyond insurance coverage and costs While Medicare for All and drug prices have dominated the political debate recently, other critical health issues have received far less attention. Some candidates have talked about how to best provide and pay for long-term care, which will become a growing need as baby boomers swell the ranks of the \"oldest old.\" Several have addressed mental health and addiction issues, a continuing public health crisis. And a few have laid out plans for the special needs of Americans in rural areas and those with disabilities.

            "article_content": "Democratic senators were off the campaign trail with the impeachment trial underway, but they still managed to argue about substance and style. Meanwhile, the race in Iowa remains volatile.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: This year is an unusual presidential race for all kinds of reasons. Not only is the Senate holding an impeachment trial for the incumbent, four of the people hoping to replace him are Senators stuck in Washington for the duration. To get a sense of this unusual dynamic and what's been happening in Iowa and New Hampshire without some of the frontrunners, we are joined by two of our reporters covering the race. Scott Detrow is here in Washington, just like those senators. And Asma Khalid is in Manchester, N.H. Good to have you both here. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey there. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hey there. SHAPIRO: Let's start by listening to Senator Sanders talking to his supporters in Des Moines, Iowa, at the beginning of this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: I'm going to be stuck in Washington for God knows how long. So we need you to take my place. Give two hours speeches like I do, you know? SHAPIRO: You can always count on him to be frank. Scott, how big of a problem is it that these candidates are stuck in the capital? DETROW: To drop some top-notch punditry on you, it is hard to run for president when you are threatened with arrest for speaking... SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Right. DETROW: ...For hours at a time. Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet are all in the Senate chamber for hours and hours at a time at a time when you would be campaigning as much as possible. They're doing their best to get around this. There are TV cameras and reporters everywhere in the building. And every break, you see the presidential candidates making their way to a camera... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Right now, we have with us Democratic Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Michael Bennet of Colorado. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: ...Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and as you know, a presidential candidate. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: ...Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, and she joins us now from Washington. DETROW: ...To talk to cable news, to talk to reporters, to do hits with local stations in New Hampshire and Iowa. SHAPIRO: Yeah. DETROW: And you're also seeing them be a little bit creative. Amy Klobuchar has sent her daughter Abigail out on the campaign trail in Iowa. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ABIGAIL BESSLER: Hello. I came up with Brooklyn, N.Y., to Brooklyn, Iowa. And I'm actually finding there's a lot more similarities between the two than you would think. SHAPIRO: Is this a campaign ad? DETROW: Her daughter took over her Twitter account. They're trying to do creative ways on social media as well. Bernie Sanders has a little bit more surrogate firepower than Amy Klobuchar. He has Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez out campaigning for him this week. SHAPIRO: Well, this gives a little more elbow room to people like Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. Asma, I know you were with the former vice president today. Does his campaign have an advantage here with the others being stuck in the Senate? KHALID: So, you know, he will not say - nor will his campaign openly say that this gives them an advantage. But let's be clear - he was campaigning today, this morning, in New Hampshire. He has another stop in New Hampshire tomorrow. Those senators that Scott was talking about, they can't be here in New Hampshire today and tomorrow. So I think it's fair to say. And, you know, look; I hear this more so from voters both in Iowa and in New Hampshire - I was just recently in Iowa - who will say to me, you know, look; Pete Buttigieg can be out here. Joe Biden can. And they wonder what it's going to be like for some of these senators. But at this point, you know, I will say you're not going to hear a campaign openly acknowledge this built-in advantage that they have. SHAPIRO: Well, there has been a substantive disagreement this week over Social Security, kind of a nasty fight between Sanders and Biden. Scott, explain it. DETROW: This is a situation where two candidates with decades-long voting records, track records of public statements, those long records are coming into focus. Bernie Sanders has been highlighting and his campaign has been posting videos of statements Joe Biden made when he was a senator in the 1990s talking about the need, as part of broader reining in of government spending, to take a look at freezing or even trimming Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid entitlements, things very popular with Democratic voters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: When I argued if we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veteran benefits - I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time. DETROW: Now the Biden campaign has pushed back pretty hard, saying this takes the broader context out of things, that he was talking about cutting spending everywhere. And he has said that as president, he would strengthen Social Security by increasing revenue going into it and by even expanding it, not talking about freezing or cutting it at all. And Biden has pushed back saying look; if we want to look at long voting records, let's look at the fact that Bernie Sanders voted against a lot of gun control in the 1990s during this same period. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: I find it amazing that we go back and look at statements, many of them - most of them taken out of context of 10, 20, 30, 35 years ago. It's like my going back and pointing out how Bernie voted against the Brady Bill five times while I was trying to get it passed when he was in the House. DETROW: You can expect the two of them to continue clarifying their differences. This is one of those examples of the Democratic Party changing how it views things and Joe Biden changing along with it, where Bernie Sanders, when he was such an outlier in, you know, the mid-1990s or even five, 10 years ago is now where a lot of the party is now. SHAPIRO: Speaking of attacks, Michael Bloomberg, former New York City mayor, launched some this week. But they were not targeted at fellow Democrats, and not even just at President Trump. He's taking on Republican senators here. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: When the Republican Congress wouldn't hold him accountable, I went to work helping run winning campaigns in 21 House seats. It's time for the Senate to act and remove Trump from office. And if they won't do their jobs this November, you and I will. SHAPIRO: Asma, what is this strategy by Mayor Bloomberg? KHALID: So, Ari, I think that a lot of Democratic voters are wondering about this. I mean, the TV spot there that we heard, that is interesting because it's running in states with Republican senators who are facing these pretty tight reelection contests. So, you know, think of Susan Collins in Maine - right? - or Cory Gardner in Colorado. And Michael Bloomberg has another hit out recently also that's talking about the Pentagon and President Trump there, another ad targeting President Trump and infrastructure. And he, you know, in some ways, is really trying to get under the president's skin. You know, he is somebody who has a lot of money. He has spent to date about a quarter of a billion dollars. It is just so much more money than what we're seeing some of these other candidates spend. And, you know, he's not running - he's not really competing in any of the first four early voting states. And so I think a lot of questions that Democratic voters have right now is, well, what is he doing? Is he running for the Democratic nomination, or is he running against President Trump and against Republicans more broadly? And I don't know that we'll have clarity on that answer until we actually move beyond the first four states. SHAPIRO: So with so many different approaches by the various candidates and just 10 days until the Iowa caucuses, what are you both looking for? DETROW: I think we truly have no idea who's going to win the Iowa caucuses, which is liberating... SHAPIRO: That's exciting. DETROW: ...And exciting and interesting. We have seen - a few more polls are probably going to come out this weekend, but we have seen different leaders in different polls in different times, and by and large, those four top candidates all about within the margin of error. All of these campaigns have organizers on the ground making sure people are ready to show up and caucus on February 3. And I think whatever the result may be will drastically shift these national polls we've been paying so much attention to. SHAPIRO: Those four, just to clarify, being Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg. DETROW: Yes. And at the same time, you have Amy Klobuchar getting several key endorsements and feeling like she is gaining some support at the right time. SHAPIRO: Asma, what are you looking for? KHALID: You know, I don't know that we have any certainty about what's going to be happening. And that's what makes covering this election so exciting, is the degree of uncertainty that we have. And I often get the question from voters, you know, what do you think is going to go on? You traveled all these other states. They want the intel because they want to know who they should go with because they want to choose the candidate that is most, quote, unquote, \"electable.\" So I am very curious to see where we end up after the Iowa caucuses. But because of that, I do get the sense that Super Tuesday, when we are going to have a massive haul of delegates - you're just going to have a lot of delegates at stake in places like California and Texas - that Super Tuesday is going to be really consequential. And I know that that's weeks and weeks away at this point, but all I'd say is this election, this primary, could be going on for a little while. SHAPIRO: NPR's Asma Khalid in Manchester, N.H., Hampshire and Scott Detrow here in Washington, thank you both. DETROW: Sure thing. KHALID: You're welcome.

Bernie Sanders participate in a Democratic presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 14. The two septuagenarians have sparred in recent days about Social Security. Former Vice President Joe Biden is defending his record on Social Security, amid increased criticism from the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, which has repeatedly pointed to Biden's willingness as a U.S. senator to back spending freezes for Social Security and other entitlement programs. The candidates' back-and-forth culminated \u2014 as most disputes in modern presidential campaigns do \u2014 in dueling Twitter posts Tuesday night. \"Let's be honest, Joe,\" Sanders' campaign account wrote. \"One of us fought for decades to cut Social Security, and one of us didn't.\" The tweet included a clip from a speech Biden delivered in the mid-1990s, saying, \"When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans' benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once \u2014 I tried it twice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.\" Let\u2019s be honest, Joe. One of us fought for decades to cut Social Security, and one of us didn\u2019t. But don\u2019t take it from me. Take it from you. pic.twitter.com/qh7qb1Hmcl Biden, who served decades as a Delware senator, responded on his own account, writing: \"I've been fighting to protect \u2014 and expand \u2014 Social Security for my whole career. Any suggestion otherwise is just flat-out wrong.\" For years Biden expressed worries about the ever-increasing federal debt, and repeatedly signaled he'd look at so-called \"entitlements\" \u2014  Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 along with other government spending in order to rein in the debt. But Biden reiterated in a Wednesday morning TV interview that as president he'd focus on raising new revenue, rather than any freezes or cuts, in order to address Social Security's long-term viability. I've been fighting to protect \u2014 and expand \u2014 Social Security for my whole career. Any suggestion otherwise is just flat-out wrong. pic.twitter.com/KWIIJgFqGk The intraparty feud comes less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, and as national polls out Wednesday show Biden and Sanders are solidifying their holds as the two strongest candidates in the Democratic presidential field. A CNN survey finds Sanders and Biden 10 points ahead of their closest competitor, and a Monmouth University poll showed a similar gap. (Sanders leads in CNN's survey, while Biden is ahead in Monmouth's. The two are leading in the Iowa polling average as well.) Sanders isn't the only one digging up positions and speeches from the 1990s. Biden, like Hillary Clinton in 2016, is criticizing Sanders' earlier votes against gun control measures. Pulling out snippets from decades-old speeches on Social Security, Biden told MSNBC Wednesday, is \"like my going back and pointing out how \u2014 how Bernie voted against the Brady Bill five times. ... Or how he voted to, you know, protect gun manufacturers. It's the only group in America you can't sue. I mean, he's made up for that. He's indicated that was past.\" Sanders did repeatedly vote against the Brady Bill, which when passed implemented background checks and other measures, but also voted for a federal assault weapons ban, and many other gun control measures. \"Way back in 1988, before it was fashionable, I ran for the United States Congress in Vermont, and I probably lost that election because I believed then that assault weapons should be banned,\" Sanders told the NPR Politics Podcast this summer. That the criticisms \u2014 a couple videos posted to social media accounts, and a handful of statements from campaign staffers and the candidates \u2014 count as a significant escalation is itself a sign of how relatively tame and friendly the 2020 Democratic primary has been so far. These barbs aren't coming via paid TV ads. And Biden and Sanders have stood near each other at six debates but have largely refrained from any direct confrontations, other than Sanders' repeated criticisms of Biden's vote to authorize the 2003 Iraq war. Despite hints from Sanders' campaign that he'd attack Biden over Social Security at the most recent debate, the confrontation never happened. From left: Democratic presidential candidates Hawaii Rep.

The Democratic field has vowed to unite once a nominee is named, and do everything they collectively can to defeat President Trump. On Monday, Sanders, Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other candidates all walked arm-in-arm at a South Carolina march honoring Martin Luther King Jr. Still, the debate over Social Security will likely amplify over the next week-and-a-half, as Biden and Sanders each campaign in the final stretch before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. Sanders' line of criticism isn't new. When Sanders shot to national prominence in 2010 with an eight-hour speech criticizing a tax compromise orchestrated by Biden, Sanders warned that a portion of the agreement \u2014 a temporary cut in Social Security payroll taxes \u2014 could lay the groundwork for eventual cuts to the program. \"This is a very dangerous step forward for those of us who believe in Social Security,\" he said at the time. Sanders has long made iron-clad commitments to increasing, rather than freezing or cutting, entitlements like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid a key part of his political brand. Biden, like many other Democratic politicians, has long warned about the long-term health of Social Security. But speaking to MSNBC Wednesday, he reiterated that he views the solution as increasing the money going into the program, rather than cutting or freezing the benefits. \"If everyone above $400,000 pays the same amount, or the same percentage in income as you do when you're making $100,000, we're solving \u2014 my grandkids are set. I'm able to increase Social Security payments for the two groups I mentioned,\" Biden told Morning Joe.",

Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., (left) Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., (right) will be among the candidates debating. If the last few Democratic presidential debates are any guide, tonight's will likely delve into health care proposals. Do voters know what we're talking about when we talk about various plans and concepts, including \"Medicare for All?\" Or any of the other health policy terms that get thrown around? Pretty much no. According to one poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 87% of Democrats support \"Medicare for All,\" while 64% of Democrats support \"single-payer health care.\" Here's the catch \u2014 those two phrases describe almost the same thing. The language in this debate is murky, confusing and hugely consequential. So we're laying out some key terms to help you keep up. Single-payer This is a kind of health care system where the government provides insurance to everyone. Think about it as if you're a doctor: a patient comes in, and you treat them. Who's paying you for that care? Under our current system, it could be a variety of payers: state Medicaid programs, Medicare, or  a private insurance company like Aetna or Cigna or Blue Cross and Blue Shield \u2014 each with different rates and different services that they cover. Instead, under the single-payer model, there's just one, single payer: the government. Medicare for All If single-payer is fruit, Medicare for All is a banana. In other words, single-payer is a category of coverage, and Medicare for All is a specific proposal, originally written by presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (as he often reminds us). It envisions the creation of a national health insurance program, with coverage provided to everyone, based on the idea that access to health care is a human right. Private health insurance would mostly go away, and there would be no premiums or cost-sharing for patients. Important note: it would not actually just expand Medicare as it exists now for all people (as you might guess from the name). Medicare doesn't cover a whole lot of things that this proposed program would cover, like hearing and vision and dental and long-term care. Public option The idea of a \"public option\" was floated back in 2009 when the Affordable Care Act was being debated. The idea is that along with the private health insurance plans that you might have access to through your employer or through the individual insurance exchanges, there would be an option to buy into a government-run insurance program, like Medicare. Private insurance would still exist, but people could choose to get a government insurance plan instead. There are many kinds of public option proposals, and different presidential candidates have their own ideas on how it would work, whether it's lowering the age for Medicare access or creating a new program that's not Medicare or Medicaid that people could buy into, among others. The idea is that the government might be able to offer a more affordable option for people, which could push down prices in the private insurance world. Pete Buttigieg's plan \u2014 \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" \u2014 is his version of a public option. And Elizabeth Warren announced November 15 that she'd start with a public option plan before trying to push the country toward Medicare for All. \"Government-run\" health care Many opponents of Medicare for All and other health proposals use the term \"government-run\" as a dig against them, including President Trump. (Sometimes the term \"socialized medicine\" is used as well.) In the U.K. and some other places, the government doesn't just pay people's health care bills, it also owns hospitals and employs doctors and other providers \u2014 that's a government-run health care system. The single-payer concept being discussed in this country's presidential campaign would not operate like that \u2014 the industry would still be mostly private, but the government would pay the bills. How the government would generate the money to pay those bills is subject to debate.) Universal coverage This isn't a plan, it's a goal that everyone has health insurance \u2014 that health insurance coverage is universal. The Affordable Care Act made a system for states to expand Medicaid and created the individual health insurance exchanges, , both of which significantly cut down on the number of uninsured people, but currently 27 million Americans do not have health insurance, and the rate of people who lack insurance is rising. Most Democratic presidential candidates would like to achieve universal coverage \u2014 the debate is about the best approach to get there.",

Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Democrats all want one thing: to beat Donald Trump. The problem is, they can't agree on who's best to do that. With a month to go until the Iowa caucuses, there's a clear top tier of four candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Ind. And they are all appealing to different portions of the party base. Biden has the support of older voters and African Americans; Sanders leads with progressives and young voters; and Warren appeals to highly educated whites and progressives, but she's competing with Buttigieg for college-educated whites and with Sanders for progressives. What's more, the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, in December, found some three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters say they could change their minds about who they support, which has made for a volatile race in the key early states. So what's the state of play a month out? How predictive are Iowa and New Hampshire for who becomes the Democratic nominee? And should we even pay attention to the polls this far out from the first two contests? Answers to those questions below: Biden In national polling, Biden has led from the beginning of the presidential campaign, but not with overwhelming support. Young liberals, in particular, reflexively don't like Biden, partly because of his writing of the 1990s crime bill and \u2014 for this presidential field, anyway \u2014 his moderate views. His at-times shaky debate performances have also worried his allies and supporters, but Biden has retained the support of older voters and black voters, who have been the backbone of his candidacy. Sanders People file in for a Bernie Sanders campaign event held in Newport, N.H., last year.\n                \n                    \n                    Cheryl Senter/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption People file in for a Bernie Sanders campaign event held in Newport, N.H., last year. Sanders is back after suffering a heart attack in early October, he's gaining in the polls, and he's maintained his ardent base of support. His army of volunteer organizers makes him a top contender in Iowa, where caucus activism is key to success. And remember, in 2016 he won the New Hampshire primary by 22 percentage points. The Granite State contest appears much closer this time, but Sanders can't be overlooked, especially since he's leading the field in fundraising, which means he's poised for a long fight \u2014 if it comes to that again. Warren In October, Warren looked like she was poised to run away with the nomination. But scrutiny of her support for \"Medicare for All\" appeared to hamper her chances. She eventually walked it back, identifying smaller health care measures she'd be willing to implement first. The struggle she faces is she's fighting a two-front battle. Warren needs to be boldly progressive to peel away Sanders supporters who might be open to someone else. But she needs to look like she can win to appeal to college-educated whites that Buttigieg has been peeling away from her. Buttigieg Buttigieg surged in late November, taking slight polling leads in Iowa and New Hampshire. He maintains a narrow lead in Iowa, but he's receded some in New Hampshire into a close second place. Buttigieg's glaring problem has been his inability to win over black voters. If he can't win them over, it's a near impossibility to win a Democratic nomination. If he were to win Iowa and New Hampshire, those are usually springboards that lead to more support with other coalitions. But if he were to win both and still not win over voters of color, that could mean the end for one or both of Iowa and New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation caucus and primary statuses. All four in the top tier are tightly bunched together in the two early states. Translation: The organizations of the candidates are going to matter on Election Day in both places.

Candidates hoping for a boost from the early states are Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. With a smaller debate stage, Klobuchar has been able to insert herself more into ideological tussles. She needs to do well in Iowa, as she's from a neighboring state, and she recently completed visits to all 99 of Iowa's counties. Booker boasts of his organization in Iowa. His campaign is hoping for something of a triple bank shot. It goes like this: He performs better than expected in Iowa, Biden collapses with worse-than-expected finishes in both states, black voters abandon Biden, and Booker picks up the pieces. That's a long shot, but that's the strategy. The most unconventional strategy, however, belongs to former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. Bloomberg has run more than $100 million in ads \u2014 so far \u2014 but he's not competing in Iowa or New Hampshire. That has never worked in a modern Democratic primary, but he, too, is also banking on a Biden implosion. Bloomberg hopes that his blitzing ad campaign can garner him enough votes \u2014 and delegates \u2014 to get him more prominently into the conversation, starting on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 15 states vote, including delegate-rich California and Texas.

The difficulty of not competing in the early states In the past 40 years, only one person has won the Democratic nomination without winning either Iowa or New Hampshire \u2014 Bill Clinton in 1992. But he competed in both states and lost to candidates who had something of home-field advantages. Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa won the Iowa caucuses that year, and the New Hampshire winner was Paul Tsongas of neighboring Massachusetts. Clinton was, in fact, able to declare something of a moral victory by finishing second in New Hampshire, and the media dubbed him the \"Comeback Kid\" for it.

Iowa has been more predictive overall than New Hampshire of who would become the Democratic nominee. In the past 40 years, seven of the last nine winners of Iowa's Democratic caucuses have gone on to become the nominee, including the last four. Five of the nine New Hampshire winners have. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Is polling this far out predictive of the winner of either state? As always, consumers of public opinion data should realize these surveys are snapshots in time. They are not always predictive of what will happen, nor are they intended to be. For instance, a month before the 2016 and 2008 Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries, the same person leading in the polls won the contest. But the numbers were very different than the final result. And in 2004, there was a completely different result in both states. In 2016 in Iowa, Clinton was up over Sanders by 6 points in the average of polls, but the trend line was clear. The gap was closing, and on Election Day, Sanders and Clinton essentially tied in the final result, with Clinton edging Sanders by just 0.3 percentage points. In New Hampshire, Sanders led by an average of 5 points but wound up winning by 22. Polling essentially tracked Sanders' widening lead in that month. Barack Obama campaigns in Iowa in October 2007. Iowa was an important launching pad for Obama that helped him win the Democratic nomination in 2008.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Barack Obama campaigns in Iowa in October 2007. Iowa was an important launching pad for Obama that helped him win the Democratic nomination in 2008. In 2008, Barack Obama led by just 0.3 percentage points in an average of the polls in Iowa but wound up winning by 8. In New Hampshire, it was a quirkier story. A month before the primary, Clinton led by an average of 9 points and wound up winning by 3, but not before lots of volatility in that month. With Obama's win in Iowa, the numbers changed quickly. By Election Day in New Hampshire, Obama was up 8 in Granite State polls, and his victory looked all but assured. But then \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 Clinton pulled out the victory. And then in 2004, a Pew poll a month before the caucuses had former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean up substantially in both states. Former Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry eventually won the Iowa caucuses by 6 points after being down 11 in that survey. Kerry also wound up winning New Hampshire by 13 points despite being down in that Pew poll by 14. So with a Democratic primary field as undecided as this one, almost anything can happen. Be prepared for some surprises.",
