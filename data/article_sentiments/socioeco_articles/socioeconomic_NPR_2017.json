President Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos, struck a defiant tone in brief remarks before conservative activists at a political conference outside Washington, D.C., on Thursday. But she held back on the administration's rescinding of Obama administration guidance to schools on transgender rights. \"This issue was a very huge example of Obama administration overreach, one-size-fits-all approach to issues best solved at personal and local level,\" DeVos told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC. DeVos added that she and the Trump administration have \"made clear, it's our job to protect students and teachers' flexibility and protect and preserve personal freedoms.\" There were reported tensions between DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the joint decision made to rescind the Obama administration guidance that had required schools wanting to receive federal funding to allow transgender students to use bathrooms, locker rooms and participate on athletic teams corresponding with the gender with which they identified \u2014 rather than their gender at birth. DeVos reportedly was uncomfortable with earlier draft language and wanted to stress protections for transgender students. That was reinforced with a DeVos statement put out separately from the joint letter with Sessions, in which DeVos stressed: \"We have a responsibility to protect every student in America and ensure that they have the freedom to learn and thrive in a safe and trusted environment. This is not merely a federal mandate, but a moral obligation no individual, school, district or state can abdicate. At my direction, the Department's Office for Civil Rights remains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools. ... I consider protecting all students, including LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America.\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday that there was \"no daylight\" between the president, Sessions or DeVos but that \"there has been some discussion between the timing of the issuance and recommendations, or between the exact wording.\" DeVos squeaked through the confirmation process, and in those hearings, she disavowed conversion therapy, which her family has invested in. Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota asked about it. \"I have never believed in that,\" she said, adding, \"I fully embrace equality, and I believe in the innate value of every single human being, and that all students, no matter their age, should be able to attend a school and feel safe and be free of discrimination.\" Earlier in her speech, DeVos struck an ideological tone about education. She took aim at the media and liberals, calling herself the \"first person to tell Bernie Sanders to his face, there's no such thing as a free lunch.\" That was meant to draw laughs from the conservative activists, but low-income schools, known as Title I schools, provide free and reduced lunches and breakfasts to low socioeconomic students. As of 2012, 31 million children benefited from the National School Lunch program. The National School Lunch Act was signed by President Truman in 1946. \"The media has had its fun with me,\" DeVos said, noting, however, \"my job isn't to win popularity contests\" with the media or the \"Washington education establishment.\" She criticized $7 billion in school grants given out by the Obama Education Department. She said that administration thought \"money alone would solve the problem. They tested their model and failed miserably.\" She also spoke out against university administrators and professors \"telling you what to think.\" She said the \"real threat is silencing people with whom you disagree.\" The University of California, Berkeley drew Trump's tweeting ire after protesters blocked Milo Yiannopoulos, the controversial former Breitbart editor, from speaking there. But he is the same speaker CPAC disinvited after video surfaced of him seeming to defend pedophilia. DeVos praised \"good teachers\" and said they should be paid accordingly, but she blasted \"defenders of the status quo.\" Teachers unions were vociferously against DeVos' nomination.

            "article_content": "In his new book, Matinee: All Ages On The Bowery, Drew Carolan presents his portraits of the Bowery hardcore kids of the mid-'80s ... the boots, leather, patches, buzzed heads and middle fingers. Below, we learn what they've been up to since. Turn any corner in New York City and you are bound to discover something you have never seen before. What started out as a curiosity one late night in 1981 in the East Village turned into an ongoing photographic expos\u00e9 on a thriving subculture, 30-odd years later. Utilizing what I learned from Richard Avedon while working on his seminal book, In The American West, for two years, I stood on the eastern end of Bleecker Street, where it empties into what was the most famous street for the downtrodden, disenfranchised and destitute \u2014 the Bowery. CBGB's was the perfect place for young outcasts, free thinkers and activists to gather under one roof \u2014 it was there that I intercepted patrons on their way to congregate and participate in a weekly ritual: the venue's all-ages, hardcore punk matinee. Dozens upon dozens of people, mostly teenagers, were photographed against a white piece of seamless paper. As the project evolved, the setting remained the same. I would shoot for a couple of hours on the street and then pack up my stuff and head over to the club and witness a congregation of kids set free to express themselves however they decided. It was sheer joy, in the most juvenile way. Kids bouncing off each other like pinballs \u2014 moshing and skanking, working it all out. When the shows were over, they would grab pitchers of water off the bar to hydrate before hitting the street. After processing and contacting the film, I would sit and look at the pictures and make choices of the ones that spoke to me. Those chosen were put up on the wall for further inspection. These two-dimensional photographs became little icons to me. They represented angst, freedom, sexuality and the coming of age, all wrapped into one. But who were these kids hanging on my wall? Where are they now? Who have they become? With the advent of the Internet and search engines, reproducing these images and contacting people became simple. An email out of the blue, from Andy in 2006, reopened a dialogue. Suddenly the two-dimensional icons came to life. Beyond just knowing many of their names, stories of triumph and failure came. The third dimension presented itself \u2014 the history of these individuals and the true meaning of their existence, after all those years. \u2014 Drew Carolan Mark\n                \n                    \n                    Kathryn Stone\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mark I can say this with the utmost certainty: Finding this music and these people completely saved my life. The majority of kids hanging out during this era, the still-burgeoning hardcore punk scene, came from poor or, if they were lucky, lower-middle-class backgrounds. Regardless of socioeconomic status, most of these kids came from broken homes \u2014 often the victims of physical abuse. Hardcore punk showed us a path to channel our anger, despair and depression into something raw and vital. We were able to express ourselves by creating lasting art and music and connecting with all kinds of people that shared similar experiences; all of the trauma and emotions that were trapped in our bodies and weighing us down, that no amount of talking or therapy could have helped us with, even if we had access to such things at the time. My life today consists of nonstop work at my restaurant. Because of location and time, I don't get to as many shows as I once did, but I will always be connected. I left downtown Manhattan in 2013 and headed north to Dover, in the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire, to open a restaurant and cocktail bar, Sonny's Tavern, with two of my close friends.

I was not taking pictures myself when this was shot \u2014 I did other kinds of art. I never became a full-fledged member of the hardcore scene, but eventually was going to shows at night at CBs and all over the city \u2014 punk, rock 'n' roll and soul were my life. I had so much fun \u2014 like I'll never have again. I dropped out of high school because I was going out so much. I'll never regret those times. Now I'm doing a lot of political volunteering; I've always been about politics. Was raised that way, and punk allowed me to express that lefty social justice aspect as well as just be irreverent. I'll never stop being a feminist, an agitator for justice for the oppressed, and I guess that means I'm still a punk. Currently listening to: The Carvels, King Khan and The BBQ Show, OFF! In hindsight, I think that my early adolescent treks from Staten Island to the Bowery to catch the weekly matinee at CBGB's may have been training me to spend my life on the road. After getting out of university I started traveling more seriously, eventually expatriating when I was 24. Since then, I've probably spent half my life living overseas, working mostly as a journalist and travel writer in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. I have a new book coming out in 2018 \u2014 my 14th \u2014 titled Formosa Moon and have recently switched from original Star Trek \"continuing journey\" mode to a more Deep Space Nine mode by hooking up with a Taiwanese travel company that does custom tours around the country. It kind of fits, in a weird way. There's a decent punk scene here, and Beijing calls us a renegade province, so yeah, there's that.

Currently listening to: Kou Chou Ching, The White Eyes, Frank Zappa, Gentle Giant, Yes, Bad Brains, The Germs, Black Flag, Minor Threat We did a lot of crazy things when we were younger.

I was able to buy a home and raise my son in a stable environment \u2014 and, of course, I still love to hang with my hardcore family at shows. Nothing beats the energy and fun of moshing it up.

I've never used alcohol, tobacco, drugs or coffee \u2014 and never will! I mostly listen to a lot of the same hardcore music I did as a teenager. ... I haven't heard anything better to listen to yet. My favorite band is the Dickies, who have been around since the late '70s (but I didn't discover them until I was in the police academy). They were too \"punk\" for me in the '80s. ... I had to mature into them. Currently listening to: The radio in the car, but I'm not a fan of most of the music I hear on it. Occasionally I'll hear a catchy tune, but I don't like any current bands out there now. I moved to Berlin in '91, have one daughter, Kaya, who is 24, and a son, Dexter, who is 11. I moved to Munich from Berlin in 2000, and play in a primitive s***-rock garage-punk duo called LOOSE with my boyfriend, Lex. For money, I work as a visual merchandiser. I live clean and eat clean, I still question authority and I always strive to seek what's authentic and deeper than what we are taught to believe is of worth in this material world. I believe it is my duty to pass these ways down to my children. My musical tastes have changed very little since I have been listening to music as a kid. Currently listening to: The Black Jaspers, Queens Of The Stone Age, OFF!. I've got a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering; I've worked for the U.S. Navy for almost 23 years, with 15 of those spent \"keeping the water out of the people tank\" on submarines, and working on launch systems. I reconcile working for the war machine with my lefty peacenik values as \u2014 at least, until this last election \u2014 we were the good guys, and we need a Navy. I'll happily be the first on the unemployment line when we don't need a Navy, but for now I work to keep our sailors and Marines safe. These days, I run internships for high school and college kids at Navy labs as well as independent research programs at the warfare centers. I've also started a rogue mentoring program to help Navy engineers and scientists, mostly women, achieve their career goals. I suppose that's my passion. That and my dogs.

It was amateurish, poorly produced and poorly performed \u2014 and I played it all night. Somehow, this music spoke to me in a life-changing way. ... It showed me that things didn't need to be perfect. I had been looking at music the wrong way. It's not about attaining perfection, but rather attaining a feeling. In 1981, I found the New York hardcore scene through a friend of a friend. (It was very hard to find; you had to want it. The scene was very insular and protective of its own.) Back than, you could buy a demo tape or a sticker or maybe a compilation album, but that was it. We found or made our own clothes, painted our jackets or magic-markered our band shirts. I found drugs and alcohol, and left the drugs. By 1985, I just couldn't get a life started in New York, while the scene was becoming a little frat-boyish and cliquey, so I packed up my motorcycle and left New York for an adventure. I first stopped in West Philadelphia and worked security for punk shows at The Crypt, Club Pizzazz and The Trocadero. The transformation from punk to biker was easy and natural; I managed to open a motorcycle shop in San Francisco.

I think most of what the bands sang about back then has either come true or remains relevant. Through punk and hardcore, New York was a vibrant and exciting place to be back then. ... I don't like what the city has become now. I worked in the entertainment industry for over 25 years, mostly in television and video production, and left New York after living on St. Marks for years, moving to the mountains and serenity of New England. I've been doing mostly carpentry and renovation these days. Currently listening to: A lot of Afro-Cuban jazz, late-'60s skinhead reggae, ska and mod music, '80s post-punk and The Clash Life has been good for this survivor \u2014 I'm still here!

I did this from age 14 until 18, when I moved to downtown New York. I was the bassist from the original Death Before Dishonor and Judge. I left Judge because I wanted to focus on my artwork; I went to The School of Visual Arts in New York City. My art was focused on Chan (Zen). After my punk days, I became a Zen Buddhist monk \u2014 when I left monasticism, hoping to help more people, I very naturally went into Buddhist studies and social work. Now I'm a professor of Buddhist studies. I don't see myself pursuing [education] beyond a Ph.D \u2014 education in general, however, is a lifetime process, and I'm continuing to learn to help myself, others, the world, in my own way. My life now is focused on helping people through the practice of Chan, or Zen [Buddhism]. I learned meditation when I was very young as a boy, so it was very natural for me to go back to my roots.

President Robert Mugabe and his family are \"safe and sound,\" according to Zimbabwe's military \u2014 but his decades in power are seemingly at an end, after Mugabe, 93, was forcefully pushed aside. Both the ruling party and the military insist there was no coup. \"We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country in order to bring them to justice,\" the Zimbabwe Defense Forces said on Wednesday, adding, \"As soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy.\" But it will be a new normal for Zimbabwe, which has been led by Mugabe since the 1980s. The dramatic shift comes a week after Mugabe fired longtime Vice President (and military veteran) Emmerson Mnangagwa, accusing him of disloyalty. That seemed to be the last straw for the military, which sent armored vehicles and soldiers on street patrols in the capital. As we reported, \"Soldiers reportedly took control of the headquarters of the national broadcaster, ZBC, with an army spokesman saying on air, 'this is not a military takeover.' \" On Wednesday morning, an account purporting to belong to the ruling ZANU-PF party tweeted that Mnangagwa has now returned to lead the party: Last night the first family was detained and are safe, both for the constitution and the sanity of the nation this was necessary. Neither Zimbabwe nor ZANU are owned by Mugabe and his wife. Today begins a fresh new era and comrade Mnangagwa will help us achieve a better Zimbabwe. \"Last night the first family was detained and are safe, both for the constitution and the sanity of the nation this was necessary. Neither Zimbabwe nor ZANU are owned by Mugabe and his wife. Today begins a fresh new era and comrade Mnangagwa will help us achieve a better Zimbabwe.\" Both the ouster and the presence of heavy military vehicles on the streets of Harare fueled talk of a coup in Zimbabwe \u2014 which in turn fueled denials by the military and ruling party. \"Contrary to international reports, the gallant Zimbabwean Army has not staged a COUP,\" the ZANU PF party's youth league said on Twitter, in a message retweeted by the main party. It added, \"There is n COUP in Zimbabwe. Neither is there crisis. The army is simply effecting a National Democratic Project and it's doing so with peaceful aplomb.\" Contrary to international reports, the gallant Zimbabwean Army has not staged a COUP. There is n COUP in Zimbabwe. Neither is there crisis.The army is simply effecting a National Democratic Project and it's doing so with peaceful aplomb. The African Union is calling on all sides to respect Zimbabwe's democracy and human rights, as well as its socioeconomic development. African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat \"is closely following the developments in Zimbabwe,\" the organization said. A public schism had formed between Mugabe and Mnangagwa at least as early as the summer of 2016, when veterans of Zimbabwe's war of liberation withdrew their support for Mugabe. In a letter explaining that move, the veterans cited widespread corruption and mismanagement in the government, stating, \"This rot needs to be uprooted, and right now.\" The schism resulted in two camps forming \u2014 one loyal to Mnangagwa and another loyal to Mugabe's wife, Grace, NPR's Merrit Kennedy reported. Many saw Mnangagwa's removal \"as a prelude to Mugabe promoting the politically ambitious but controversial first lady to one of two vice presidential posts,\" NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton and Scott Neuman reported earlier Wednesday. When Mugabe fired his deputy Mnangagwa, it triggered a stern warning from the military. As NPR's Eyder Peralta reports for our Newscast unit from Kenya, the military said that if a purge of revolutionary fighters continued, it would take action: \"Last night, the military did. Armored vehicles moved through the streets of the capital Harare and this morning state TV aired an address by Major General Sibusiso Moyo. \"He says Mugabe is safe, but the military wants to end the quote purging. \" 'We are against that act of injustice and we intend to protect every one of you against that,' Moyo said.\" Mugabe's five-year term in office was meant to run into 2018; new elections had been expected to be held next summer. Mugabe became Zimbabwe's prime minister in 1980 and assumed the president's office in 1987, after the exit of Zimbabwe's first president, Canaan Banana.",

But for Ta-Nehisi Coates, it all comes down to race. \"[Trump's] ideology is white supremacy, in all its truculent and sanctimonious power,\" Coates writes in an essay for The Atlantic, adapted from his upcoming book, We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy. Coates spoke to Rachel Martin of Morning Edition about that essay, which will be featured in the Atlantic's October issue. The conversation focuses on why Coates thinks that Trump's election was a direct response to having a black man occupy an office that was, up until Barack Obama, \"reserved for white men.\" The interview has been edited and condensed. You don't buy the argument that Donald Trump's election was about the white working class in America feeling marginalized from a globalized workforce, from a globalized economy that had left them behind \u2014 and that that's what was animating that demographic. Well, you know, it's certainly true that the white working class feels that way. But anybody who wants to make a class-based argument must explain why the black working class, the Latino working class, didn't break the same way. They are just as afflicted by forces of globalization and economic change, deindustrialization, et cetera. And yet they didn't break to Trump. The other thing that has to be explained is why Trump was dominant across nearly every socio-economic sector of white America. It was not simply that he rose on the strength of the white working class. He rose on the strength of all of white America. Some people look at those sectors that you just talked about and say, \"Well, they weren't motivated by race in this\" or \"They were OK electing and supporting a presidential candidate, whom many believe was propagating racist policies.\" Weren't they just voting on their interests, which do not include race relations in this country? Yeah. I would definitely agree with that. And I would argue, I think there's something behind even saying that \"race relations\" aren't their interest. I think that's a statement itself. Race relations are interested in them, whether they're interested in it or not. Well, I guess that's what I'm pointing out, is that race would be something that would be more at the forefront of the people who are being marginalized by what are called \"racist policies,\" and so maybe that's a problem. But it is the world we live in that whites don't recognize racism in this country as something that would be an animating force in their electoral decisions. I would agree with that. I would just add that I don't think that's exonerating. For instance, I think if you say, \"Well yeah, Donald Trump ran a racist campaign, but I voted for him despite that,\" that is to say that having somebody who runs that type of campaign is not a disqualifier to you. You don't let anyone off the hook in this piece. You and I have talked before about how you think even President Obama, to a degree, downplayed racial divides and talked instead about economic injustices that face all Americans regardless of race. But you also in this piece call out Bernie Sanders, and to a lesser degree Hillary Clinton, for doing the same thing. You believe the political left in this country is also complicit. I do. I think there is a long tradition in this country of evasion. I mean, David Duke, a former Klansman who was running for office in Louisiana, was very, very successful. And folks say they say the exact same thing about that, that they say today: \"Oh, it's economic distress.\" Clearly a lot of people here felt left behind economically. That's why folks were so moved to be represented by a Klansman. And there's a broad agreement, I would say, across the Democratic Party from folks who are more centrist like Obama and Clinton, and folks who are further left like Bernie Sanders, that the real issue is actually economics \u2014 that there isn't some bastion of racism to be found in the white working class. And I don't think there's a particular one to be found in a white working class. I think there's a particular one to be found in white America in general. So you've outlined a situation in which there don't seem to be any saviors. No existing party or movement that gets us out of this situation to rescue us, essentially, from the racial divides that seem to be deepening. That is a sad indictment. How do you \u2014 because it is human nature to try to look toward some kind of light \u2014 where do you see the light? Where do you see a moment, or a way out? I don't think I do. We have some you know some 400 years of history weighing down on us, going all the way back to colonial times when black folks first arrived here in 1619. We have not figured out a way to really pay down that debt to get that history up off of us. And so I think the expectation at some moment will happen now is, forgive me, a bit naive. How do you raise kids in that? I mean you've written an entire book dedicated to your son addressing this very issue; but how do you \u2014 I mean when the future is that bleak when the present and the future are that bleak? I think quite easily. Life is always a problem. The fact that I'm on the radio saying that I don't necessarily see hope does not relieve people, does not relieve my son, does not relieve children, of the responsibility to struggle. Folks struggled in much bleaker times than this. So to me, the answer to that is the same answer to how we got here in the first place. It's history. If you look at how human beings have been throughout history, during bleak times, they've struggled. Why would it be any different this time?",

The community is struggling with how to build a sustainable economy while preserving the culture and environment of the reservation. Ernest Littlebird put his grill out on the side of Route 39 in Lame Deer, Mont., under the shade of a tree and started grilling hamburgers. \"Come get a dollar burger,\" he says. \"Good meal, you know, something to put in the belly at least.\" Littlebird is an entrepreneur. This is his second year selling dollar hamburgers out of his minivan when he couldn't find other work. Jobs are scarce here on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation and so is money. But Littlebird thinks they don't have to be. When he can't find work, Ernest Littlebird makes his own, selling hamburgers for a dollar along Route 39 just near Lame Deer, Mont. \"We've got to do something,\" he says of the tribal economy.\n                \n                    \n                    Shane Thomas McMillan for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Northern Cheyenne Reservation sits on one of the richest coal deposits in the country. There are billions of tons of the black rock buried underneath Littlebird, Lame Deer and the surrounding pine-dotted prairie. In some places, it's so easy to access that coal developers have told tribal members it could be scraped up with a spoon. But despite high unemployment and systemic poverty, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe has never touched the coal. It has spurned developers and scuttled plans. Most recently, it sued the Trump administration for opening up the opportunity for new coal development in its corner of southeastern Montana. The land here is sacred to the tribe. Retaining culture is crucial. And tribal leadership says it's committed to finding long-term economic opportunities for its members, not the boom-and-bust cycle of extractive industry. But with the Trump administration pushing for new coal development, some on the reservation are wondering whether the tribe should finally cash in on the resources buried beneath their feet. \"We've got to do something,\" Littlebird says. Diana McLean says coal would be good for the North Cheyenne Tribe. \"We've been in the same situation for the last 50 years. And it hasn't changed. It hasn't improved.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Shane Thomas McMillan for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Diana McLean says coal would be good for the North Cheyenne Tribe. \"We've been in the same situation for the last 50 years. And it hasn't changed. It hasn't improved.\" Farther down the road, Diana McLean, a tribal member, waves at the land and the nearby homes. She says coal would be good for the community. \"We need the economic development. We need the jobs here,\" she says. \"We've been in the same situation for the last 50 years. And it hasn't changed. It hasn't improved. There's no jobs here.\" Unemployment on the Northern Cheyenne About 5,000 people live on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, and according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the unemployment rate is about 24 percent. The Bureau of Indian Affairs says it's closer to 60 percent. The tribe's former economic development officer, Steve Small and many other people you talk to here think the unemployment rate is even higher than that. \"I'd say about 10 percent of us have jobs,\" Small says, in an office just outside Lame Deer. \"I'm sure people would be out there working if we had jobs, but we don't.\" The former point person for economic development for the tribal government, Steve Small, talks with client Roman Fisher in his office. Small sees coal as the only way to really improve the economic situation of the Northern Cheyenne people.\n                \n                    \n                    Shane Thomas McMillan for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A high unemployment rate has led to high rates of alcoholism, drug abuse and suicide \u2014 the symptoms of poverty. Small says people here are tired of it. That is why he says he would like to see the tribe develop the estimated 23 billion tons of coal that lie underneath the reservation. Development would bring jobs, which would bring a sense of self-worth, he says. \"You know culture is really nice and I love my culture, but it doesn't put food on the table,\" Small says. As he is talking though, his secretary, who is standing next to the door, starts to shake her head. She disagrees completely. \"I'm concerned about the destruction of our water, our air, our safety for our children and women because of the influx of people that would come into our community,\" says Alaina Buffalo Spirit. \"So it brings in money. Guess what? More drugs, more alcohol, human trafficking.\" What's more, she says, \"coal is dead. There's no economy for it.\" Many locals in Lame Deer point to the red band of rocks on the hillsides around the town, saying that the formations are a reminder of the coal underneath their community.\n                \n                    \n                    Shane Thomas McMillan for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Surrounded by coal The Northern Cheyenne Reservation is in the upper part of the Powder River Basin, which is the source of about 40 percent of the nation's coal supply. The tribe is surrounded by coal development. But in recent years, as America's energy system has shifted increasingly toward natural gas and renewable energy sources, the neighboring coal communities have suffered setbacks. Hundreds of workers have been laid off on the Crow Reservation. Real estate values have plummeted in a coal town to the north, where lawsuits are forcing a forthcoming closure of half of the town's coal-fired power plant. There is hope in those places and on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation that President Trump and his push to do away with Obama-era environmental regulations will stop the bleeding and help bring the coal economy back. \"He's for development. He's trying to create jobs,\" says Leroy Spang, a former president of the Northern Cheyenne tribe and a retired coal miner. \"But I don't trust that guy.\" Tribal housing authority workers Neil Beartusk (left) and Kevin Mason hang a piece of artwork in the Cheyenne Commerce Center.

He served as the tribe's president from 2008 to 2012, and he worked hard to bring coal development to the reservation during that time. He looked to other tribes like the Southern Ute, in Colorado, for advice on how best to start developing a natural resource. It wasn't the first time the tribe had seriously considered mining its resources. Coal companies have been courting the Northern Cheyenne for decades. And they've always left disappointed. Spang's tenure was no different. He projected it would take 10 years and hundreds of millions of dollars for coal development to get going on Northern Cheyenne, but he couldn't get a project off the ground. Some members of the tribal council resisted his efforts, and a slowing demand and market for coal didn't help his cause. Now, Spang says, with coal being phased out domestically, he fears it might be too late. \"If you can't sell it, you can't dig it,\" he says. Someday, he thinks, that will change. The coal will eventually be mined, he says, because it's a valuable resource. But it won't be anytime soon. \"We are the ancestors of those who resisted.\" Jace Killsback, the current president of the Northern Cheyenne tribe, would like to see the coal never leave the ground. \"I have a cultural worldview that is opposed to the destruction of our land,\" he says. That worldview is one he shares with many in the tribe \u2014 the more traditional members, who are wont to point out that their ancestors died procuring this land. Northern Cheyenne Tribe President Jace Killsback says allowing coal excavation would be deeply destructive to the tribe's culture. \"We are the ancestors of those who resisted,\" he says.\n                \n                    \n                    Shane Thomas McMillan for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption It was the Northern Cheyenne who helped kill Gen. George Armstrong Custer back in 1876. And it was their leaders who fought the U.S. government's orders to move south to Oklahoma. They battled their way back north to Montana and what would eventually become the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. \"We are the ancestors of those who resisted,\" Killsback says. And he says he intends to keep it that way. Earlier this year, the Northern Cheyenne sued the Trump administration for its decision to end an Obama-era moratorium on coal leasing. The tribe, he says, should have been consulted before that decision was made because it will have a direct impact on them. Consultation, he says, is a treaty right that was established between the tribe and the U.S. government. With the moratorium gone, the government can begin leasing federal lands for new coal development. And Killsback expects some of those leases will be near his reservation's borders. The problems, he says, could be many. He has concerns about air and water pollution, heavy traffic from semitrucks and a surge in outsiders moving into the area. \"We want to have a say in how a coal lease is given out next to a reservation and how it will impact our communities,\" he says.

He and others who run the shop believe the tribe should focus on supporting entrepreneurs and leave the coal under the reservation in the ground.\n                \n                    \n                    Shane Thomas McMillan for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The lawsuit against the Trump administration raised some eyebrows on the reservation. Some worry it could draw repercussions. The Northern Cheyenne, like many tribes, receives federal money. And without another independent revenue stream, it is largely dependent on those funds. This is a point many pro-coal people on the reservation make for development: The tribe would have more independence and flexibility if it wasn't so tied to federal money. Killsback is concerned about that too, but he doesn't see coal as the solution. He would like to see the tribe attract other industry like clean energy or e-commerce. His administration is helping launch small, Northern Cheyenne-owned businesses. Off of Route 39, the main road through Lame Deer, not far from where Littlebird sells his hamburgers is a new shopping center. There is an art store, a print shop and cellphone repair shop among others. Brandin Limberhand is opening the cellphone repair shop with a friend. It's the only one in 120 miles. \"We can find a better solution to create jobs \u2014 more jobs, different jobs \u2014 on this reservation,\" Limberhand says. \"Coal makes money and all that, but it impacts our land and our people. We can do better.\" The debate in Lame Deer, Mont., and the rest of the reservation comes down the ground: Can what is underneath save the Northern Cheyenne or is it best to preserve the land their ancestors fought for?\n                \n                    \n                    Shane Thomas McMillan for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption",

And that has prompted almost daily street protests by thousands of Venezuelans. Here opposition activists march on the Francisco Fajardo Highway in Caracas on June 19. Venezuela's ongoing political and economic crisis has taken a toll on daily life there. A crash in oil prices and political instability under President Nicolas Maduro have led to food shortages, and that has prompted almost daily street protests by thousands of Venezuelans. A 35-year-old protester named Carlos tells NPR's Audie Cornish the food situation is \"pretty extreme.\" NPR is using only his first name for his safety. \"I cannot find basic food: no rice, no chicken. Fruits are very expensive. So what has really shocked me is that this past year, you can see on every street of the city, there is someone in the garbage looking for food,\" he says. Carlos had been a tour guide until the spring, when he joined the opposition protesters, which the government considers enemies of the state. With the collapse of the economy, Carlos says tourism has pretty much dried up. These days the protests in Caracas \u2014 Venezuela's capital \u2014 are practically his full-time job. As described by Carlos, the protests are extremely organized. Protesters, he says, are divided into levels. \"There's level 1 to 7,\" he says. Level 1 protesters are up front, face-to-face with police. People call them warriors. \"These are kids, most of them under 25, which are students most of them \u2014 or they have nothing to lose, they don't have a job, they don't see a future and they fight for their life,\" he says. Carlos mostly hovers in the second wave of the protest. He says these are people who help with logistics. There, he passes out water and snacks and pours Maalox over the faces of protesters who are weeping with tear gas. He gets the food through a network of people who operate more or less anonymously, sharing information through messaging apps about drop-off points and pickup spots where they are hiding supplies. Opposition activists clash with riot police during a demonstration against the government of President Nicolas Maduro along the Francisco Fajardo Highway in Caracas on June 19.\n                \n                    \n                    Juan Barreto/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Opposition activists clash with riot police during a demonstration against the government of President Nicolas Maduro along the Francisco Fajardo Highway in Caracas on June 19. \"It's like a war. There are soldiers, there's [logistics], there's intelligence. It's like a Cold War as well because we're hiding,\" he says. \"I'm walking down the street, and I'm scared some policeman might [catch] me because now if you have a helmet in your car or a baseball hat of the flag of Venezuela \u2014 which is like the symbol of the protest \u2014 they can put you in jail.\" More than 70 people have died in protests that have roiled the country since April, after Venezuela's Supreme Court moved to dissolve the National Assembly. And the protests have taken on new urgency now that Maduro has plans to rewrite the country's constitution. Protesters believe he's trying to cement his hold on power. Carlos says protesters want new elections, the release of political prisoners and access to humanitarian aid. Shannon O'Neil, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, tells NPR that Maduro has the support of between 20 and 25 percent of Venezuelans. Many, she says, are people who are getting baskets of food through a program arranged by the government. \"There is this base of support, though we have seen it eroding as this crisis gets worse,\" she says. The U.S. has issued sanctions on Venezuelan leaders and has reached out to other countries in the region to try to bring together a coalition to push for change. But, as O'Neill says, such moves can bolster Maduro's anti-U.S. rhetoric. In a televised speech last month, Maduro said to \"go home, Donald Trump. Get out of Venezuela, Donald Trump. Enough interventionism.\" \"That rallies his loyal followers. If you can blame the problems of Venezuela today not on your policies but on the United States, it serves him well,\" O'Neill says. She says some people hope the government will collapse \u2014 and others fear it because that could lead to more economic hardship \u2014 and a refugee crisis. \"We've already seen tens of thousands of Venezuelans flee to neighboring countries to look for a better life, to get basic health care, to find food, and there's a worry that you could see those levels increase dramatically if Venezuela and the government collapse.\" The number of Venezuelans seeking asylum in the U.S. has more than doubled in the past year.

Atlanta eats its young. That might be a cold-blooded accusation to level at a town dripping with so much black cultural currency. But the hip-hop capital has gained more than it's ever contributed to its greatest export. Welcome to the city too player to hate. Where a handful of Dungeon dragons gave birth to an extended Family \u2014 from Goodie Mob and OutKast to Killer Mike and Future \u2014 that permanently shifted hip-hop's center of gravity. Where the trap transformed from literal dead-end to hypothetical escape route for the discarded and forgotten. Where a generation left to its own digital devices created a content craze by teaching the world to Dab, Whip, Drop that Nae Nae, Hit Them Folks and Whoop Rico. Like music to capitalism's ears, these are the signs of a sonic identity 20 years in the making. Meanwhile, the city continues to reinvent itself for the sake of outward appearances. Now it's the Hollywood of the South. Next it's the Silicon Valley of the South. But the one thing Atlanta has consistently been, the hip-hop pedigree that's kept its international flame perennially lit, still gets the shaft on the low. Consider this irony: Donald Glover's celebrated FX show Atlanta, which earned record ratings and Golden Globe statues following its debut season, received Georgia film tax incentives legislated within the last decade to lure film and TV production to the Peach State. Yet the twice-as-old, homegrown music industry, on which the show's plot is centered, still runs off an ecosystem largely unsupported by state funding or investment from the city's civic and corporate communities. The resulting failure to leverage this global cultural cachet suggests too many people in high places don't fully understand, appreciate or respect the value of hip-hop as an economic growth engine. While local politicos and power brokers look outside the city for world-class inspiration, they often overlook the one thing the rest of the world looks to Atlanta for. In the last two months alone, a steady stream of mainstream dominance has kept all eyes on the ATL: Migos popped the top of the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Bad and Boujee\" and the group's album, C U L T U R E, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Future became the first solo artist in history to release two albums that debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in back-to-back weeks. Lil Yachty added a major Target endorsement \u2014 and the longest commercial aired during the Grammy Awards' February broadcast \u2014 to his portfolio. 21 Savage signed a deal with Epic Records, where CEO L.A. Reid continues to corral talent fresh from the southern city where he co-founded the now-defunct LaFace Records a quarter century ago. And the latest virtual unknown to continue Atlanta's streak of seemingly overnight phenoms is newcomer SahBabii, who spits melodies so tender they belie the explicit reality he represents. His seductive street anthem \"Pull Up Wit Ah Stick\" \u2014 slang for a semi-automatic weapon \u2014 serves as a subtle reminder of Atlanta's national ranking as the city with the highest gap between the rich and poor. Like the rose that grew from concrete, it's the shameful little secret buried in Georgia's red clay. And the resulting divide is the basis of a culture war being waged over the city's most fetishized and stigmatized commodity. The rise of Traplanta is the untold story of a city split in half by historic income inequality, shifting racial demographics, and an equally enigmatic identity crisis. The irony, of course, is how that inequity has helped to cultivate a trap-rap innovation economy from which Atlanta perpetually feeds. \"Young rich n*****, you know we ain't really never had no old money. We got a whole lotta new money, though.\" \u2014 Migos, \"Bad and Boujee\" One month after Donald Glover made Migos a household name, two of the trio's members \u2014 Quavo and Takeoff \u2014 found themselves receiving another honorable distinction. A flier circulating on the web suggested the rappers were scheduled to school New York University on the subject of culture. The ratchet Dab daddies who made the dance they created so ubiquitous it earned copycats Cam Newton and Hillary Clinton equal amounts of contempt were set to take on the halls of the academy. It sounded too good to miss. Hip-hop in 2017 is certainly no stranger to academia. This semester alone has already seen the introduction of popular new courses on Georgia college campuses covering the trap and OutKast, alike. But Migos' members didn't subject themselves to two hours of Q&A at NYU to earn the academy's praise. They did it for the C U L T U R E LP. A twist on the typical release party, the event was part of the rollout campaign, produced by New York-based music marketing firm NUE Agency, that helped them achieve their first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. It only took ten minutes for Migos' CULTURECLASS at NYU's Cantor Center to morph into laugh-out-loud absurdity. Curious about Migos' effortless ability to stride the line between culture and commerce, Julie Anne Quay \u2014 the stylish founder of fashion-forward social media hub VFiles \u2014 asked: \"How is cash a fashion statement, and is there a duffle bag full of cash nearby right now?\" Taking it as a cue to turn up, Quavo responded in kind: \"There's a pocket nearby,\" he said, pulling out an obscene stash of stacks like a magician retrieving a rabbit from his hat. \"Yo,\" a guy in third row laughed as cheers erupted from the capacity-crowd of 315 students and press, \"pass some this way!\" If OutKast represents the hope of Atlantis, a destination equal parts real and phantasmic, the music fertilized by Atlanta drug traps signifies the forgotten stepchild complicating the city's purported legacy of black wealth and equal opportunity. Borne of a turn-of-the-millennium wave that shot T.I. to superstardom, trap music's original incarnation crested with the likes of Jeezy and Gucci Mane. Today the subgenre barely resembles the dope-boy struggles of its predecessors. New age flavors range from 21 Savage's morose flows to Rae Sremmurd's pop-trap anthems to the trippy psychedelia of Young Thug. The main difference: Trappers today are as likely to rap about using drugs as they are selling them. Still, trap largely reflects the other extreme within Atlanta's hip-hop binary and, by extension, solidifies the long-told tale of two cities\u2014one prosperous, the other impoverished. Yet it's trap that has succeeded in creating an ecosystem that makes the world turn up. Even in a city like Atlanta where black cool is a proven commodity, leveraging hip-hop's hustle has been a trying proposition. ChooseATL, the branding campaign launched by the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, uses the city's hip-hop swag to market Atlanta as a premier destination for tech-savvy millennials and entrepreneurs. But the well-heeled corporate community it represents maintains an arm's-length distance from many of the culture's most marketable artists. \"People are scared of the young black creative,\" says Wil May, the founder of Atlanta-based lifestyle, media, and hospitality company #COOL. \"That's really frightening to America's way of doing business.\" An Emory University alum who once was roommates with Justin Bieber's manager Scooter Braun, May's own evolution from rapper/producer to creative entrepreneur has given him the advantage of both angles. \"It's obvious that people don't want to empower hip-hop on a civic or global level because they feel like it's too dirty or too street or uplifts criminal activity,\" May says. \"And while that may be true in a lot of places, in Atlanta black people have done a good job at making this a constructive movement as well.\" Rapper 21 Savage attends a screening of Noisey: Atlanta 2 at The Plaza Theatre in Atlanta in January.\n                \n                    \n                    Paras Griffin/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rapper 21 Savage attends a screening of Noisey: Atlanta 2 at The Plaza Theatre in Atlanta in January. To understand how broad trap's fascination has traveled one need only watch the 2015 web-series Noisey: Atlanta. The 10-part doc racked up tens of millions of views and boatloads of controversy for its safari-like expose of Traplanta. Even Waka Flocka Flame took to Twitter to voice criticism: \"Noisey I really feel like y'all exploitin the bad and the good in Atlanta #NotF******Kool #atall!!!!!!\" In the series, Noisey offered unprecedented access to the zones of the city that people all over the world celebrate without ever grappling with the reality. (That's true of many who call Atlanta home.) The episode featuring Migos turned the trappings of the group's success \u2014 semi-automatic weapons and Ziploc bags of weed in a suburban Stockbridge mini-mansion \u2014 into something resembling a theater of the absurd. It wound up having real-life consequences. Footage from the Migos episode was used to deny group member Offset's bond after the trio was arrested on gun and drug charges following a performance at Georgia Southern University. In a call-in interview from jail to a local radio show, he called Noisey \"the police\" while insinuating the creators of the documentary tricked them into playing themselves on camera. This January, the week after Atlanta lost Super Bowl LI, Noisey: Atlanta 2 premiered. The 44-minute episode was a follow-up to the original, and a chance to counterbalance the sensationalistic depiction. \"We really wanted to go back and make amends for how people took our documentary and used it against people,\" Andy Capper, who produced both series, says. \"We were mad about that [and] we got some criticism and flack, too.\" To return they sought the approval of Migos and the trio's managers Kevin \"Coach K\" Lee and Pierre \"Pee\" Thomas. The two men behind the indie label Quality Control, home to both Migos and Lil Yachty, are the main conduits between Atlanta trap and the bi-coastal music industry. Coach K's industry influence includes formerly managing both Jeezy and Gucci Mane at different times in their careers. \"The most significant permit we got from the city was the blessing of Coach K and Pee,\" Capper says. This time Noisey traded the shock-and-awe imagery of guns and drugs for sincere depictions of the violence and despair that undergirds the music. A kitchen scene in which 21 Savage pulls out a collection of funeral programs and begins counting off all the friends he's tragically lost feels more climactic than anything in the first series. But Noisey also understands why trap's subversive elements are so compelling to commercial audiences. \"The music sounds so dangerous and allows them to live vicariously through [acts like] the Migos,\" Capper says. \"The Rolling Stones and Robert Johnson would sing about the devil. It's in the tradition of all the best R&B, blues and rock and roll music. That's why it's so successful.\" Noisey: Atlanta 2 host Zach Goldbaum, who does a solid job addressing the roots of the subculture without shying away from all the vice, agrees. \"Since the early '90s people have been obsessed with street culture,\" he says. \"Trap music is a brand and [Atlanta's] able to own that so exquisitely. That's why we love Atlanta so much. That independent spirit of Atlanta is what we wanted to come through in the documentary. The level of influence is crazy .... The entire coast from Miami to New York sounds like Atlanta, so we wanted to make something that really celebrates the effect the city's had on the music industry and the sound of popular music.\" But you can't talk about the popularity of Traplanta without dredging up the socioeconomic mess that undergirds it. Not even Noisey's daring brand of cultural tourism delves deep enough to reckon with such systemic failures as an Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal that's left behind a whole generation of students; an income inequality gap ranked No. 1 in the nation by the Brookings Institute two years in a row (2014-2015); and an upward mobility deficit that determines metro Atlanta children have a smaller chance of moving out of poverty than those born on the bottom rungs of any other major urban region in the country, according to the Harvard University-backed Equality of Opportunity Project. \"Many of the young people who grow up in the margins of our society in a city like Atlanta are becoming extremely successful by creating something that the whole world is acclaiming,\" says Atlanta City Councilman Kwanza Hall, who is among the dozen-plus candidates in the city's upcoming mayoral election. \"It's a direct reflection of the inequality that we keep hearing everybody harp about in our city: the lack of equity, the lack of inclusion, the income differential that we see between those who have and those who have not.\" Raised on the black and bougie side of southwest Atlanta, the local politician's late father served as one of Martin Luther King's youngest staff members. Hall's three terms on city council, representing the same Old Fourth Ward neighborhood Dr. King grew up in, have been marked by attempts to reach across broad cultural lines. Though he isn't considered a forerunner at this early stage in the race, he probably bears more genuine ties to Atlanta's hip-hop community than any other candidate. He presented the most vocal opposition on city council to a controversial local ordinance proposed last December that would have severely tightened restrictions on music recording studios in a city whose cultural lifeblood flows from them. But Hall also acknowledges the concerns that inspired the ordinance due to the number of recording studios located in residential areas where they tend to blend in with the surrounding neighborhood. Last March, popular local rapper Bankroll Fresh died violently during a shootout outside of northwest Atlanta's Street Execs Studio \u2014 the same recording home of Billboard chart-topper 2 Chainz. The ordinance would have banned studios within 500 feet of residential areas. \"This is an environment that is constantly evolving,\" Hall says. \"It has an impact on the expectations of quality of life that new residents, and sometimes longtime residents, feel they deserve because they've invested as well.\" Hall believes the solution lies in fostering ties that reach beyond the typical distinctions of race and class. \"There's an opportunity for a cultural connection,\" he says, \"but right now we have some[thing] of a disconnect.\" Yet the Street Execs shooting also represents an outgrowth of the same failed socioeconomic policies that have turned trap into a more viable career path out of the hood. For those whose realities contradict Atlanta's black mecca mythology, rap is often seen as a way out of no way. It's no coincidence, then, that the most neglected and historically deprived parts of town have produced the city's most treasured assets. \"We're creating a culture that's going all around the world,\" Hall says. \"So consequently, we have influence. How we leverage that influence could mean economic opportunity or it could mean strife and civil war. It's that powerful.\" Lakeith Stanfield (left), Donald Glover (center) and Brian Tyree Henry in a still from Glover's series Atlanta, which depicts the life of a trap rapper and his cousin, an Ivy League dropout.\n                \n                    \n                    Guy D'Alema/FX\n                    \n                \nhide caption A quarter-century after Atlanta began its emergence as a music powerhouse, local and peach state politicians are finally arriving late to the party. After decades spent reaping the economic impact of Atlanta rap's local boosterism, there's a concerted push to invest in Georgia's music industry, which generates $3.7 billion annually \u2014 largely driven by Atlanta's hip-hop bona fides. New legislation introduced under the gold dome in Atlanta in January could offer a 20-25 percent tax credit to projects recorded or scored in-state that meet a $70,000 threshold. If passed, the Georgia Music Investment Act will put music production on par with the state tax credit offered for the last decade to film and TV productions like Donald Glover's Atlanta. When the plans for Glover's show initially began to circulate, the city responded with a collective side eye. Residents questioned whether he was authentic enough, black enough, Atlanta enough to do the city justice. By the time the premiere rolled around last September, it drew the largest 18-49 demo audience of a basic cable or primetime scripted comedy series in the last three years. The season would go on to disprove all the doubts surrounding its star and creator. By shaping the plot of Atlanta around an average trapper-turned-rapper and his exceptional Ivy League dropout cousin-turned-manager, Glover accomplished something equally profound by humanizing the trap. \"Donald Glover's doing a tremendous service by being honest about certain parts of Atlanta,\" Andrew Aydin, an Atlanta native and congressional staffer for Congressman John Lewis tells me. But Atlanta alone is not at fault for its failure to embrace its hip-hop identity. As a blue city surrounded by purple 'burbs in a blood red state, racial politics throughout the region have long kept the black mecca from attaining its vision. The decades-late push for a music tax credit is coming at the same time that MARTA, the city's rapid transit system, is on the cusp of a partial expansion denied it for more than 40 years. Atlanta's legacy of racialized transportation policies is symptomatic of a larger disease. \"How many statewide politicians have won elections by running against Atlanta?\" Aydin asks. \"And yet, those same campaigns are financed by some of the same corporations that exist in Atlanta.\" The music tax credit will require statewide politicians to buy into a predominantly black music industry, just as MARTA's economic stability and growth has always been dependent on white suburbanites and state regulators opposed to supporting mass transit purportedly used for Moving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta. Even the bigoted old nickname coined for MARTA still speaks volumes. \"When your state government is telling the rest of the state that Atlanta is the problem not the answer, it breeds that strife. It breeds that conflict,\" Aydin continues. \"And eventually I think everybody, the state and city folks, are going to have to realize you have to embrace Atlanta \u2014 you have to embrace the weird; you have to embrace the different \u2014 because that's our best product. That's our best potential for future growth.\" Nayvadius Wilburn is the present embodiment of that future. Quite literally. The rapper Future got his stage name from his older cousin Rico Wade, co-founder of the legendary Dungeon Family and Organized Noize. As the story goes, Wade would tell his younger cousin, then an aspiring emcee known as Meathead, that he was indeed the future, the one to carry on the Dungeon Family legacy and, in turn, Atlanta hip-hop. The same year Future launched the first in a trio of career-defining mixtapes (Monster, Beast Mode, 56 Nights) that set him up for his first No. 1 album, DS2, Phil W. Hudson began covering music, sports and finance at the Atlanta Business Chronicle. Hudson quickly recognized the huge chasm that existed between the city's hip-hop culture and its business community. While hanging out with one of his finance sources, who worked for a multinational accounting firm that was soliciting a new pro athlete as a client, Hudson asked him, \"'Do you guys have any rappers on your roster?'\" The answer surprised him. \"I asked why the hell not,\" Hudson says. \"And he said, 'We just never really thought about that.' I said, 'Well that's ridiculous because I'm sure Jermaine Dupri, at the height of his career, was worth more money than some of these major executives in town.'\" The more Hudson interviewed Atlanta-based hip-hop talent and executives, the clearer the issue became: Black music's worldwide marketing power was being slept on by some of Atlanta's biggest global brands. \"One of the best points that was ever made about the disconnect in Atlanta came from Jermaine Dupri,\" Hudson says. \"He told me he was really shocked that Usher was signed with Pepsi. He was like, 'How can Coca-Cola, the world's biggest behemoth in the soft drink industry, let their fierce rival come into their own backyard and take what is potentially one of our biggest music brands in Usher?\" The missed opportunity is even clearer in rap, where artists derive their clout from bragging about lifestyle and luxury brands in songs and videos that often double as major commercial endorsements. It's a simple equation, according to Hudson: \"Rappers make things cool. What's cool becomes pop culture. What becomes pop culture sells.\" Of course, there are exceptions to this alienation. Lil Yachty may not have gotten any stage time at the Grammys this year, despite his first-time nomination, but he still managed to bumrush the show. The Atlanta bubblegum trap act starred alongside pop star Carly Rae Jepsen in an epic Target commercial, the longest of the night at three minutes. Atlanta superproducer Mike Will Made-It was also featured. With his red-beaded braids and a drug-free persona as playful as his music, Yachty's become a brand unto himself. His endorsements include Nautica, the apparel brand he's reviving as its newly-named creative designer, and hometown beverage Sprite. Coke's cooler decaffeinated cousin has actually enjoyed a long relationship with hip-hop. It dates as far back as 1986, when Kurtis Blow appeared in an early commercial rapping the tagline \"Now More Than Ever It's Sprite.\" Along with a host of East Coast legends, other Sprite endorsers over the years have included such foundational Atlanta acts as Kris Kross and Goodie Mob. But most of Atlanta's genre-defining artists over the past couple of decades have remained noticeably absent from the soft drink's hip-hop-themed campaigns. Trap rap, in particular, has its own cross to bear. When Future released DS2, the name was abbreviated from Dirty Sprite 2 for obvious legal reasons. There's no way Coca-Cola would've given Epic Records permission to associate its brand with the promethazine-syrup laced \"Dirty Sprite\" that Future references in his signature codeine flows. Sex, drugs and rock and roll may be as American as cherry pie, but hip-hop has always faced greater persecution over its illicit content than whiter music genres. \"It's definitely a complex scenario,\" Hudson says. \"There's racial elements, there's business elements, there's marketing elements.\" But there's also \"a lot of missed opportunity,\" he acknowledges, recalling the widespread response he got while traveling abroad to China. \"When I'd say I'm from Atlanta, it wasn't Coca-Cola that the Chinese knew us by. It was the Olympics and OutKast. We have this incredible brand, so how can we capitalize on this? That's partly the job of Christopher Hicks, a former music industry exec who wants to help connect the dots as the new director of the Mayor's Office of Film and Entertainment. \"We have a plethora of large brands here [that] exist in the city and have not necessarily leveraged the musical stakeholders in the city, so I want to create relationships there,\" he told Billboard last March. But Hicks' position in an office originally created to exploit opportunities within the nascent film industry speaks directly to the disconnect. \"The music industry was really put off at how hard the state worked to recruit film, an industry from out of state that really doesn't have any loyalty to Georgia other than our tax incentive,\" Hudson says. \"So why do we have this homegrown industry that we're not helping? L.A. Reid doesn't live in Atlanta anymore. He should. And if we catered to our music industry better and incentivized it more we might be able to get more record labels to come here and stay here and leave their offices here. It creates jobs and brings revenue to the state. It's the whole economic impact. I feel like we're missing out on a lot by not embracing it.\" The onus is on the city of Atlanta to figure out how to harness hip-hop's hustle. Because the culture doesn't need Atlanta to succeed; Atlanta needs the culture. The question is whether an independent ecosystem that has turned Atlanta's underserved music community into a global beacon would be helped or hampered by the city's interference? Kwanza Hall wants to find ways to create infrastructure around what has essentially been a cottage industry. \"I want to industrialize it and formalize it,\" says Hall, who considers the city's wealth of home recording studios greater innovation zones than Georgia Tech, the only university to make Fast Company's recent list of the World's Most Innovative Companies. \"People are working with far less and making a whole lot more out of nothing. They're taking thin air and turning it into something that is of value in this society,\" Hall says. But true investment in the culture has to dive much deeper than industry infrastructure, according to one of the most devout advocates of Atlanta's creative economy, Bem Joiner. \"The lack of affordable housing, gentrification, piss-poor public schools, those are key cogs in the wheel,\" he says. \"That's like the secret sauce to how the culture is made.\" Secret sauce, indeed. Meanwhile, Atlanta's next ingenious reincarnation could ironically mimic the birthplace of hip-hop. A new proposal to loosen downtown signage restrictions could result in a district full of bright, oversized LED-display ads \u2014 just like Times Square. Hudson, for one, thinks ATL should seek inspiration a tad closer to home. \"Nashville did such a good job embracing country music that it turned Nashville into Music City,\" he says. \"Well, Nashville didn't really invent country music, it came there. We didn't really invent hip-hop, it kinda came here. They created this culture around country and it's put the city on the international music map. Atlanta needs to do that with hip-hop.\" Sounds like a bright idea. But what would it look like if Atlanta and the state of Georgia were to truly leverage its biggest cultural export and invest in its success? Might we see an Atlanta Hip-Hop Hall of Fame located on Peachtree Street? Or maybe a Music Row district could set up shop in south Downtown for hundreds of hip-hop related businesses \u2014 major and independent labels, recording studios and publishing houses, consumer tech startups and media outlets \u2014 to flourish within an economic incubator driven by the culture? Perhaps a Grand Ole Opry-style performance hall for rap would serve as a major tourist attraction and cultural nexus for the economically-deprived creatives and the city's wealthy elite to meet? Not even in the last black mecca is that a likely scenario. Outsiders may have zero qualms with embracing the culture. But closer to home, Traplanta is saddled with too much of the same racial baggage and class exclusion that criminalizes the music in the eyes and ears of many in power. The same pols who disgrace their districts by failing to advocate for economic equity find themselves more offended by crass lyrical content than the crass conditions that inspire it. Meanwhile, systemic ills continue to fester at will. It's enough to make you wonder who the real trappers are in this town.",

Maine is one of 19 states that rejected Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act. But on Tuesday, it could be the first to approve it at the ballot box. Question 2 asks Maine voters if they want to provide roughly 70,000 Mainers with health care coverage by expanding eligibility of Medicaid, known as MaineCare. It provides health coverage for people living at or near the poverty line. The national battle over Medicaid expansion began with a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision that conservatives originally hoped would hobble the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature legislative achievement. But instead of repealing the law's individual mandate requiring that most Americans obtain health insurance, the court upheld it. The court then struck down a provision requiring all states to expand eligibility of Medicaid. That surprise 2012 court ruling shifted the political battle. While the GOP-led House of Representatives would go on to take over 50 symbolic ACA repeal votes, progressive and conservative activists descended on state legislatures to fight over Medicaid expansion. The intensity of those battles illustrated the importance of Medicaid expansion as a component of the ACA. The program not only lowered the number of people without health insurance, it also has arguably made repealing the health care law harder. Medicaid funding cuts included in Senate bills to repeal ACA were the primary reason that Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, broke ranks with most of the GOP to oppose the bills. \"First, both proposals make sweeping changes and cuts in the Medicaid program. Expert projections show that more than $1 trillion would be taken out of the Medicaid program between the years 2020 and 2036,\" she said in September. \"This would have a devastating impact to a program that has been on the books for 50 years and provides health care to our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled children and low-income seniors.\" Collins has also cited the impact on Maine's rural hospitals, which are heavily dependent on Medicaid reimbursement payments. Effects On The Uninsured Architects of the federal health care law sought to lower the number of people without health insurance by requiring most Americans to have coverage. The law also lets states expand access to Medicaid, a federal program run by the states and funded with a mix of state and federal money. In 2013, Maine's legislature voted to expand the state's program, and Republican Gov. Paul LePage vetoed the bill. It was the first of a half dozen vetoes. About 9 percent of Maine residents lacked insurance in 2016, comparable to 8.6 percent in the 31 states and the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid. That could be because the state had expanded its program in 2002 and 2003. The number of people enrolled in Medicaid has been dropping, as the LePage administration moved aggressively to restrict eligibility In 2012, there were 345,000 Mainers receiving Medicaid. There were 268,000 through June of this year, according the Department of Health and Human Services. The state spends $2.6 billion on the program, with two-thirds of that coming from the feds. Meanwhile, roughly 70,000 Mainers have fallen into what's known as the ACA coverage gap. The gap occurs in the 19 states that did not expand Medicaid. The ACA originally conceived Medicaid expansion as a bridge between low-income adults already eligible for Medicaid coverage and those who could qualify for subsidies to purchase their own individual plans. But without expansion, thousands of Mainers neither qualify for subsidies nor Medicaid. Most of the 70,000 people who would gain coverage if Question 2 passes earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $16,000 a year for an individual and $34,000 for a family of four. For And Against Conservative and progressive activists have engaged in a long, pitched fight over Medicaid expansion. The arguments for and against expansion haven't changed much, and neither have the methods of persuasion. Conservatives repeatedly note that Maine was an early expander of Medicaid in 2002-2003. They claim that the state's uninsured rate was unaffected by increasing eligibility and that the program became a budget buster, creating deficits when state revenues declined during the economic downturn. Progressives counter that early expansion helped keep Maine's uninsured rate steady while other states saw a surge. Additionally, they argue that the higher federal reimbursement rate offered through the ACA protects the state. If expansion passes, the federal government will initially cover 94 percent of the cost. That ratchets down to 90 percent by 2020 and stays at that level, as long as Congress doesn't cut reimbursements. But Brent Littlefield with the anti-expansion Welfare to Work PAC says there's still a cost to Maine taxpayers. \"The current plan would have state taxpayers paying between $50 million to $100 million per year,\" he says. The expansion debate has been marked by its heated rhetoric. Opponents have repeatedly called would-be recipients \"able bodied,\" while calling the proposal \"welfare expansion\" \u2014 descriptions designed to tap sharply divided public perceptions of people receiving public assistance. Proponents, meanwhile, have been stressing the human impact, focusing on personal stories of those who would benefit from the program. High Stakes Question 2 has been billed by some as a final resolution, but it could also be a litmus test for public sentiment about the Affordable Care Act. GOP repeal efforts have not polled well. While the ACA has not been a centerpiece of the proponents' arguments for expansion, an affirmative expansion vote on Nov. 7 could be spun as a tacit public endorsement for the health care law, because Medicaid is such a key component. Locally, the political stakes are high. LePage has been a leading critic of expansion, and he's taking an active role in opposing Question 2. Defeating Question 2 could validate the governor's stance. Conversely, an affirmative vote could deal a blow to the governor's full-court press against the law. But a victory for supporters of Question 2 could be fleeting. The state legislature changed, delayed or attempted to repeal all four of the ballot initiatives that voters approved last year.

About 20 minutes into the beautiful documentary Quest, a stray bullet strikes a 13-year-old African-American girl in a neighborhood in North Philadelphia, robbing her of sight in her left eye. What's remarkable about the incident is that the documentary would have existed without it: Director Jonathan Olshefski had already committed to making a film about the girl's family, the Raineys, and the errant gunfire just happened to occur within the flow of the day. The possibility of violence was always going to be a part of the film, which covers four years in the lives of a working-class family, but the reality of it is bracing on another level. The girl's heartbreaking first instinct is to apologize to her father for getting shot; she should have known better somehow. The Raineys are ordinary and extraordinary, held up as both a typical example of a North Philly family with strong roots in the neighborhood and a specific collection of big-hearted, creative, and resilient people who have to paddle hard to keep their heads above the poverty line. The closest thing Quest has to a hook is the basement music studio where the patriarch, Christopher Rainey, produces recordings by local hip-hop talent, including his weekly \"Freestyle Fridays.\" Beyond that, the film doesn't fit easily into a logline and its observational style, free of voiceover or titles or any other connective tissue, allows for some gaps and rough edges in the storytelling. Out of 300 hours of footage, Olshefski simply culls the truest impression of the Raineys he can muster. Quest is bookended by Obama's reelection in 2012 and Trump's ascendence in 2016, which set a fascinating context for the Raineys' lives. On the one hand, Christopher and his wife Christine'a, who works at a women's shelter, are shown lobbying hard for Obama, encouraging friends and radio listeners to help get out the vote in a crucial swing state. They're also shown recoiling at Trump's infamous \"What have you got to lose?\" pitch to the black community, particularly his description of inner-city neighborhoods like theirs as \"war zones.\" Yet there's also an acute sense that they're on their own, regardless of who's in charge of the country, and that the politicians stumping for their vote before Election Day are not going to solve their problems once in office. For the Raineys, those problems are significant from the start. Christopher and Christine'a both had now-grown children from a previous marriage and Christine's son is battling a brain tumor while caring for his own newborn boy. Though his studio offers a refuge from daily hardships, Christopher's most talented rapper is suffering from alcohol addiction and asking for chance after chance after chance. Then there's the common grind of eking out enough money to stay in their single-family home and provide for their daughter P.J., who's a wonderful kid, but heading into the moodiness of adolescence. When P.J. gets shot, the film snaps suddenly into focus, but it never loses track of the basic stresses imposed on the Raineys and the close partnership needed to survive them. Titled after Christopher's hip-hop nickname, as well as the aspirational qualities of the Rainey family, Quest could be received as a low-key answer to projects like PBS' An American Family and Richard Linklater's Boyhood, with the Raineys cast as an avatar of black working-class life. But save for the political echoes that frame it, the film resists the urge the generalize their struggles, for fear of losing the particular intimacies that make the Raineys unique. Olshefski allows full years to pass without much incident, but his camera captures touching bits of sketchwork, like P.J. banking in basketball shots in the driveway shortly after her release from the hospital or Christine'a telling the girl why her school-year wardrobe will fall short of expectations. Quest is the type of independent film about American life that should be common but is rare in actuality, because there's nothing commercial or grabby about capturing a family's domestic routines so directly. That Olshefski could never have imagined a stray bullet transforming his documentary is part of its fundamental integrity, because he clearly felt a less dramatic portrait of the Raineys would have been compelling enough on its own. He's right. Christopher, Christine'a, and P.J. are beautiful to watch together, and there's hope in witnessing them persevere \u2014 in an underserved neighborhood, against shifting political tides, beset by the random cruelties of fate. They're a model family, even without the film needing to exalt them as such.",

Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters march in New York's Times Square on February 19, 2017, in solidarity with American Muslims and against the travel ban ordered by President Donald Trump. The day Donald Trump took office, six members of the presidential advisory commission for Asian American Pacific Islanders stepped down. Last week, another 10 resigned. They wrote in a scathing letter that Trump's immigration executive orders, slash of federal funds to sanctuary cities, bans on refugees and opposition to the Affordable Care Act, had \"deleterious consequences\" for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. \"We object to your portrayal of immigrants, refugees, people of color and people of various faiths as untrustworthy, threatening and a drain on our nation,\" the letter stated. Only four commissioners remain on the panel. While political resignations are common at the start of presidential transitions, this was a remarkably public, mass exodus from an advisory group created by President Bill Clinton in 1999 and renewed by each president through an executive order ever since. These resignations are a reminder that appointees to race-specific commissions are inevitably racial representatives, whose work is seen as both powerful symbol and political shield. And for Asian-Americans, the fastest-growing racial group in the United States that saw a 46 percent population jump between 2000 and 2010, this reflects the end of what Pei-te Lien, a University of California, Santa Barbara political science professor, called the community's \"cozy\" relationship with the White House. About 60 percent of AAPIs were born outside the U.S., and from 2001 and 2010, Asians made up 26 percent of refugee arrivals. Surveys show that AAPIs as a whole are drifting from the Republican Party, and a majority voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. And in each presidential election cycle, according to a report from the National Asian American Survey, there's an average increase of 600,000 registered AAPI voters. The point of such a commission, and in this case, a presidential one for AAPIs, is pretty straightforward: to create a two-way flow of information between the highest levels of government and the broader AAPI community, said Linda X. Phan, executive director of Asian Family Support Services in Austin, Texas, who resigned from the commission last week. \"Our charge was to make sure the policies put in place were to help out the AAPI community, and to make the federal government much more accessible to everyone,\" Phan said. At least, that's how it's worked before. On Inauguration Day, the AAPI commission's signature project on disaggregating data about Asian-Americans was deleted from Whitehouse.gov, along with a LGBT rights page. According to multiple commissioners who stepped down, their messages to the White House calling for meetings and expressing their concerns were met with silence. The White House did not immediately respond to NPR's request for an on-the-record comment. \"Under Trump, we tried to hold on and wait as long as possible,\" Daphne Kwok, who served as chair of President Obama's AAPI committee for four years and also runs the AARP's multicultural markets for Asian-Americans, said. The task force members would have held their seats until September 30, 2017, at which point, as past transitions showed, the president could reauthorize the commission and appoint new members. Kwok said she'd plan to serve out her term, but with the executive orders, no longer felt that the commission was the best way for her to advocate on behalf of AAPIs. In the past, the commission was able to push the federal government to provide more language resources and translation services, and to disaggregate data about the various AAPI subgroups. This data disaggregation project, which started under President Obama's tenure and was a joint venture with the Department of Education's White House AAPI initiative, helped chip away at the \"model minority\" myth by showing how specific AAPI ethnic groups fared when it came to areas including education, health, employment and immigration. (While this data project no longer appears on WhiteHouse.gov, part of it is still accessible on the Department of Education's site.) This data was intended to help policymakers decide where to spend federal money. For example, according to the DoE's website, disaggregated education data helped show which colleges had large numbers of low-income AAPI students and students living below the poverty line, indicating which schools might need more funding. But with a dwindling board, a non-communicative White House and a president trying to implement policies that they said went against their values, both Kwok and Phan said they felt their role on the advisory commission was pointless. When Phan was invited to join President Obama's commission in 2014, she was wary of joining a panel that might not have legitimate power. \"There are commissions, especially with federal commissions, they can be staffed by big donors or folks who aren't willing to roll up their sleeves but enjoy the title.\" \"You can join a task force or a commission and just have your name on something, and not do real work,\" Phan said. Her concern foreshadowed what was to come as the commission sat through the White House transition, watching Trump's immigration policies and refugee bans unfurl. That ability to do \"real work\" depends largely on how a commission is designed, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor and associate dean of public policy at the University of California, Riverside. Well-staffed commissions, with appointees with differing backgrounds in the corporate, nonprofit and academic worlds have \"the potential to reflect the community's issues that no other can do,\" Ramakrishnan said, and hosting public hearings to hear from actual people in the community is also crucial. For example, Ramakrishnan serves on the California Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander American Affairs and has worked with the White House Initiative for AAPIs. He says that when California implemented a program that would issue special driver's licenses regardless of a person's immigration status, the state commission heard from residents that AAPI folks were struggling to produce the necessary documents. The commission reached out to the DMV and governor's office, and discovered that certain program documents were only in Spanish and English, not in any Asian language. The commission recommended these documents be translated, and now there are instructions in Chinese, Farsi, Hindi, Korean, Punjabi, Tagalog and Vietnamese. But Ramakrishnan also cautioned that it's easy for politicians to use racial commissions \"as a way to deflect criticism that may be lodged against them.\" In other words: the political version of \"I have Asian friends and ...\" \"This is always the dilemma for minorities,\" said Pei-te Lien, a University of California, Santa Barbara political science professor. Recognition as a community \u2014 especially for a relatively small one \u2014 is crucial, but not at the cost of co-signing detrimental policies, she said. \"It's about the politics here. As a minority, we would like to be able to be included, but we definitely also know there's a risk of being marginalized, just like symbols.\" Still, Lien wrote in an email, it's important not to inadvertently devalue \"the politics of symbolism, which can be highly valuable to a small, extremely diverse, and majority-immigrant community such as the AAPI.\" President Trump has the option to issue an executive order to reauthorize the AAPI initiative later this year and appoint new members. There are no other equivalent race-based presidential advisory commissions, though there are White House Initiatives run by the U.S. Department of Education that include a program on Historically Black Colleges and Universities and on the \"educational excellence\" for Hispanics. In Congress, there are the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which play important advisory roles for the legislative and executive branches of government. \"I think these commissioners, by taking collective action, made a powerful statement,\" Ramakrishnan said. AAPI voices haven't been able to get much political or media attention, he said, so this mass resignation gives an alternative face to the AAPI pushback of Trump's policies. Ramakrishnan points to what he calls the prevailing mainstream image of the AAPI resistance against Trump: An unidentified Asian-American woman at an inauguration march. She's raising her two middle fingers. The exit of three-fourths of the AAPI presidential commissioners is its own form of protest, Ramakrishnan said. \"We haven't seen that many powerful AAPI voices band together and get noticed.\"",

            "article_content": "Officials in Lawrence and Chelsea have filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order cracking down on sanctuary cities. The measure threatens to pull federal funding from those cities.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Next we travel to a city of immigrants, Chelsea, Mass. Its factories attracted Europeans in the 19th century. It's now mostly Hispanic, and close to a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. Now this small city is suing the federal government because of a move by the Trump administration. Shannon Dooling reports from our member station WBUR. SHANNON DOOLING, BYLINE: Beyond its lean budget and blue collar history, Chelsea is also a so-called sanctuary city. That unofficial designation is what ultimately prompted the lawsuit. The suit challenges the constitutionality of President Trump's executive order threatening to pull federal funding from sanctuary cities, places where local law enforcement don't ask about an individual's immigration status and may not fully comply with federal immigration agents. In Chelsea, the act of suing the federal government is just as much about protecting residents as it is about protecting federal dollars. At Amazonia Jeans on Broadway, Chelsea shop owner Fatima Ortiz talks to a few customers. Business has been slow ever since the election. Ortiz says 90 percent of her clientele are Hispanic, and right now many of them aren't leaving their homes. They're afraid of being swept up in deportation raids. FATIMA ORTIZ: The only place that's busy right now is the post office. Everybody is getting the passport for the kids. They are ready to leave in the moment that they have to leave. DOOLING: Broadway is lined with stores like Sabor Latino, Campeon Soccer and Mi Salvador Mexicano, all reflections of a diverse community. But Ortiz says that sense of community may be at risk. ORTIZ: It's impossible to feel normal, like, because there's no people around. Like, everybody's scared to go out. And it's very, very difficult. IVAN ESPINOZA-MADRIGAL: These cities and the people living in these communities have rights. DOOLING: Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal is executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, the group representing Chelsea and nearby Lawrence in the lawsuit. He says these cash-strapped cities can't afford to lose federal money. ESPINOZA-MADRIGAL: It would mean the closure of schools. It would mean firing city workers. It would mean destabilizing entire communities and disrupting families. DOOLING: No city has actually lost any funding yet. Federal officials wouldn't comment for this piece, but U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said Department of Justice dollars may be especially vulnerable in sanctuary cities. He called on local leaders to fully cooperate with the federal government in the interest of public safety. Larger metros like San Francisco and Seattle also filed lawsuits. All of the briefs make the same basic arguments, calling the stripping of funding an unconstitutional breach of state's rights. Chelsea City Manager Thomas Ambrosino says financial resources are not the only thing at stake. THOMAS AMBROSINO: Our residents are fearful. And we felt it was important to send a message that the city of Chelsea was in the business of trying to protect the people who live here regardless of your immigration or documentation status. DOOLING: The federal government claims the city has acted prematurely and that they can't prove they've been harmed by the mere existence of the executive order.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama signs the Affordable Care Act on March 23, 2010. Congress is back in session on Tuesday, and leaders of both houses say their first order of business will be to repeal Obamacare. If they do that, it will be a slap in the face to President Obama just three weeks before he leaves the White House. The Affordable Care is the outgoing president's signature achievement, marked by an elaborate signing ceremony in March 2010 at the White House, with lofty speeches from the vice president and Obama himself. \"Today, after almost a century of trying, today after over a year of debate, today, after all the votes have been tallied, health insurance reform becomes law in the United States of America,\" Obama said that day, to long applause from the assembled crowd. And Joe Biden famously leaned over to remind the president that it was \"a big f****** deal.\" But Republicans have been vowing to repeal the law since the day it passed, and they'll soon have a sympathetic president in the White House to sign whatever bill they send him. \"We will repeal the disaster known as Obamacare and create new health care, all sorts of reforms that work for you and your family,\" President-elect Donald Trump vowed last month in Orlando. That new health care plan hasn't been fleshed out yet by Trump or his allies in Congress. So they say they'll vote to get rid of Obamacare, but delay its demise until they come up with a replacement that will cover the millions of people who have insurance thanks to the law. Insurance companies and health care analysts are worried. \"I don't see how you talk to any [insurance] carrier and give them any desire to hang around to see what they replace it with,\" says Dr. Kavita Patel, an internist at Johns Hopkins University Hospital and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"Why would you stick around for that?\" Patel worked in the White House and helped create the Affordable Care Act. But she's not alone in her concern. Last month the health insurance trade group America's Health Insurance Plans sent a letter to lawmakers asking them to keep in place many of the financial incentives that are central to the law \u2014 including subsidies for patients to help them buy insurance and cover copayments, and a provision that eliminates some taxes on insurers. The American Academy of Actuaries also warned in its own letter that a repeal of the ACA without replacing it would be dangerous to the long-term health of the insurance market. Still, Republicans appear determined to move ahead with the vote as soon as this week. Some history: Democrats rammed the Affordable Care Act through Congress in 2010 with no Republican support. It was a huge, complicated law and, like most legislation, it was flawed. Over the subsequent six years, Republicans, who were angry at the way the Affordable Care Act was passed, refused to cooperate in any actions that would be seen as helping it succeed. Instead, they promised in speeches and television interviews to repeal it entirely. In fact, the House has voted more than 60 times over the years to do just that. Then-Speaker of the House John Boehner stands next to a printed version of the Affordable Care Act during a Capitol Hill news conference on May 16, 2013.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-Speaker of the House John Boehner stands next to a printed version of the Affordable Care Act during a Capitol Hill news conference on May 16, 2013. \"There's no getting around the fact that lots of Republicans campaigned hard against the ACA and a lot of them won, including the person at the top of the ticket,\" says James Capretta, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But even with control of both chambers of Congress and with Trump in the White House, Republicans can't simply repeal Obamacare. They would need the help of at least a handful of Democrats to overcome a filibuster. Democrats can't, however, filibuster budget bills. So Republican leaders have decided to defund Obamacare, eliminating the tax penalties for those who don't buy insurance and the subsidies to help people pay their premiums. Essentially, that guts the law's main elements. The problem for Republicans is that today, an estimated 20 million people get their insurance through Obamacare. About 10 million buy policies through the exchanges set up by state and federal governments, and most of those patients get subsidies to help pay the premiums. And millions more are covered because the law allows states to expand the number of people who are eligible for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. So people who had pre-existing conditions that shut them out of the insurance market before the ACA passed, or people who had reached insurer-imposed lifetime benefit limits, generally like the law. But, then there are people like Will Denecke, who is mad because his insurance costs have gone up since Obamacare passed. Before the law was enacted, he spent about $340 a month on health insurance. \"Incredibly, we got a notice from my health care company, Moda, which has been having financial problems, that my premium was going up to $930,\" he said last October. He's a self-employed urban planning consultant in Portland, Ore., and, unlike most people in Obamacare, he makes too much money to qualify for government subsidies. \"I've had health insurance my whole life, but it's just offensive in principle to think of spending $1,000 a month on health care insurance when there is a good chance I won't need it,\" he said. He was considering just letting his coverage lapse. And, on the other side, you've got people like Leigh Kvetko of Dallas. She takes 10 medications every day because she's had two organ transplant procedures, and the drugs are part of her daily regimen to survive. After Obamacare passed, she was able quit her job at a big company and start a business with her husband, because she could finally get individual insurance. \"This particular plan, the fact that they cannot discriminate against me because of how I was born, was a lifesaver, literally,\" she says. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told the Washington Times last month that consumers needn't worry. \"We can assure the American public that the plan they're in right now, the Obamacare plans, will not end on Jan. 20, that we're going to be prepared and ready with new options tailored for them,\" he said.",

Despite some last-minute challenges, Republicans appear to have the votes to give President Trump his first legislative victory. Final passage of the bill that will reshape the tax system and touch nearly every American is expected early this week, possibly Tuesday or Wednesday. It will be Trump's first significant legislative accomplishment, not a bad Christmas gift for a president, who often boasts of lesser successes. Poll after poll after poll after poll have found the tax bill unpopular with most Americans. So what wound up in the bill \u2014 and what didn't? Here are some of the highlights: Other controversial issues, like 401(k)s caps and graduate-student tax credits, in the end, were not affected. The bill has to pass exactly as is \u2014 they can't move a semicolon \u2014 in both chambers or they have to go back to the negotiating table. Support late last week from Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Bob Corker, R-Tenn., made Republicans pretty sure it's going to pass easily. For more on how this bill affects you, NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has you covered. House Speaker Paul Ryan speaks about the Republican tax legislation last week.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker Paul Ryan speaks about the Republican tax legislation last week. The big issue on the horizon is how much the tax bill adds to the deficit. It will add nearly $1.5 trillion to the deficit, and eventually, the money will have to come from somewhere. Democrats are gearing up for a fight in the New Year with Republicans, who they believe will make a real effort to cut entitlements. That might not be the best strategy for the GOP in an election year, but Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan signaled his intention to do just that last week. \"We're going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit,\" Ryan said on a conservative radio show, as the Washington Post highlighted. Ryan added, \"Frankly, it's the health care entitlements that are the big drivers of our debt, so we spend more time on the health care entitlements \u2014 because that's really where the problem lies, fiscally speaking.\" Of course, there are also rumors that Ryan will retire early next year once the tax bill is passed. Remember, Ryan never wanted this job. After John Boehner was forced out as speaker, and Ryan was the only one seen as having enough votes to succeed him, like the reluctant son coming home to run the family business. He has always wanted to implement a big tax overhaul bill \u2013 and if that's done, it might make some sense that he'd move on to something else. He's only 47, and a retirement would take him out of the firing line and allow him to lie in wait for a potential gubernatorial or even presidential run, whenever that might be. All that said, his office calls this talk \"pure speculation,\" and he laid out an ambitious 2018 agenda last week. \"Next year is going to be the year that we work on people,\" Ryan said. \"Next year is the year we work on getting people where they need to get in life, better jobs, actual career, closing the skills gap.\" He indicated welfare reform would be part of that, calling government assistance for low-income people a \"poverty trap.\" That's an ideological phrase he has repeated over and over again during the course of his career. Looking to the new year, Democrats are feeling emboldened on the heels of Democrat Doug Jones' win in Alabama this week. Republicans' already-narrow majority in the Senate has further narrowed \u2014 and virtually everything Republicans are going to want to do in the New Year is going to need 60 votes. That means Republicans will need Democratic votes, but there isn't a whole lot of common ground to find on the big issues of the day. Health care The GOP has tried and failed repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017 even using reconciliation, though, through the tax bill, Republicans do look like they will get through a repeal of the Obamacare mandate, which penalizes people for not buying insurance. The Trump administration instead is attempting to strangle the ACA's implementation, shortening sign-up days, refusing to extend them despite a last-minute surge, and cutting off cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which help keep people's premiums down. That comes down to the fundamental question that seems to divide Americans \u2013 how much should government do? When Gallup looked at Americans' views of health care after the 2016 election, it found a narrow majority believe it is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that all Americans have health care coverage. But when you dig inside the numbers \u2014 70 percent of Democrats and 51 percent of independents believe this, but 76 percent of Republicans say it's not the government's responsibility to ensure health care for all Americans. So the posture seen from Republicans in Congress and President Trump is not surprising. It's a similar story on immigration and likely infrastructure, too. Immigration People who call themselves DREAMers, protest in front of the U.S. Capitol to urge Congress to pass a DREAM Act earlier this month.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption People who call themselves DREAMers, protest in front of the U.S. Capitol to urge Congress to pass a DREAM Act earlier this month. Republicans have put forward measures related to the DREAM Act what have conditions Democrats see as unworkable or they find odious. (A DREAM Act would allow immigrants brought to the United States as children illegally a path to citizenship.) Following on Jones' win, Democrats probably have every incentive to keep the issue of immigration alive well into 2018 \u2014 and see no reason to relent on a conditions-free DREAM Act at this point. Trump, of course, is still (publicly anyway) hoping for a border wall. But that's something of a near impossibility, as Republicans will need Democratic votes in the Senate \u2014 and that number just went from eight to nine. Infrastructure When it comes to infrastructure, Republicans are prepping a bill. \"We're just now starting to work with the White House,\" Sam Graves of Missouri, chairman of a transportation and infrastructure subcommittee, told The Hill. \"They're giving us their feedback, so we're starting to see some feedback, ideas, things like that.\" But with Democrats' seeing a possible window opening to taking back control of the Senate, inroads made in the suburbs and Trump's approval ratings as low as they are, don't expect them to relent and look to give Trump any victories. They're certainly not going to do so without major concessions in return ahead of November 2018. Special counsel Robert Mueller arrives at the U.S. Capitol for closed meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in June.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Special counsel Robert Mueller arrives at the U.S. Capitol for closed meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in June. Trump said Sunday, \"No, I'm not\" going to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. He was asked if he intends to do so, as chatter has grown that he might. His lawyers took aim at the investigators in the Russia probe over the weekend because of transition emails Mueller's team obtained. Mueller's team says they obtained them legally \u2014 despite Trump's lawyer's protestations. So don't expect that in the week ahead. ... Shalom: Vice President Mike Pence delayed his scheduled trip to Israel this week. Palestinians refused to meet with him after Trump's decision to declare Jerusalem Israel's capital. Palestinian protesters set fire to pictures of Pence Sunday. But Pence might have had a more political reason for canceling the trip \u2013 the potential need for him to cast a tie-breaking vote on the tax bill this week, given Republican holdouts (who now appear on board) and senators suffering from illness who have missed votes. John McCain of Arizona, for example, who is suffering from side effects of brain cancer headed back to Arizona Sunday to be with family and is expected to miss the tax-bill vote. ... Kick the can: A spending bill needs to pass by the end of the week to keep the lights on in the government. Congress is expected to pass yet another temporary measure, pushing off spending negotiations another month. ... 2020 watch: New York Mayor Bill De Blasio speaks in Iowa Tuesday. ... Moore problems: Looking back on the Alabama Senate race, there were a host of reasons why Democrat Doug Jones won \u2014 high turnout among black voters, a 60-point swing among independents from 2012, a doubling of white support from Obama. But take a look at this chart below \u2014 while overall turnout was down a third (34 percent) from Roy Moore's 2012 chief justice win statewide, Moore's vote totals in highest vote-getting counties outpaced that. Translation: there were a whole heck of a lot of people who voted for Moore in 2012, who didn't do so in 2017. Looking back on the week, another reason @GDouglasJones won is because a whole lot of people who voted for Moore in 2012 for chief justice didn't in 2017. pic.twitter.com/sXOePlwYju",

            "article_content": "Iranians are voting Friday on whether to re-elect the country's president, Hassan Rouhani, who has promised greater freedom for a country dominated by conservative Muslim clerics.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Iranians are voting on the future of their country today. The Iranian people are not permitted to choose the ayatollah, who's their supreme leader, but they can choose a president. And the president who made a historic nuclear deal with the West is now seeking re-election. Our co-host Steve Inskeep has been reporting from Iran all this week. He joins us now on the line. Hey, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Hey there, Rachel. MARTIN: What have you learned this week? INSKEEP: Well, I've - we've gotten a few clues and a few data points about where this election is heading. President Hasan Rouhani faces a more conservative challenger. So on this election day, which is a holiday here in Iran, I went to a conservative part of the capital city, Tehran, a very old part of this mostly new city of many, many millions of people - it goes up and down the side of a mountain range. In this old section, there are long, narrow streets barely wide enough for a car. And people were lined up at bakeries for fresh bread this morning and also lined up at a polling place. So the polling place is here in a mosque. Got to take off our shoes. Nice little lockers. Step inside. People fill out paper ballots and drop them in a plastic box. And some of those ballots were for President Rouhani's challenger Ebrahim Raisi. Now for Americans, this election is mainly about the nuclear deal. But for many Iranians, the election, like U.S. elections, is really about the economy. I met a man named Gholamhosein Keshavarzi who said all he wants is a raise in his job in the ministry of education. Which presidential candidate do you think will do that? GHOLAMHOSEIN KESHAVARZI: Raisi (Laughter). INSKEEP: You're for Raisi. KESHAVARZI: Raisi (laughter) OK. INSKEEP: Both of you, Raisi? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Foreign language spoken). INSKEEP: You hear a second man chiming in there. And he said Raisi can save the country - save it, he says, from a lousy economy and poverty. There's a lot of economic discontent here, although there is also a lot of support for President Rouhani, as we saw moving around Tehran. There's nothing scientific about this, but we were at the polling place in an area that's presumed to be for Raisi, the challenger. And turnout was pretty light. Here in a big pro Rouhani area, there's a very long line to get into the mosque. You know, this was in the midmorning Tehran time, Rachel. MARTIN: Yeah. INSKEEP: Hundreds of people were in line. It's Iran, so there was one line for men and one line for women. And people in both lines spoke to me of the president as a man who could improve the economy and also bring greater social freedom, which they really want. MARTIN: OK. So here's my question - Rouhani has already been president for four years. He did the nuclear deal. But it's widely understood he hasn't been able to make a whole lot of social changes. So what would it mean - how significant would it be if he loses? INSKEEP: Well, a lot of his supporters would take that very hard because they say he has allowed a little more space for free expression and the press in this country. I spoke this week with Maryam Abdi who says she favors more rights for women. President Rouhani hasn't delivered that yet, but she sees him as the only hope. And she's been volunteering this year to work for a political party that supports him. Let's listen. What if Rouhani loses? MARYAM ABDI: (Through interpreter) There is no plan B. A politician here would say maybe, it's no problem. We can just find a way to go out. With 38 years of age, I do not really have any plan. I do not know what to do. INSKEEP: She was saying this in a political campaign office where we were surrounded by dozens of posters showing the face of the man that she's desperate, really, to keep in office. MARTIN: So you have been to Iran, Steve, multiple times. I'm just wondering how this trip feels to you. Does it feel more open? Does it feel different? INSKEEP: It feels more open. It does feel different over time. But when you talk with people privately, you still hear how jittery they are and how complex it is to live in a society that has features of a democracy but is also authoritarian. It's a strange, strange world. MARTIN: NPR's Steve Inskeep in Tehran - thanks, Steve. INSKEEP: Glad to do it, Rachel. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "On Friday, Iran's centrist President Hassan Rouhani stands for a second term in office, facing a hard line cleric most Iranians know little about. Ebrahim Raisi has highlighted economic, not religious, arguments to garner support.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Iran is holding a presidential election on Friday. One of the main contenders is a hard-line cleric. He's said to have played a role in the executions of political dissenters in the past. His name is Ebrahim Raisi. His economic agenda has made him a top challenger to the incumbent president, Hasan Rouhani. NPR's Peter Kenyon is in Tehran and talked to people about how the campaign is gaining strength. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Ebrahim Raisi, conservative cleric and former judiciary official, is the surprise candidate of the race. Iranians say they know very little about the man who is now the main challenger to President Hasan Rouhani. To see why, I went to a rally where thousands of Raisi supporters turned out to urge their man on to victory. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in foreign language). KENYON: The crowd waved flags and chanted, by the end of the week, Rouhani is gone. The mood was festive, but Raisi's message is not. He says President Rouhani was weak in his negotiations with Western powers and has failed to deliver the economic benefits he promised. In the poor neighborhoods of South Tehran, there's ample evidence of grinding poverty. Most people here have stories of hard times. I met Hossein Hashemi at a Raisi campaign office in South Tehran where a handful of men had a lively political discussion of sorts about whether it was OK to talk to a foreign journalist or not. But Hashemi, neatly dressed and freshly shaved, then invited me to see his place just around the corner. It turns out he's only a volunteer here. He works as a plasterer when he can find work, which isn't often. And his wife does arts and crafts work for about $10 a week. Down an alley and through a gate, we reach a small, rectangular, concrete space with no furniture. Then Hashemi opens a side door to show me what's next door - a row of parked cars. HOSSEIN HASHEMI: (Foreign language spoken). KENYON: So this is actually garages? HASHEMI: A garage, yeah. KENYON: You live in a garage, wow. Hashemi says he lives in a garage because apartment rents are prohibitive, and even here, their income doesn't cover the rent and utilities. He's expecting to be evicted, and his wife is pregnant with their first child. HASHEMI: (Through interpreter) We cannot continue to live. The electricity, the rent, gas has broken our back. KENYON: Away from the campaign office, Hashemi says he has no idea if Raisi will improve things, but they certainly haven't gotten better under four years of Rouhani. Ordinary Iranians may not know much about Raisi, but his name has been mentioned for a higher office - that of Iran's next supreme leader. Raisi has come in for criticism regarding his work as a prosecutor and judge during a bloody period in Iran's history. Human rights groups say he served on a so-called death commission that ordered the execution of thousands of dissidents in the late 1980s. Those killings are still something of a taboo subject here. They've never been officially investigated, and Raisi has avoided the subject during the campaign. Most Iranians I met either said they didn't know much about the executions or didn't want to talk about them. One man said he would talk if his name wasn't used and then defended Raisi's actions. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Through interpreter) Those people who were killed - they took up arms against the state, and so they were executed. The punishment fit the crime. KENYON: In fact, rights groups say the deadly purge included not only militants but large numbers of leftists and other nonviolent dissidents. As election day nears, it's unclear how much of an impact Raisi's past might have. Much will depend on who turns out to vote on Friday - people willing to give Hasan Rouhani more time to lift the economy by engaging with the outside world or those who seek a return to a more inward-looking and conservative Iran.

            "article_content": "A fire in the Bronx in New York City has left at least 12 people dead. Also, Doug Jones has been certified as the winner of Alabama's Senate election and Liberians have elected a new president.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: President Trump is expected to be ringing in the New Year from Florida. NOEL KING, HOST: Yeah, the president's been celebrating the holidays there. He's been hitting the golf course. And that's where he was yesterday when a reporter for The New York Times caught up with him. Now, The Times says it was a 30-minute impromptu sit-down after the president finished lunch. And they talked about a bunch of things, including the U.S.-China relationship and the Russia investigation. GREENE: And we have NBC's White House Correspondent Geoff Bennett here in the studio with us, also a familiar voice on our airwaves. Hey there, Geoff. It's good to see you. GEOFF BENNETT, BYLINE: You too. Good morning. GREENE: So the biggest headline here seems to be these comments from the president about the Russia investigation, right? BENNETT: Yeah. GREENE: Walk us through what he said. BENNETT: So President Trump told The New York Times' Michael Schmidt that he expects Robert Mueller to treat him fairly but that the investigation, in the president's words, quote, \"make the country look very bad, and it puts the country in a very bad position.\" And Trump, David, in this interview insists 16 times that Mueller has found, what he says, is no collusion between his campaign and Russia. GREENE: Only 16 times. BENNETT: Only 16 times. Of course, we don't know that yet because the special counsel investigation is, of course, not yet over. But the president is framing this as bad for the country. He says so the sooner it's worked out, the better it is for the country. Those are the president's words. GREENE: Interesting he says that Mueller's going to treat him fairly because a lot of his allies have been suggesting that there's bias within the FBI and within Mueller's camp. So he seems to be getting away from some of his allies in that respect. BENNETT: Yeah. GREENE: He - 16 times talking about collusion, talking about Mueller, talking about how he thinks this investigation looks. You cover this White House. Is he obsessed with this Russia investigation? BENNETT: Obsessed with wanting it to be over. Look. The investigation is taking a lot longer than the president had hoped to, based on the guidance of his own lawyers. Ty Cobb, one of the president's lawyers, said that the Russia probe would be likely finished shortly sometime in the new year. But that, of course, does not seem to be the case. Legal experts - I think also historical precedent suggests that this investigation could last well into 2018 - perhaps even into the midterm elections, which, of course, presents a whole, you know, different sort of political problems for this president. I think the biggest question, looking into next year, is when will the president sit and be interviewed by the special counsel. I can tell you that as of last week that interview had not yet happened, according to a source familiar. But legal experts I've spoken with say that they fully expect the president to sit for an interview with the special counsel. They say it's highly unlikely that this investigation could conclude without that happening. GREENE: I was really struck that this interview seemed so impromptu. I mean, he finished his lunch and then decides to sit down with the New York Times with no aides even there. There was some nice details in The New York Times story. Did you learn anything about this president? BENNETT: Well, I learned that the president - these are the sort of situations in which the president feels most comfortable talking to reporters, right? It was this impromptu interview happening around a table at the golf course, where the president had just finished golfing with some of his friends. GREENE: He's in his comfort zone. BENNETT: His comfort zone - and what's interesting about it is this. The president left Washington without having conducted that traditional end-of-year press conference, which typically happens in the East Room or in the Rose Garden. The entire White House Press Corps is able to ask questions. They're able to ask follow-up questions if an answer seems a little evasive. The president saw fit to give this interview on his own terms to Michael Schmidt. Of course, this is a president who finds it politically useful to discredit media organizations, including The New York Times. GREENE: Yeah. BENNETT: Of course, there is always a disconnect between what he says and what he does. This president, of course, giving this one-on-one interview, again, to the New York Times. GREENE: NBC White House Correspondent Geoff Bennett in our studios this morning. Geoff, thanks. And Happy New Year. BENNETT: You too. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, some really tragic news from New York City this morning. At least 12 people are dead after a fire broke out in an apartment building in the Bronx. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BILL DE BLASIO: We're here at the scene of an unspeakable tragedy. This will rank as one of the worst losses of life to a fire in many, many years. KING: That was New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio. He went to the scene last night. And de Blasio says the victims include a 1-year-old child. Several other people are in critical condition. GREENE: One of the journalists covering this fire is Angus Chen, who joins us from New York. Hi, Angus. ANGUS CHEN, BYLINE: Hi. GREENE: I know you have spent the early hours of the morning in touch with city officials. What are you learning about this blaze? CHEN: The blaze? It sounds like it started around 6:51 p.m. just before - or just before 6:51 p.m. The fire department got a call at that time and was on the scene just a few minutes after that. It says - they said that it took them about two hours to fight the fire. I spoke with a representative from the fire department, and he said it's always harder to fight a fire in the cold. And last night, it was really cold, and it was also very windy. And they didn't put them out until just after 9 o'clock p.m. There are four people who are in critical condition in the hospital as of last night - late last night. And two - there were three other injuries. Two were serious but not life-threatening. And one was a minor injury that was sort of let go right away. GREENE: All right, so this death toll could actually go up. We're talking about - what? - like a five-story apartment building in the Bronx. What is this location? CHEN: That's exactly right. It's a five-story building in the Belmont area of the Bronx. This is right next to the Bronx Zoo and really close to the Bronx's historical Little Italy district. GREENE: Do we know what caused this? CHEN: We don't know what caused this. Right now, the fire department is only saying the fire began on the first floor and quickly moved up the building. But the - so city officials will be on the scene for maybe the next day or two as they try to figure out what started the fire. GREENE: There are some reports though that this building had some known violations, right? I mean, is - I wonder if that's a common problem in New York City and if the mayor and city officials think, you know, this is a reminder they have to do something about that. CHEN: You know, the fire department didn't comment about that to me. But it is a often talked about problem in New York City. I'm not exactly sure how the city or the mayor's office will be responding to it at this time. GREENE: All right, reporter Angus Chen, who's speaking to us on Skype from New York about a tragic fire that's killed at least 12 people in the Bronx in an apartment building. Angus, thanks for your reporting. CHEN: Sure, thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK, Liberia has a new president-elect, and his supporters are ecstatic. They have been celebrating in the streets of the capital, Monrovia, and chanting his name, George Weah. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) George. KING: The former soccer-turned-politician beat the incumbent vice president in a runoff election. He won more than 60 percent of the vote. Weah was a compelling candidate. He has a rags-to-riches story, and he cultivated an image as the candidate of the people and the youth. He'll succeed Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. She was Africa's first woman elected president, and this was Liberia's first peaceful democratic handover in generations. GREENE: And we have NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton on the line. Hi, Ofeibea. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: Greetings. GREENE: So George Weah wins this election by a handsome margin. Can you tell us a little more about this former soccer star? QUIST-ARCTON: Let me tell you first that he's tweeted and said, my fellow Liberians, I deeply feel the emotion of all the nation. I measured the importance and the responsibility of the immense task, which I embrace today. Change is on. And that is really important because George Weah really represents change. We've said that he has the rags-to-riches story. He was brought up in the shantytowns around the capital Monrovia. He was brought up poor. And then he became an international soccer star, the only African who's ever been named the global player of the year by FIFA, the global soccer world body. And then he retired and took up politics. This is his second bid for president, and he has won. Weah is not of the political or social elite from the settler stock - of freed enslaved Americans who declared Liberia a republic in 1847. He is very much seen as different - that he doesn't come from that stock. This also comes with some problems because people say he doesn't have enough education. He doesn't have enough experience. But he is certainly a determined man. GREENE: Well, determined but certainly facing challenges that are huge. I mean, years of civil war - right? - and the Ebola outbreak, which so devastated the country. I mean, is - he's facing the immense task as he put it in that tweet. QUIST-ARCTON: And indeed he has a tough act to follow because Nobel Peace Prize-winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the outgoing president, is Harvard-educated. She's an international economist. And yet many Liberians say she has consolidated peace. She has brought us stability after these civil wars and during Ebola. But she has not lifted Liberians out of poverty so that many - especially unemployed young men in a country where unemployment is huge - youth unemployment - are looking to George Weah to deliver on these. It's a very, very tough call. GREENE: When we hear that excitement in the streets of the capital, Ofeibea, how deep does that optimism run? I mean, is there doubt that this country is so fragile, and someone coming in with very little experience might not be able to handle this job? QUIST-ARCTON: And with that enthusiasm come expectations, as we've said. This is - it's true. The first peaceful transfer of power from one elected administration to another in Liberia. But, you know, people question. His running mate is Jewel Howard Taylor who is the ex-wife of Charles Taylor, former warlord and former Liberian president who is in jail for war crimes. Is he going to be, you know, twiddling and being the puppeteer - the puppet master while Weah is the puppet? Many questions yet unanswered, but there is a lot of hope in Liberia today. GREENE: NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton speaking to us from her base in Dakar, Senegal. Ofeibea, thanks as always. QUIST-ARCTON: Always a pleasure. Thank you, David.

Michael Eagle II, not yet the art-rapper known now as Open Mike Eagle, was just a Windy City kid on the cusp of manhood at the time. Raised on the Southside, he'd spent much of his formative years in Robert Taylor, where his aunt and first cousins lived. The 28 high-rises, 4,321 apartments and 11,000 bodies occupying them in 1998 were more than stats and figures to him, they were his people. Now, 10 years after the completion of its demolition, he's resurrecting Robert Taylor, brick by living brick. On his forthcoming concept album, Brick Body Kids Still Daydream (out Sept. 15 on Mello Music Group), Open Mike Eagle humanizes the victims of one of the largest urban renewal \u2014 a.k.a. negro removal \u2014 projects in the last half century of America. The idea to record an album that serves as \"a vivid, comic book-style reimagining of the Homes,\" as Eagle tells NPR, came to him out of thin air. During an airplane flight, he pulled out his laptop and felt compelled to watch a couple of documentaries about the life of the Robert Taylor and its demolition (similar to The Pruitt-Igoe Myth, a film about the 33-building St. Louis housing project torn down in the mid-'70s). \"I watched it and was transfixed by it, and hurt,\" Eagle, who's resided in L.A. since the late-'90s and was part of the Project Blowed collective, says, explaining how similar feelings of darkness resonated with him throughout the 2016 presidential election. \"I thought about the policy of erecting and destroying housing for black people, and the link I perceive between what happens to those buildings and what happens to black people's bodies when they are murdered by the police. It all hurt a lot and stressed me out. I decided to go harder at it with my writing.\" Open Mike Eagle, Brick Body Kids Still Daydream\n\n                    \n                    Mello Music Group\n                    \n                \nhide caption Open Mike Eagle, Brick Body Kids Still Daydream Rappers have rhymed about housing projects since hip-hop's beginning, to be sure. When it comes to the politics of place, there is no home base more synonymous with the birth of the genre. For the better half of the twentieth century, these brick monstrosities served as warehouses of poverty and inequality in urban centers throughout the country; hip-hop provided a voice for an otherwise forgotten demographic. On \"Brick Body Complex,\" Open Mike Eagle fuses the source and its voice, literally becoming the building as he delivers a defiant blues. \"Don't call me n**** or rapper / My motherf****** name is Michael Eagle / I'm sovereign / I'm from a line of ghetto superheroes,\" he raps over drum-and-synth track as angsty as his survival narrative. \"I will never fit in your descriptions / I'm giant / Don't let nobody tell you nothing different / They lying / A giant and my body is a building, a building, a building, a building.\" Both the song and Eagle's fifth solo LP comprise an ambitious attempt to deconstruct and examine a warped mythology that reduces housing project residents to violence-prone, drug-addled subhumans. The equally conceptual video, directed by Nikki Born, is another entry in Eagle's \"Dark Comedy Television\" video series, in which each visual accompanying the album serves as a TV short on an imaginary network. This one features Eagle portraying a traumatized superhero who tries to save the building from demolition by an unknown villain, who seems to represent the nefarious market forces or nameless bureaucrats that represent the system. However you interpret the faceless antagonist, it embodies the idea that gentrification is violence. \"This is about trauma. It's about how 30,000 residents were displaced and only one-third of them are accounted for \u2014 and there are no AMBER alerts for the other two-thirds,\" Eagle says. \"This is about the pain of that. And how black life in America seems to run parallel with painful events that we're not supposed to talk about, because America doesn't really want to hear it. This song and album is about how those buildings were torn down and replaced with nothing \u2014 not a new highway or a football field. Nothing at all.\" The promised redevelopment of the land where the Robert Taylor Homes once stood remains behind schedule. But the large-scale dispersal gang members and criminals that occurred during the Robert Taylor upheaval proves that the one thing missing from national conversations around gentrification and the crisis of violence in inner cities like Chicago is the humanity. \"We are missing people,\" Eagle adds. \"We are literally missing 20,000 people. A lot of them died. Some of the ones that didn't were young gangbangers and hustlers that got moved into rival territory or maybe across the street from their enemies. A lot of hardened people moved to soft places. That hardening is a very difficult process to reverse. It's like a living rigor mortis.\" Brick Body Kids Still Daydream comes out Sept. 15 via Mello Music Group.",

            "article_content": "Mayor Bill de Blasio this week pushed ahead with plans to make New York City one of nation's few big cities to offer free, full-day preschool for all 3-year-olds\u00ad\u00ad. The plan would serve, when fully rolled out over several years, more than 60,000 children a year. It builds on one of de Blasio's signature accomplishments of his first term \u2013 universal pre-K for 4-year-olds. A few places, including Washington, D.C., have made a serious effort to fund preschool for 3-year-olds. New York City's plan, when fully realized, would be the most ambitious such effort to date. To achieve this goal the mayor says he'll need significant help from the state and federal government: upwards of $700 million dollars. And he faces the political tussles that will surely accompany his financing challenges. The mayor is running for re-election. But his proposal builds on widespread consensus that high-quality pre-K programs can have a huge positive impact on the lives of children \u2013 especially low-income ones \u2013 as well as on the parents and family. That's the crux of the study The Life-Cycle Benefits of an Influential Early Childhood Program, co-authored by Nobel laureate James Heckman, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and the director of the Center for the Economics of Human Development. There's a growing body of research on the value and importance of high-quality early education programs \u2014 especially for disadvantaged kids. But there's surprisingly little research on its impact over time. This paper helps change that. Heckman and his co-authors examine the many ways in which high-quality programs helped participants thrive throughout life. The paper analyzes two North Carolina programs founded in the 1970s that worked with infants from 8 weeks old through age 5. The rub for researchers: The programs included data collection from birth through age 8 on a wide range of school and home life factors as well as long-term follow-ups through age 35. Quality early education programs are expensive upfront. But as Heckman argues, the returns are enormous; the investment well worth it. Your study found enduring positive effects of quality pre-K on a lot of things, including future earnings, health, IQ and crime reduction. Is the bottom line here stronger, fuller, richer lives? Yes it is, but it's more than just stronger, richer, fuller lives for the children. It's also stronger, richer, fuller lives for the mothers of the children. Let me explain why. In America today we have a lot of single-parent families. We have a lot of mothers who are working. What we've done is shown the benefits across two generations of the study of these enriched early child care programs. Not only providing child care for working mothers \u2014 allowing them to get more education \u2014 but primarily to get more work experience, higher earnings gains through participating in the workforce, but also getting high-quality child care environments that turn out to be developmentally rich. It promotes social mobility within \u2014 and across \u2014 generations. That I think is an important finding of this study. Tell us about the two programs you've studied, serving mostly lower-income, predominantly African-American families. The program starts very early. The children are 8 weeks old. It stays with the children until they're age 5. It's a program that runs nine hours a day, so it's very child care-friendly in the sense that women could leave their children at the child care center and then go on to work. They provide these disadvantaged children with enriched family environments: more verbal attention, more enrichment and parenting resources available to disadvantaged, predominantly African-American women, as you say, and single-parent women. It supplements the early lives. In addition, it gives health care screenings for children 0 to 5. The pediatrician has access to the treatment group. The pediatrician then would suggest what health indications should be taken. What kind of steps, what kind of treatment might be taken. Doesn't pay for the treatment but it does essentially screen the children and alert parents to the need for treatment. This is true wrap-around service and personalized attention? Yes. Turns out one of the most effective ingredients for these early child care programs is interacting with the child. What I mean by interacting is a give-and-take. The term that's used by the child development specialist is scaffolding, like building a sculpture \u2014 in this case of a human being. Staying with the child, taking the child to the next step, challenging the child. In that sense it's very personalized education. It's very time-intensive education, but it's education that stays with the child. It also has another effect, which is that it engages, through the enhanced stimulation of the child, the parent. Parents themselves visit the center, so that there is also stimulation of the parent-child relationship that lasts long after the program itself is formally ended at age 5. This kind of comprehensive program is more costly upfront? For sure. The main benefit of this study is, if you count all of the benefits that accrue from this program in terms of reduced health care costs, reduced crime, greater earnings, more education, higher IQ \u2014 the list is quite long. Those all are monetized. We can compute a rate of return, the dividend would be from the investment. You get about 13 percent per annum. Much higher than the annual return on equities in the U.S. stock market post-Second World War through the 2008 meltdown. Yeah I'd like 13 percent on my 401(k) every year. Exactly. This is a huge, huge investment return. It competes favorably with almost any other public program. What was the (annual) per-pupil spending while these children were in the program? Per-year it's probably about $16,000 to $18,000. It depends on what (year) dollars you use. It's expensive. That is pretty high. You're saying you get what you pay for? Well, yes, it's a lot. But what are you getting in return? You're getting hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Seven to eight hundred thousand dollars back for what is essentially an $80,000 to $85,000 expenditure. Yes, it costs more but we can go back and think: In its time the transcontinental railroad that Abraham Lincoln launched, the Hoover Dam, the transcontinental highway system that Eisenhower launched. These all were very costly, but they also led to enormous social benefits. These programs have enormous social benefit. They help to solve a lot of social problems. The way public policy is discussed frequently in this country is through silos. People say, \"We want to reduce crime. We want to promote health.\" We do what is, I think, a very limited kind of notion: looking at one problem at a time and one solution very closely linked to that problem. I would encourage people who see the price tag to also look at the benefit tag. They're well-documented. You followed these young people well into adulthood? That's the benefit of the study. The children in the study essentially are much healthier than their counterparts who did not participate in the study. That came as a surprise to some people, but it shouldn't be a surprise. Not only did they get the health screening, but they also developed these social and emotional skills: self-control, the ability to monitor. They had more education, therefore they had more information. In a number of ways these children became more engaged, control their own lives better, and that shows up in their adult health. What is turning out from this body of research is that promoting engagement of children, their cognitive and noncognitive skills, boosting their IQs, at the same time boosting their social engagement, their willingness to participate in society, monitoring their health from an early age, is having huge benefits downstream for the rest of their lives. You mentioned the return on investment. But you've also documented health benefits, crime reduction and parental benefits including boosted income and lower obesity rates. Talk about that a little. That's folded into what we have for a measure of the rate of return. You can actually monetize the cost of the criminal justice system, the cost of incarcerating people and so forth. You can also talk about the benefits of reduced health care expenditures, higher-quality of life and so forth. All of that's incorporated into our rates of return and benefit-cost ratio. Breaking out these components, one of the most surprising findings from a study that we did published in Science magazine a couple of years ago. We showed that children who are in this program were much less likely to be obese, to have hypertension, to have precursor environments that would promote diabetes. You mentioned the poisonous effect of the silofication \u2014 if we could call it that \u2014 in combating poverty. Looking at social challenges largely in isolation. This is also a hyper-partisan age. What do you think policymakers and politicians are missing when it comes to looking at early childhood education? Some leading politicians both Republicans and Democrats are not missing. They're well aware of it. What's really interesting is that if you go out to those red states that were called fly-over states in the last election, the ones in the Midwest and the ones that people frequently ignore. It's states like Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, that have been some of the most vigorous in promoting early childhood development. The reason is that it's based on an economic efficiency argument and it also promotes what is an agenda that's frequently very common in some of those states about family values. It's really about helping bolster the American family, which I think is under attack, it's under transformation. It's simply that we have many more single-parent families. We have many more mothers who are working because they have to support their families. You've said the ultimate risk factor in the complex poverty equation is lack of parental engagement. Talk about that and what these programs you studied did in terms of parental engagement? It's not about getting toys that rotate or getting a particular program online to stimulate the kid. That can't hurt, but it's not the story. It's the engagement. It's \"Johnny or Sally, here let's look at this together, let's go to the zoo, let's look at this book, let's see what we're doing.\" It's that engagement. When you engage the parent in that process, you help them bolster their arrangement, then I think you actually will keep in place over the life of the child a very strong very beneficial environment. The center core is engagement. That's what good teaching's about too when you think about it. I don't think I'm saying anything that's revolutionary, but I do think I'm saying something that is frequently ignored in public policy. We think about a bricks-and-mortar approach to what education is about. That's exactly the wrong way to think about it. It's not a teacher lecturing to a student, it's basically the teachers or child care workers engaging students or engaging these young children and making age-adapted, person-adjusted interventions. I think that's the key. What do these programs have that helps foster that engagement? It turns out that many of the disadvantaged families have a mode of discouraging the child. Saying, \"Don't do this, don't do that,\" and on and on. The alternative is to actually have a family that encourages the child and supports the child in making mistakes and learning from mistakes, but also in engaging the child to explore the world. It's this attachment and this support that really plays a fundamental role I think in the structure of essential programs. That's an example where you would literally take the child, read to the child, engage the child, and then you would show the parent, bring the parent into the center. Show how successful the child has been and then send the child home. When the child goes home the child is more engaged and also therefore engaging the parent. We found that. We found that as a byproduct: much more parental engagement among those who got the treatment compared to those who were randomized out into the control group. And these were lifetime effects. If you look at disadvantaged children you'll find that they're getting about a third or a fourth as many words per hour as more advantaged children. The environments are fundamentally different. Over the lifetime, their young childhood \u2014 a period of say 0 to 5 \u2014 you're getting a millions of words deficit between those who are advantaged and those who aren't advantaged. That essentially is one way to close the gap. By literally reading to the child, by encouraging the child. As you know there's been a big emphasis on what constitutes high-quality child care centers. What elements are vital to create these great early learning centers? There's this enormous body of evidence talking about parent-child interaction. The structure of a successful [center] would be one that encourages those interactions, that fostered those. Are we talking about empathy? Well, yes, we're talking about empathy, and we're talking about the structure of engagement with the child, and at the core of successful programs is parenting. It's not so much having a pretty building. There's a whole mentality out there that says, \"We have a textbook notion about what constitutes a good school. The teachers must have a certain level of educational attainment.\" There have been a lot of studies, serious studies, that show that many of these so-called guides to what makes a good teacher \u2014 in terms of things like number of degrees or number of teacher credits and on and on and on \u2014 are really worthless in terms of predicting who's a good teacher. What is important is finding this empathy, this ability to work with people, the engagement. By empathy all I really mean is, you work with a child, you stay with a child, a child asks questions, you answer the questions. You don't discourage the questions and you promote them. At the same time you have a firm line where you say, \"Yeah that's a mistake. You could go do a little better,\" and so forth. We need a national empathy project, Professor Heckman. Probably could use it across the board and not just in early childhood! An earlier version of this story ran on NPR Ed in December, 2016.",

Editor's note: This story contains language that may be offensive to some readers. Hate incidents can happen anywhere: the mall, the church, the office. But, in the wake of the 2016 election, hate's been showing up a lot in school. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in the months following the election more hate incidents took place in America's schools than anywhere else. Hundreds of elementary, middle and high schools have played host to an array of troubling events, from sophomoric stunts to much worse: a hijab pulled off a Muslim student, physical fights with racial epithets flung, even violent threats. Educators in Massachusetts, as elsewhere, are struggling with what to do. In Medway, a video began circulating showing a student with a rifle, saying the N-word and \"kill 'em all.\" This was just one of dozens of school incidents called in to a hate hotline set up by the Massachusetts attorney general. One concerned parent called to ask about getting a restraining order. The staffer answering the phone explained the law and promised to follow up to make sure school and local law enforcement officials were taking it seriously. \"It's especially concerning that a child was responsible,\" the staffer offered sympathetically. \"And this is exactly the reason we started this hotline, so we really appreciate you taking the time to call.\" But along with the anxious parents, schools themselves are also calling with their own concerns about how to handle it all. As Attorney General Maura Healey puts it, when it comes to student behavior, \"there's right and there's wrong.\" But it's not always as clear what crosses the line, legally. Brookline High School students Ari Lazowski (left) and Iman Khan practice presenting an exercise on cyberbullying.\n                \n                    \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Brookline High School students Ari Lazowski (left) and Iman Khan practice presenting an exercise on cyberbullying. \"There is speech that may be ugly, that may be hateful, that may be harmful, but that may nevertheless be protected in certain instances,\" says Healey. \"So schools have reached out to our office for assistance, and we are here to help them.\" A high school in Attleboro called for help after finding pro-Trump graffiti in the boys' bathroom. It included a warning about how the KKK would \"handle\" African Americans \u2014 again using the N-word. \"This one was one that they don't teach you in Administration 101 classes,\" says Attleboro High School Principal Bill Runey. \"There's no playbook for this.\" Indeed, many schools are figuring it out as they go. They're grappling with how to prevent and respond to incidents, often under enormous pressure and amid public outcry. Some have come under fire \u2013- and investigation \u2014 for failing to report incidents. Administrators say they have to strike a delicate balance between being transparent and not giving offenders undue attention or provoking copycats. But Massachusetts Teachers Association President Barbara Madelonie says some schools are bungling cases because their first instinct is to avoid making headlines. \"I have seen administrators seem to want to run away from the issue,\" Madelonie says. \"I think people are sort of back on their heels. They get caught up in a sense of 'I'll take care of this' \u2014 and that's troubling!\" Stoughton High School recently took heat for being too soft on a student who hung a swastika at school \u2014 and too tough on the teachers who spoke out about it. One teacher was suspended for 20 days after calling a college to withdraw her recommendation for the student. Teachers are allowed to revoke a recommendation, but they must also follow strict rules about discussing student misconduct. Superintendent Marguerite Rizzi would not speak specifically to that case, but in general, she says, the district takes very seriously both student misconduct and student privacy. \"It is a complicated balance,\" she says. \"But I do have to step in and make sure that everyone's rights are protected, even a person who has engaged in behavior for which they are punished. There are still rights that they have.\" Schools especially, Rizzi says, must strike a balance between punishing offenders and educating them. \"You want somebody who has done something, let's say, really stupid at the age of 16 or 17 \u2014 when they're 18, to say 'Oh my gosh, I would never do that now!'\" says Rizzi. \"They're going to be among us, and if they haven't learned something, then they're just angrier people when they come out than when they went in.\" One of the gold standards in teaching tolerance is a program run by the Anti-Defamation League called \"A World Of Difference.\" The number of schools calling and asking for the program has jumped five-fold recently. Brookline High School reached out after being hit with two incidents of racist and anti-Semitic graffiti. Administrators recruited 30 students to go through three full days of training \u2014 to learn to run tolerance workshops for their peers. \"Ok, folks! Showtime!\" bellows the ADL's New England Senior Training Consultant Rob Jones from the front of a gymnasium. His dreadlocks swinging out from under a felt fedora, Jones bounces around the circle of students, grilling them on what they've learned from the exercises they've done so far and getting them ready to be leaders instead of participants. They begin by practicing how they will introduce themselves to classmates when they run a workshop. Rob Jones, a training consultant with the Anti-Defamation League, leads Brookline High School students in building a \"web of unity.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Tovia Smith /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rob Jones, a training consultant with the Anti-Defamation League, leads Brookline High School students in building a \"web of unity.\" \"My name is Josh Gladstone,\" starts one. \"I'm doing this program because I have seen many issues at the high school, and even though we attempt to have a couple of assemblies, I don't think it's enough.\" The students role-play and rehearse everything from ice-breakers to exercises meant to encourage empathy and bystander intervention. Jones coaches and corrects. \"You don't wanna preach,\" he tells one. \"You do not wanna come off as better than [them]... like you really need to help them. We've all laughed at jokes we shouldn't have laughed at and made comments we shouldn't have made. We're all trying to learn together.\" After participating in tolerance workshops for two days, Maddie Kennedy (left), Josh Gladstone and Raven Bogues practice being presenters before they run the same workshops for their peers.\n                \n                    \n                    Tovia Smith /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indeed, even in their left-leaning \"bubble\" \u2014 as some Brookline students call it \u2014 they've seen an uptick in hate. Junior Talia Vos, who moved to Brookline from Mexico, says she felt it the day after the election. She was in the hallway between classes and yelled out to a friend \u2013- in Spanish \u2014 to save her a seat. \"A group of boys behind me, they started chanting, 'build a wall!'\" she recalls. \"It's just these new social norms of how we treat each other.\" After 30 years of doing this work, Rob Jones worries that many of the communities that need these programs the most are also in denial. \"Certain populations just won't talk about it because they don't get it \u2014 they don't get it,\" he says. \"They're like, 'we don't have any issues.' But boy, they have a lot of bigoted behavior.\" Along with prevention, many schools these days are also quickly learning the art of \"the healing response.\" In Brookline, after the hateful graffiti was found, students banded together to re-paint the table that was vandalized to \"reclaim it from hate.\" Other schools have called in professional facilitators to moderate a \"community conversation.\" Following the KKK graffiti in Attleboro, dozens of students mobilized to counter the hate with kindness. They wrote \"love notes\" to each of the high school's nearly 2000 students, staffers and teachers.",

Sam Brownback opposes legislative efforts to expand the state's Medicaid program. Kansas state Sen. Barbara Bollier is a Republican who has been fighting for years to get her colleagues to agree to expand Medicaid. For years she pushed against what she described as a \"Tea Party-ish\" Senate and a governor who wouldn't consider the issue. In return for her efforts, she was stripped of her committee assignments and sidelined. But in last November's election, the makeup of the Kansas legislature moved decidedly to the center. And last week, the state's Senate joined the House in agreeing to expand eligibility for Medicaid, the government health program for the poor, to about 150,000 more Kansans. \"This has been a long time and a hard road,\" Bollier said in an interview shortly after the vote. The vote had reverberations back in Washington, D.C., because it came just days after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives failed in their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. That failure breathed new life into efforts in the states expand Medicaid as the law allows. In all, 31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid after the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. The majority acted so that the expansion went into effect in 2014. A handful of states, including Louisiana and Montana, that first rejected the expansion have since embraced it. But those efforts face the same political and ideological fights that have plagued health care policy in Washington, You could hear the echoes in Topeka last week. State Sen. Ty Masterson, a Republican, urged his colleagues to reject expanding Medicaid because it was part of the Affordable Care Act. He likened the federal health law to a broken amusement park ride. \"We're standing at an amusement park ride that's closed. It's broken. And we're saying we want to go ahead and get on the ride,\" Masterson said. \"There is a reason there is nobody in line behind us. Sign's up: 'Out of Order.' I don't want to be first in that line. I want to get out of that line.\" But Bollier says the Affordable Care Act is here to stay, and that makes taking federal money to expand health care to the poor, which has overwhelming support in the public, a no-brainer. \"I've never had anything like that in the legislature,\" she said. \"It was just overwhelming support. Not just support; begging, pleading, 'Please, we desperately need this in place.' \" Bollier is a doctor, the daughter of a doctor and a nurse. She says getting health care to the working poor shouldn't be a partisan issue. \"I have yet to meet a patient who comes in and says, 'I'm a Republican,' or 'I'm Democrat, so mete out my care accordingly,' \" she said. The law allows states to offer Medicaid coverage to people with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,400 for a single adult. It also extended eligibility to \"able-bodied\" adults with no children for the first time. But Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback didn't see it that way. On Thursday, he vetoed the bill. \"It fails to serve the truly vulnerable before the able-bodied, lacks work requirements to help able-bodied Kansans escape poverty, and burdens the state budget with unrestrainable entitlement costs,\" he said in a statement. Brownback said he also opposed it because it allowed government money to go the what he called \"the abortion industry.\" Bollier calls the governor's' arguments \"disingenuous.\" \"He keeps claiming we just can't afford this,\" she says. \"You afford what you choose. Where you place your money is a reflection of your value system.\" Now Bollier and other proponents are working furiously to change just two of their colleagues' minds in hopes of overriding that veto \u2014 perhaps as soon as Monday. About 1,200 miles due east from the fight in Topeka is Richmond, Va. When it comes to Medicaid expansion, the two capital cities are mirror images. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is a Democrat pushing his Republican legislature to expand Medicaid. \"I have had more excuses out of our Republican general assembly, none of them correct,\" McAuliffe tells Shots. \"The most recent argument was this was going to be repealed. Well, now it's not. It's not going away.\" McAuliffe says about 400,000 Virginians could be eligible for Medicaid under an expansion. And the Federal government would send $2.4 billion a year to the state to cover the costs. But the legislature in Richmond isn't buying it. In a statement, Virginia's Republicans said they're still against the proposal. \"The House Republican majority remains strongly opposed to implementing ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion in Virginia,\" the statement said. \"Virginia can barely afford our current program, much less an expansion. Every dollar spent on Medicaid is one less that can be spent on education, transportation or public safety.\" McAuliffe says the barrier is political. Among Virginia Republicans, the specter of U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor unexpectedly losing his primary battle two years ago looms large. \"My legislature is terrified of the Tea Party,\" McAuliffe says. \"That's the only reason they're not voting for it. Because they're afraid they'll get taken out in the primary, plain and simple.\" So in Virginia, expanding Medicaid remains a long shot. But up north, in Augusta, Maine, lawmakers have handed the question to the people after that state's governor vetoed measures passed by the legislature five different times. Tom Saviello is that state's representative for Franklin County, a poor rural district where many people have no health care coverage. Expanding Medicaid would make people healthier, bring in federal money and help the local hospital that's struggling to care for all the people who can't pay, he says. \"To me it was a no-brainer, absolutely a no-brainer,\" says Saviello, a Republican, in an interview. He sponsored bills to expand Medicaid in the past that were vetoed by Republican Gov. Paul LePage. Then on Election Day, a citizens group collected enough signatures \u2014 67,000 \u2014 in a single day to put the question to a referendum. Saviello says he withdrew his latest bill in order to let the public decide. \"Because we have the citizens' petition, we're putting it in the citizens' hands,\" he says. Polls show that 60 percent of Mainers want to expand Medicaid, Saviello says. So come November, he predicts: \"It's going to happen. It's coming.\" James McLean from member station KCUR in Kansas City, Mo., contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Micah White, co-creator of the Occupy Wall Street movement, now lives in Nehalem, Ore., where he's active in local politics. \"There are no big businesses here. These are all my neighbors. You can't block traffic,\" he says.\n                \n                    \n                    Trav Williams\n                    \n                \nhide caption Micah White, co-creator of the Occupy Wall Street movement, now lives in Nehalem, Ore., where he's active in local politics. \"There are no big businesses here. These are all my neighbors. You can't block traffic,\" he says. Opponents of President Trump say resistance to his policies is robust, motivated \u2014 and here to stay. They point to big demonstrations including January's Women's March and the upcoming Earth Day \"March for Science.\" Occupy Wall Street co-creator Micah White says bravo, but there's just one problem: Big street protests don't work. They're ineffectual, even counterproductive, he says. \"We could have large-scale marches for every year of Trump's presidency. It would do nothing!\" the activist and author tells me sitting in his kitchen in rural Nehalem, Ore., near the Pacific coast. \"You would think that with the triumph of Trump there would be a fundamental re-assessment among activists. But there hasn't been. They've just doubled down on the same behaviors!\" Instead, White argues, opponents of Trump should learn from Occupy's failure and run for local office. He encourages any progressive who'll listen: Go local, rural and small to try to foster big change. White did. He moved to Nehalem from Berkeley, Calif., a few years ago with his wife and young son. In his 2016 book, The End of Protest: A New Playbook For Revolution, White argues that America \"is ripe for a digital populist (an Internet-enabled people's democracy) uprising centered in the resource-rich rural areas\" of the Pacific Northwest. Work to create progressive pockets of power, he argues. Talk with those with whom you disagree. Last November, White put his theory into practice and ran for mayor of Nehalem, Ore. He lost. The campaign did not go smoothly. But exactly how White got crushed says something about America's hopes and political divisions along lines of class, place and race. Occupy Nehalem, Ore.: Population 280 \"Oh, it's so nice here!\" White says sounding more like a marketing rep for the Oregon tourism office than the revolutionary who helped spark a global protest movement against inequality and corporate greed. \"You can basically kayak, we've kayaked, from here all the way down to Wheeler,\" a few miles away, he adds while walking in the sun near the public dock along the picturesque Nehalem River. Almost on cue a kayaker comes into view up the river. \"There's really good salmon fishing right here,\" White gushes. We walk together through the one-traffic signal downtown along Highway 101 with its 10 or so locally owned small businesses. A sign at Hal's Emporium boasts \"dollar-ish bargains.\" We price near 99 cents seems a long way from the \"We Are The 99 Percent\" rallying slogan of the Occupy movement. \"What's so great about Nehalem is as an activist you can't use the other tactics. You can't block traffic,\" White says as we walk past a restaurant selling homemade chowders and ice cream. \"There are no big businesses here. These are all my neighbors. You can't block traffic.\" Read NPR's Extended Interview With Micah White White now sees those \"other tactics\" \u2014 including mass street protests and sit-ins \u2014 as almost futile. Protesters, he says, keep repeating the same mistakes: fetishizing the pageantry of protest and confusing online social marketing wins with real change. \"Success now has become something like getting a lot of people to hear about my meme,\" he says. \"We have become obsessed with the spectacle of street protest and we have started to ignore the reality that we are getting no closer to power.\" Budgets are sexy White reads the agenda for an upcoming council meeting posted on the door of city hall. \"On the new business - the economic development council update and the natural hazard mitigation plan.\" Put down the protest sign, he says, and pick up the city budget. Organize. Planning and zoning are sexy! The cornerstone of his ill-fated mayoral campaign was making government more responsive. He held open community meetings to hear concerns. \"We passionately debated things. People were on both sides \u2014 against and for,\" he says. \"It was like the first time, I think, that people from across the political spectrum who live in this tiny town sat in the same room together and debated things like, 'Change is happening in our community. How do we navigate it? What do we want it to look like in the future?' It was really beautiful.\" White says more people showed up to these gatherings than regularly attend city council meetings. But some residents say what White called People's Associations felt like awkward experiments. \"He came out swinging with this big laundry list of unrealistic ideas,\" says Tracey Curtis, who manages rental properties for the tourism industry \u2014 the area's economic core alongside timber. White's proposals to use the city's budget surplus for anti-poverty and education programs, she says, struck many as preachy and imprudent. \"That's not the way you make friends in a small town,\" she says at the bar of Nehalem's Bayway tavern and restaurant. \"I think he's just using our town as a stepping stone and a petri dish.\" Campaign gets ugly Micah White says as a black man moving to a small, rural, overwhelmingly white Oregon town, he was prepared for challenges and the possibility of prejudice. But White admits he did not see the whole devil-worshiping fake news rumor coming. \"People started asking me, 'are you a Satanist?' I was like, 'Whoa!' \" He admits he and his supporters were slow to respond. \"When it came down to their neighbors saying, 'Well, I heard he's a satanist.' My base wasn't strong enough to stand up and say, 'No, he's not a satanist, ya know. He's a good guy!' It was crazy.\" A counter-campaign cropped up complete with signs reading \"Keep Nehalem Nehalem.\" \"It's not a racist thing,\" says Nehalem resident Angela Hanke. \"It was a response to Micah saying he wants to change everything around here. It was keep our town the way it is because we're happy with it.\" But it got worse than a few bumper stickers and T-shirts. When White sent out a \"Micah for Mayor\" text blast to registered voters, one resident wrote back a racial slur telling him to pack his bags. A local article about the racist text created a storm. Instructive failure There are 194 registered voters in Nehalem, according to the city manager. On Election Day, Micah White got 36 votes. His opponent, incumbent Mayor William L. Dillard, Jr. got 139. \"It's awkward and painful, and you're a black guy living in rural Oregon talking about revolution and one out of five people really gets it and loves it. But 80 percent don't,\" White says and laughs. \"And do they want you to leave? Yes, they want you to leave.\" At the local tavern, resident Suzie Gruver was blunt. \"Nobody wants him here. He's trying to destroy our town.\" Still, White is undeterred. He sees his ill-fated mayoral run as an instructive failure \u2014 just like Occupy Wall Street. He still sits on the local budget committee, which he has served on for two years. He successfully advocated to get the city to use some of its budget surplus to help subsidize meals for hungry children who attend the local elementary school. He'd like the city to use more of its roughly $700,000 budget surplus on community needs. (\"It's not a surplus,\" Nehalem City Manager Dale Shafer says. It's more of a rainy day fund. \"You can't spend everything. You have to have money available in case of emergency,\" Shafer says.) White says he wants to learn from his stumbles. Listen more. Respond quicker to fake news devil worship stories. He plans to keep on testing his rural, populist plan to engage with the right and work to gain local power and influence. \"We could have activists take over small towns for the benefit of people who live there and the people who are going to move there, and actualize all of the grand ideas that we have on the left,\" he says. \"We have to do this. There is no other option. We could do protesting forever. And it would do nothing.\" Or, White says, people can figure out how they can own and not just occupy city hall. \"I think when we figure this one out,\" he says, smiling, \"it's going to be quite beautiful.\"",

            "article_content": "Recent executive orders on immigration have sparked an outpouring of donations from the general public, with national groups like the American Civil Liberties Union seeing the bulk of the financial windfall. For example, the ACLU recently raised $24 million in a single weekend. But with the spotlight on large nonprofits, some smaller, minority-led groups find that the focus on high-profile courtroom showdowns with the current administration has come at the expense of support for grass-roots work. \"For folks who are new to the issues of immigration or immigrant and refugee rights, [grass-roots groups] aren't the first thing that pops up on Google when you're trying to figure out what to donate your time or money to,\" said Tara Raghuveer, deputy director of the National Partnership for New Americans, which is a coalition of 37 regional immigrant and refugee-rights groups across 31 states. \"If you live in a family that has never had to ask the question of who is going to take care of my kids if I'm deported, you won't naturally think of the fact that you need a community-based organization or institution like a church or school to provide the information that isn't necessarily a legal consultation but supports people facing continuous anxiety and fear during these times,\" Raghuveer said. NPNA members provide rapid responses to urgent community needs from \"Know Your Rights\" workshops to assistance in formulating plans for what to do in case a family member is deported. While the organization has received increased support following the election, the demand for services has also risen. The U.S. is home to over 1.5 million charities, most of which are small organizations that deliver a wide range of services while financially challenged by their overhead. According to GuideStar, which reports on U.S. charities, only 10 percent of registered nonprofits have annual revenues of $500,000 or more. The headline-making donations following the presidential election are the exception rather than the rule. For donors like Clarissa Marz\u00e1n, an account executive in New York City, giving to advocacy organizations like the ACLU is a way to maximize the impact of her contributions. \"I wanted to donate to organizations that have a diverse mission so that I can still pitch in for other important causes such as immigration rights and LGBTQ rights,\" she said. \"I liked that organizations like the ACLU and Southern Poverty Law Center had that broad reach.\" To approximate that reach, minority-led organizations are banding together to share resources. \"None of our partners are new \u2014 we've talked and worked together for years. But it certainly does feel different in this political climate,\" said Nadia Tonova, director of the National Network for Arab American Communities, whose mission is to develop local nonprofits across the country. In contrast to the ACLU, which raised nearly seven times what it raised during 2015 in the weekend following the executive order, NNAAC donations have risen by only 15 percent since the election. At the state and national level, NNAAC partners with a variety of minority-led groups like South Asian Americans Leading Together and Muslim Advocates, which is a legal and education advocacy group. \"We're talking much more frequently as things are happening. We're sharing news, talking points, and policy analysis to help accelerate our rapid response, so that we can have space for everyone who wants to be engaged,\" Tonova said. Suman Raghunathan, executive director of SAALT, commends large advocacy organizations for supporting their efforts as she works to build a cross-cultural coalition with organizations like United We Dream and the Black Alliance for Just Immigration. Members of Congress, including Rep. Joseph Crowley (second from right), participate in a vigil coordinated and sponsored by SAALT to honor and bring national attention to the victims of hate violence in South Asian, Sikh, Muslim and Arab-American communities across the country.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Members of Congress, including Rep. Joseph Crowley (second from right), participate in a vigil coordinated and sponsored by SAALT to honor and bring national attention to the victims of hate violence in South Asian, Sikh, Muslim and Arab-American communities across the country. Some donors, like Austin Chanu, a music teacher in Los Angeles, support the efforts of these grass-roots groups to expand their community outreach in the aftermath of the election. \"I have donated to larger groups or local political candidates [in the past] but have slowly come to the realization that my money is better being directed toward local grass-roots organizations that are working for racial, economic and social justice,\" Chanu said. \"I found out about BAJI just last month and after reading about its history and roots in Oakland and San Francisco, I knew I had to donate. They are doing important work organizing and educating African-American and black immigrant communities.\" But despite the support of donors like Chanu, some small, minority-led immigrant rights groups express frustration at not being included in the latest national organizing campaigns. On March 11, the ACLU launched PeoplePower.org, a platform to organize mass resistance to renewed threats to civil rights and civil liberties. The program builds on the widespread donations and support the group has received since President Trump's inauguration and controversial executive orders, and it aims to take on the cause of grass-roots organizing nationwide. In response to these critiques, Faiz Shakir, the ACLU's national political director, said the organization is \"coming to the fight and bringing even more resources and personnel to lift up all of the fights that some of these groups are waging on the ground. We want to provide a platform that any grass-roots group could use to reach larger numbers of people.\" Still, one minority group leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, cast a skeptical eye on such initiatives. Although he acknowledges a good working relationship with the ACLU and National Immigration Law Center over the years, he is wary of attempts to expand their grass-roots work. \"It appears to us that we need to order our priorities not only because of what Donald Trump is doing but also due to what groups like the ACLU are doing,\" he said. \"I don't want to be in a competitive space because we have scarce resources, and we need to find the best way to use them.\" To Mijente, a Latino advocacy group in Chicago, the dominance of more \"mainstream\" organizations is nothing new. \"Self-representation has been a central pillar of all successful social change movements, and it's been one that's historically been ignored in the immigrant-rights movement,\" said Tania Unzueta, Mijente's policy and legal director. \"The people we need to be looking to and supporting right now are veteran organizers of red states who have lessons to share from the front lines of Trump's America.\" Organizers from Mijente, Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, Ruckus Society and other activist organizations stage a protest and march outside Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland during the Republican National Convention in July 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Gabriella Demczuk for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption For minority-led groups, close engagement with and awareness of community needs provides an advantage in developing programming. Some organizations, like BAJI, strive for a bottom-up approach through member-led outreach. According to Carl Lipscombe, deputy director, \"We're out there in communities talking to them about their lives, so we have a better sense of the priorities of immigrant families and what they face day to day.\" James Zogby, founder and president of the Arab-American Institute, concedes that groups with resources and expertise to mount complex courtroom cases might be better placed to spearhead legal challenges, but he champions protecting a seat at the table for minority-led groups. \"We challenge people to reflect on the cultural definition of America, who we are as a country, and what we want to be,\" he said. \"I think that's something we can do, and that we are uniquely positioned to do, because of our experience, who we are, and our story.\" Akinyi Ochieng is a writer and researcher studying at the London School of Economics.

Updated at 9 a.m. ET Monday Prime Minister Narendra Modi is calling for a \"New India\" in the wake of his party's unprecedented showing in voting in the country's biggest, most important battleground state. Results from five states electing legislative assemblies were announced over the weekend. Young Indians who want a more prosperous country in their lifetime especially seized on Narendra Modi to deliver it. Headlines declared Modi \"King of the Heartland,\" a reference to his landslide win in the state of Uttar Pradesh, or UP, next door to New Delhi. Modi's party also swept the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. But it is the vast UP with its plains that stretch to Nepal that resonates the loudest. With Modi's personal appeal, his party secured 80 percent of the 403 seats up for grabs in the statehouse. Poor and agricultural, Uttar Pradesh is emblematic of India, suffering power shortages, poor education, and challenged sanitation. All of the country's fault lines run thru the UP \u2014 caste, class, communal divisions. Modi's BJP engineered the victory in part by fielding candidates who spring from \"Other Backward Classes,\" a term used by the Indian government to classify castes that are socially and educationally disadvantaged. The party, with its strong Hindu base, did not draw a single member from the UP's sizeable Muslim community. Modi captured the public imagination, in the words of the Asian Age newspaper, barnstorming the state \"as though the devil was on his heels,\" promising to lift up its 220 million people. Adding to the drama of India's election was the cliffhanger outcome of the country's so-called demonetization. In a political gamble, Modi last year ordered all 500 and 1,000 rupee notes pulled from circulation, a bid to force anyone who held large stashes of unreported wealth to come clean. The order removed most of India's cash from the economy, occasioning a massive money shortage. The election was seen as a referendum on Modi's decision. The efficacy of the exercise is still unclear, but Modi tapped into simmering class anger over corruption on the part of the illicit rich, and voters evidently agreed that a crackdown was in order. Modi had energized voters evoking his own poverty-stricken beginnings. Addressing party workers Sunday night, the prime minister made uplifting the poor the cornerstone of the \"New India,\" as the country approaches its 75th anniversary of independence in 2022. They want the opportunity to work, not collect dole, he said. \"The poor turning out in large numbers for development presents the image of a New India,\" he said. The win in the UP improves the math for Modi's party in the Upper House of Parliament. The members are elected from the state assemblies, and the UP has 31 members in the 245-seat body. With this new mandate, Modi likely will continue to go after financial corruption. He will also be able pursue other reform such as greater tax compliance. Modi's BJP also outflanked the opposition and cobbled enough support from smaller parties to form governments in the western state of Goa and northeastern state of Manipur, which saw the party surge for the first time. The large northern state of Punjab went resoundingly anti-incumbent, handing the state to the opposition Congress Party, run by the dynasty of the Gandhi family. Writing on the BJP's dominance over the opposition, commentator Pratap Bhanu Mehta said, \"Modi has managed to outmanoeuvere them on every faultline. ... He has managed to occupy the pro-poor narrative that parties like the Congress ... thought was their natural territory.\" The sweeping victory in Uttar Pradesh gives Modi an edge on a weakened opposition ahead of the national election in 2019, when he's expected to seek a second term.",

In 2014, 21 percent faced serious charges including murder, rape, kidnapping and arson. Last week, five states in India began going to the polls. One of them, Uttar Pradesh, has a population of some 200 million people. The undertaking is so vast that polling will take place in seven phases, spread out over February and March. India's national elections are an even more complex undertaking, often lasting up to two months from the start of voting till ballots are counted and the results announced. This is done partly to provide adequate security at polling booths, to prevent vote rigging, a practice that was rampant in much of rural \u2013 and sometimes urban \u2013 India for decades. Though it doesn't deal with the issue directly, Milan Vaishnav's new book, When Crime Pays: Money and Muscle in Indian Politics, helps explain why India takes such extraordinary steps to protect its voting processes.

The world's largest democracy, it turns out, has a government full of men \u2013 and occasionally women \u2013 who are steeped in and emerging from the world of crime. What's curious is that the crimes many Indian politicians are accused of are not white-collar crimes like corruption or bribery, but serious offenses like murder, kidnapping, arson, banditry, rapes and more. Yet voters keep electing them and parties keep choosing them as their candidates. In 2014, some 34 percent of India's members of parliament faced criminal cases; 21 percent faced serious ones. Vaishnav, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who specializes in India's political economy, spent years researching and conducting interviews on the ground. His book makes for sober reading. In an email exchange, he helped explain the \"crime-politics nexus\" in Indian politics and why India's case matters not just for other developing countries and nascent democracies, but also to established ones like the United States. There's a certain element of corruption in politics everywhere. But what you highlight in your book is how, in India, politics is attractive to criminals. Why do criminals actually want to run for some of the highest offices in the land? Criminals have been active in Indian politics for decades, dating back to the country's first elections following independence in 1947. Back then, the Congress Party [which led India's struggle for independence] was the center of political gravity and it contracted with criminals to mobilize or suppress turnout, hand out pre-election \"goodies\" or, in some extreme cases, capture polling booths. Money and Muscle in Indian Politics by Milan Vaishnav Hardcover, 410 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Over time, political competition intensified and, as the Congress Party's hegemony began to atrophy, criminals realized that they had accumulated enough clout, notoriety and resources to cut out the politician and contest elections on their own. Criminals sought out politics to ensure their protection \u2014 from the state as well as from their rivals \u2014 and to make even more money by tapping into government contracts, funds, and patronage. Why do political parties in India allow such criminals in their ranks? Why aren't they afraid this will taint the reputation of their parties? Across the world, elections have grown increasingly expensive. [Indian] parties have become so desperate for resources, they actively compete with one another to embrace \"tainted\" politicians who can cover the costs of their own campaigns, pay the parties for the privilege of running and subsidize candidates who don't have the same kind of wealth. Why do voters in India vote for criminals? This, to my mind, is the most perplexing piece of the puzzle. It's one thing for criminals to run for office and parties to welcome them, but why would voters willingly back them? Much to my surprise, most voters I spoke with were not only aware of politicians' criminal backgrounds, but often voted for them precisely for this reason. In an environment where the rule of law is weak \u2014 which means the government cannot carry out its sovereign responsibilities effectively \u2014 and society is deeply divided along ethnic lines, many voters view strongmen as saviors. These politicians tout their willingness and ability to \"do whatever it takes\" to represent their community's interests. They reinforce this message by expressly catering to their narrow segment of the electorate. In a country with a fragmented, multi-party political system, you can often win elections by rallying your core supporters. You write that most voters you spoke to were aware of who they were voting for. I wonder what role illiteracy and poverty \u2013 and by some measures, a third of India's citizens are illiterate or live in extreme poverty \u2013 play in whom they choose as their representatives? Voter ignorance, I found, is not a compelling explanation of voter behavior. For starters, candidates who have outlaw reputations often make a great show of highlighting their criminal reputations. Far from being obscured, they are often worn as a badge of honor. Indian lawmakers Mohammed Shahabuddin (left) and Pappu Yadav were both serving jail sentences when they arrived at India's Parliament for a vote in 2008.\n                \n                    \n                    Manish Swarup/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indian lawmakers Mohammed Shahabuddin (left) and Pappu Yadav were both serving jail sentences when they arrived at India's Parliament for a vote in 2008. Second, voters in poor countries have all kinds of informal mechanisms of getting information outside of established media channels. In addition, literacy has steadily risen in recent years but criminality in politics is arguably gaining ground, not diminishing (judging by the increasing share of state and national politicians with pending criminal cases). Finally, at least one study has tried to rigorously evaluate whether providing voters with information about the criminal characteristics of their politicians affects their behavior. This study, conducted in the slums of Delhi, found that such information had no discernible impact on voter behavior. One possible conclusion is that voters were not being told anything they did not already know. Is this, then, a failure of India's democratic institutions \u2013 the judiciary, the press? In India, universal franchise was extended from the very beginning, in 1947. Over time, the core institutions of governance \u2014 the civil service, police, courts, and so on \u2014 have simply not been able to keep up with the aspirations of 1.3 billion Indians. This governance gap, further compounded by the innumerable social cleavages that exist in society, has created a vacuum for savvy political entrepreneurs to fill. This is, although it seems perverse, democracy in action. How can India combat this? India has the smallest police-per-capita ratio of any major country in the world. Fully one-third of judicial postings lie vacant. The ability of state and local governments to impartially deliver basic welfare services is extremely limited. As long as these infirmities exist, so will criminal politicians. Because building up the state is a long, slow task ... there are some short-term measures reformers can take, such as cleaning up how politics are funded. But to fully resolve the challenges of this unique nexus, one has to address both the supply of criminal politicians as well as the demand for them. Is India unique in the systematic way in which criminals appear to have entered politics? There are several other countries where we see the symbiosis of crime and politics. In a diverse set of countries such as Brazil, Jamaica, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines, similar dynamics are at play. And this is not purely a developing world phenomenon; after all, many voters in the United States have spoken to reporters about how President Trump's demonstrated ability to bend the rules in his business career spoke to his qualifications to do whatever it took to get a \"good deal\" for ordinary Americans. However, India is unique for at least two reasons. First, the scale of the issue is mind-boggling. And second, many politicians \u2014 at least 20 percent of Parliament \u2014 are accused of serious violations of the law. This speaks to the real weakness of the rule of law in India, which both creates an opportunity for the criminal politician to act as a \"Robin Hood\" figure, and increases the likelihood that he or she can manipulate the rules once in office, with a low probability of being punished.

Tom and Dick Smothers came to CBS in 1967 not really intending to lead or support a revolution. They just got caught up in it \u2014 and they happened to have a network program, with some 30 million viewers, on which they criticized the war in Vietnam, celebrated rock 'n' roll music and satirized politics and politicians. The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, which premiered 50 years ago this week, got its message out slowly and sometimes sneakily at first. A lot of it came through the music and the hot new acts booked to perform on air. Over the run of the show, it was like a series of anthems from the counterculture \u2014 from Buffalo Springfield singing \"For What It's Worth\" to the Beatles singing \"Revolution\" \u2014 with the American TV debut of The Who, and the West Coast cast of Hair, and Dion singing a song about assassinated heroes in between. The Beatles didn't appear live to sing \"Hey Jude\" and \"Revolution.\" They'd gotten disinterested in touring by 1968, so they made these new things called videos, and gave them to only one TV program in the United States. Not to The Ed Sullivan Show, which had helped launch Beatlemania and the British invasion four years before \u2014 but to the Smothers Brothers. That same year, George Harrison of the Beatles showed up unannounced \u2014 not to sing, but to support Tom and Dick in their fight against the CBS censors. By then, the fights had become almost legendary. Tom confessed to Harrison that on American television, they didn't always get the chance to say what they wanted to say, and Harrison advised, \"Whether you can say it or not, keep trying to say it.\" At first, the censored bits were silly, like an Elaine May sketch about, ironically, censorship. But quickly, the jokes became political, and battle lines were drawn. CBS was like a stern parent, placing more and more restrictions on a rebellious teenager \u2014 and Tom, especially, got more rebellious. He and brother Dick and the rest, including head writer Mason Williams (who unveiled his hit instrumental \"Classical Gas\" on the show), put more meat and meaning into the program \u2014 or tried to. A skit poking fun at LBJ got the president to call CBS Chairman William Paley in the middle of the night to complain \u2014 which, in turn, led to Paley asking the show to ease up on its presidential satire. In return, Paley agreed to break the 17-year blacklist on folksinger Pete Seeger, who appeared in 1967 to sing, as part of an anti-war medley, a new song he'd written called \"Waist Deep in the Big Muddy,\" an obvious allegory about the Vietnam War and Johnson himself. CBS cut the song, Tom went to the press to complain \u2014 and the following year, in a triumphant performance, Seeger was asked back. It was during this appearance that he was allowed to sing his song about soldiers trying to ford an unexpectedly deep river. Other segments produced for the show never saw the light of day \u2014 or, at least, the prime time of night. For its first show after the violence-filled 1968 Democratic National Convention, Comedy Hour had Harry Belafonte sing a medley of calypso songs, with reworked lyrics to reflect the disarray and dissent in America \u2014 while news footage of police brutality and student protests was projected behind him. That never made it to air. Nor did a comic sermonette by comedian David Steinberg, whose mortal sin, to CBS, was making fun of religion at all. His first sermon got more negative mail than anything in the history of TV up to that point. When Tom asked him back, CBS ordered there be no sermon. Steinberg delivered one anyway \u2014 about Jonah and the whale. Not only was that sketch cut, but the entire show was pulled from the air \u2014 and shortly thereafter, the Smothers Brothers were fired. They took CBS to court for breach of contract and eventually won a settlement close to $1 million, but they lost their platform. The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour influenced all satirical political shows that followed, from Saturday Night Live to Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver and Samantha Bee. Comedy Hour also contributed one of the best political satires ever \u2014 a literal running gag in which series regular Pat Paulsen ran for the presidency. The Comedy Hour lasted into the early months of the Nixon administration, which were prefaced by the brothers' on-air promise, in a tongue-in-cheek manner, to \"lay off the jokes\" toward the president-elect ... at least for a while. On their final show, Dick read a letter he and Tom had gotten from former President Johnson. These days, President Trump responds to Saturday Night Live skits with angry tweets. Back then, Johnson, reflecting on his treatment by the Smothers Brothers, responded by writing: \"It is part of the price of leadership of this great and free nation to be the target of clever satirists. You have given the gift of laughter to our people. May we never grow so somber or self-important that we fail to appreciate the humor in our lives.\" Happy anniversary, Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, and thanks for everything. ",

            "article_content": "by Simon Tolkien Hardcover, 578 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? I would argue that the most successful novel of the First World War is not A Farewell to Arms, or even All Quiet on the Western Front, but rather one that's rarely classified so: The Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien. Like several other British veterans of the trenches \u2014 CS Lewis and David Lindsay come to mind \u2014 Tolkien chose to explore the inhuman horrors of the Great War through the allegory of mythology. In fiction, poetry, or memoir, he never explicitly addressed his time on the Somme. And neither does a new novel by his grandson, no matter the \"inspired by the real-life experiences\" copy on the dust jacket. Simon Tolkien dedicates No Man's Land to his grandfather, inviting the question: Is this the book that J.R.R. was unable to write? In style, theme, and tone, the answer is no. But who can blame Simon for not even trying to put words in the mouth of his legendary relative? Our protagonist is Adam Raine, no stand-in for J.R.R. except in the most basic ways. Raine grows up on the streets of London, moves to coal country in northern England, and then is taken in by the landed lord of the manor. His story is one of serial strife \u2014 the picket lines, union strikes, mining accidents, grinding want, and Downton Abbey politics of early 20th century Britain \u2014 even before he enters the war. \"Luck ain't a word we knows the meanin' of,\" says a working class friend. This is not a war book, then, but rather David Copperfield Goes to War. Only in its central third does this novel of manners and civil discord do an about face and march directly to the front lines in France. The shift is sudden, as if the book, like British society, didn't believe the war would really come until it did. This is not a war book ... but rather David Copperfield Goes to War. Brian Castner Simon Tolkien is at his best capturing the jingoism of early-wartime England, the smothering sense of duty and obligation heaped on young men, the peer pressure and public calls of cowardice, old women in the streets lecturing able-bodied boys to get to the front. It is a sentiment completely foreign to contemporary American culture \u2014 now, we deem not enlisting the smart choice, like Donald Trump (as he declared in an election debate) is smart not to pay his taxes. But Raine and every one of his friends eventually sign up, if only because \"anythin's better than that bloody mine,\" as one says. Raine's victimhood shifts, from class and poverty to idiot generals and the guns; trapped in the system, one tragedy after another befalls him. Raine finds the Great War by turns grisly and romantic. The soldiers on corpse-recovery duty vomit in their gas masks because the flies, \"clustered so thickly on the rotting flesh that they looked like black fur, were so drunk from feasting that they crawled rather than flew away, leaving their white maggot progeny behind.\" And yet, at the same time, he sees his fellow soldiers \"go over the top again and again, inspiring their men with a nonchalant bravery that left him open-mouthed with admiration.\" There is truth in this duality, no matter how out-of-step it feels today, knowing how two world wars will turn out. In the book's last third, coincidence and clich\u00e9 play an unfortunately large role. But such quibbles miss the point. This is a page-turner, an opera, a costume drama to binge watch. Simon Tolkien knows how to keep a story moving, and he does it well. Brian Castner's newest project is The Road Ahead,\"a co-edited anthology of short stories featuring veteran writers.",

The six faith leaders President-elect Donald Trump has invited to pray at his inauguration come from diverse backgrounds, but they have something in common: All have personal ties to Trump or his family or have in some way signaled their approval of him, his politics or his wealth. The group includes an African-American megachurch leader from Detroit, a Florida woman known for her lavish lifestyle and preaching on \"abundancy,\" a rabbi from Los Angeles, and a Hispanic evangelical \u2014 as well as Franklin Graham (son of Billy Graham) and Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York. Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, who leads Great Faith Ministries in Detroit, played a key role during the presidential campaign by inviting candidate Trump to visit his church. For Trump, it was a rare appearance before a black congregation. Presenting Trump with a Jewish prayer shawl during his visit, Jackson said, \"There are going to be times in your life that you are going to feel forsaken ... but the anointing is going to lift you up.\" With his invitation to Jackson to pray at his inauguration, Trump returned a favor. Jackson lives in a multimillion-dollar mansion in Detroit and drives luxury cars. He preaches that being rich is not bad and that Trump's wealth shows he is \"blessed by God.\" Such teachings exemplify the \"prosperity gospel,\" which holds that God rewards faithful Christians with financial success. It is a faith tradition with which Trump long has been associated. His \"spiritual adviser\" is Paula White, who as the leader of New Destiny Christian Center near Orlando, Fla., is perhaps the best known prosperity preacher in the country. \"Every day you're [living] your destiny, designed by God and discovered by you,\" White said in a recent sermon. \"You're either in a position of abundance, you're in a position of prosperity, or you're in a position of poverty. Now that's in every area of your life. ... You're living abundant in your affairs of life \u2014 and that includes your financial conditions \u2014 or you're living in poverty.\" Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is drawn to those preachers who say that one's wealth is a sign of God's approval. Paula White has her critics in the evangelical world, some of whom consider her a heretic, but she endorsed Trump's candidacy, and he reciprocated by inviting White to pray at his swearing-in ceremony. Another pro-Trump evangelist who will be praying at the inauguration is Franklin Graham. During a recent interview with Lou Dobbs on the Fox Business Network, Graham said \"the hand of God\" was evident in Trump's election. Evangelist Franklin Graham will follow his family's tradition of praying at presidential inaugurations when he prays during the ceremony for President-elect Donald Trump. He prayed previously at the 2001 inauguration of George W. Bush, and Graham's father, Billy, prayed at the inauguration of several presidents.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Evangelist Franklin Graham will follow his family's tradition of praying at presidential inaugurations when he prays during the ceremony for President-elect Donald Trump. He prayed previously at the 2001 inauguration of George W. Bush, and Graham's father, Billy, prayed at the inauguration of several presidents. \"I think God intervened and put his hand on Donald Trump for some reason,\" Graham told Dobbs. \"It's obvious that there was something behind this, and it was more than people understand. I just think it was God.\" By appearing at Trump's swearing-in, Franklin Graham will be following family tradition: His 98-year-old father, Billy, prayed at the inauguration of several presidents, from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton, and Franklin prayed at the inauguration of George W. Bush in 2001. His inclusion as a prayer leader may also signal Trump's comfort with Graham's political positions. During his campaign, Trump focused a lot of attention on the threat from \"radical Islam,\" a theme Franklin Graham also has emphasized. Shared political views may also explain Trump's invitation to Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founding president of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. In a recent television interview, Hier said it was \"outrageous\" that the Obama administration chose not to veto a recent United Nations resolution condemning Israel's settlement policy, echoing Trump's own criticism. Hier, the first rabbi asked to pray at a presidential inauguration since 1985, says he will hit \"modern themes\" during his inauguration appearance. \"It will be a short prayer, but it will reflect on the 21st century,\" he says. Hier also has ties to the Trump world through Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and close adviser. Kushner's parents are old friends with Hier and his wife. One indication of Trump's unorthodox approach in choosing inauguration prayer leaders is the absence of any representative of mainline Protestantism, the dominant faith tradition of U.S. presidents throughout the country's history. On the other hand, Trump is the first to invite a Hispanic evangelical leader, the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference and senior pastor at New Season Christian Worship Center, an Assemblies of God congregation in Sacramento, Calif. Rodriguez accepted the invitation despite some misgivings about Trump's hard-line immigration views. \"There was a bit of angst due to the fact that throughout the course of this campaign, the rhetoric and tone, as it pertained particularly to the immigrant community, did not line up with the ethos or the values of the NHCLC,\" Rodriguez told NPR. He agreed to come to Washington for the inauguration after \"prayerful deliberation and discussion\" and a conclusion that he could not pass up an opportunity to pray on \"the quintessential political platform on the planet.\" Among Hispanic evangelicals, Rodriguez is one of the more conservative leaders. While he did not endorse Trump, he told NPR that he has heard a \"change of tone\" from Trump in the past few weeks, and now has high hopes for better relations between Hispanics and the Trump administration. \"Thirty percent of Latinos voted for Donald Trump,\" Rodriguez points out. \"There's a great possibility that the president-elect and his team have come to the realization that this constituency could be engaged successfully.\" Generally, Trump's selection of inauguration prayer leaders reflects his tendency to break with mainstream thinking \u2014 and the importance he places on loyalty. With his invitations, he has rewarded clergy members who support him politically, endorse his views, or even offer a religious approval of his great wealth. The least surprising prayer leader choice is Cardinal Dolan. Most U.S. presidents in recent years have asked a prominent Catholic bishop or theologian to pray at their inaugurations, and as fellow New Yorkers, Dolan and Trump have known each other for a long time.",

King Jr. at NPR headquarters in Washington. King has worked to protect kids, especially those who have been traditionally marginalized \u2014 children of color, English language learners, students with disabilities and those living in poverty. He didn't have long. Education Secretary John B. King Jr. was confirmed by the Senate in March 2016 after President Obama's long-serving secretary, Arne Duncan, stepped down at the end of 2015. No matter the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, King knew that Obama would be out in a year and replaced by a president who, regardless of party, would almost certainly replace him. At the helm of the Education Department, King followed the polestar that had guided him as a teacher, principal and as deputy secretary under Duncan: protect kids, especially those who have been traditionally marginalized \u2014 children of color, English language learners, students with disabilities and those living in poverty. King knows all too well what it means to live on the margins. Raised in Brooklyn, he lost both of his parents by the age of 12 and found the stability he needed not at home, shuttling between family members, but at school. He credits several public school teachers with saving his life. In writing rules for the new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, King fought to include protections that would prevent districts from spending more money in low-poverty schools than in their neediest classrooms. The move infuriated Republicans in Congress, who accused King of overreach, and vexed teachers unions. King has also used his bully pulpit to urge schools toward greater racial and socio-economic integration. With two weeks left as secretary, King sat down for an exit interview in his Maryland Avenue office overlooking the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. What follows is an edited transcript: What was your best day in the job? I think about a session I did with former Secretary Duncan a few weeks ago, with young men he's working with in Chicago who have been involved in the criminal justice system and are trying to get their lives back on track, and he's working to help them. It was a powerful moment, both because of the difference that mentors are making in their lives and also just talking with them about my own experience. It's just clear to me: There but for the grace of God go I. You know, a small number of differences in experiences for me, and I would have been dealing with the same struggles that they are. I was fortunate that I had teachers and mentors who kept my life on the right path after I lost my parents, and these young men didn't have those mentors and teachers at the right moment. But now they do have folks who are intervening in their lives. Seeing that was a reminder of the urgency of our work. Schools and educational opportunities can save lives. You've talked a lot about your biography while in office. Given that Donald Trump's pick to succeed you, Betsy DeVos, is a billionaire who has never attended public schools, do you think biography matters when it comes to running the Education Department? What matters is beliefs and actions. For me, it is true, that my biography \u2014 my experiences in school, as a teacher, as a principal \u2014 shape my beliefs and how I approach the job. But you can arrive at similar beliefs and actions from different experiences. I think, fundamentally, regardless of party, anyone in the job of secretary needs to be focused on two things. One: The department is a civil rights agency with a responsibility to protect the civil rights of students and to ensure that school is a safe and supportive place for all kids. Biography can inform how you come to that conversation but, at the end of the day, there's a responsibility to protect students' civil rights. Second is that education is fundamental to the long-term success of our economy and our democracy. We need a strong public education system in early childhood. We need a strong K-12 public education system, and we need a strong public higher education system as well. Again, that's not about party or partisanship. That's just fundamental to the work of the department. You've been a champion of diversity in schools, encouraging districts toward racial and socio-economic integration. But, after a presidential election in which race and class became dividing lines, do you worry that much of the country isn't with you and doesn't want to hear the argument? I think Americans value diversity and the promise of equality of opportunity. I do worry that we haven't gotten as far as I would have hoped on the work of school diversity, particularly when you think about it in the broader sweep of American history. It's more than 60 years past Brown v. Board of Education, and we've got communities around the country that are actually more segregated today than they were 10 or 20 years ago by race and by class. I think we'd be in a better place as a country, we'd have a better dialogue, if students had the opportunity to go to school with diverse student populations and to have diverse educators in the classroom. And the research evidence bears that out. Students not only do better academically, but they are better prepared to succeed in a diverse world if they've had those diverse school experiences. I'm optimistic that, as a country, there is a realization that the success of our public education system is so central to our long-term future that we cannot afford to slide backwards. We achieved a high school graduation rate of 83 percent because we've seen significant reductions in the dropout rates for African-American and Latino students. We can't go back from that. And we've got 10 percent of our students around the country who are English language learners. Our success as a country depends on those students having excellent educational opportunities. We can't go backwards on that. Both Trump and DeVos have been supporters of school vouchers and of letting federal Title I dollars follow low-income students wherever they choose to go, even if it's to private, religious schools. How do you feel about that? Vouchers are not a scalable solution to the challenges we face in American education. In many places, I think, the conversation about vouchers is driven by a legitimate concern about how we ensure equality of opportunity. I think the way we do that is through strong public schools. District schools, traditional schools, and charter schools. And part of how we ensure schools are good is we have meaningful systems of accountability that focus people on outcomes for kids. I worry that, in some states, whether it's vouchers or charters, where there aren't good accountability systems in place, you have a proliferation of low-performing schools, and you don't have the outcomes for kids that are, at least in theory, the rationale for the policy. So our support for charters is grounded in the notion that, yes, we can have an innovative charter sector that develops new strategies, new approaches that can be shared with traditional district schools. But that only happens when you have a strong charter law \u2014 you have high standards for who gets a charter and meaningful accountability. You look at a state like Massachusetts, they have that. Boston has some of the highest-performing charters in the country. States like New York, they have that. New York City has some of the highest-performing charters in the country. Unfortunately, other states like Michigan have weak systems of accountability, and that's a problem. And the result is a proliferation of low-performing schools. Is there a voucher plan that you could support? No. Honestly, I don't think vouchers get at the real challenges that we have. You know, I understand folks' concern about ensuring opportunity for the kids in our highest-needs communities, but the way we should do that is to have strong, high-quality early childhood education, K-12 schools that are providing a rich, well-rounded education that includes not just English and math but science, social studies and the arts, opportunities to take advanced coursework in high school, and then to have strong supports so that students can make the transition from high school into post-secondary opportunities. That, to me, is the answer. I was in a school yesterday where all of the students receive free or reduced-price lunch and roughly two-thirds are below grade-level in reading and math. I asked a couple of the teachers if they had a question they'd like me to put to you. Without missing a beat, the English language-arts teacher said, 'You ask him why it is I'm still giving my kids standardized tests, when kids don't come standardized.' I think, at the end of the day, assessments are one tool among many that we have to get a sense of whether students are making progress. We've been very clear, we don't think you should judge the performance of a student, teacher or a school just based on a single test score. But it is useful to know how students are doing in reading and math and science and writing, and it's important for us as a country to know whether or not we're making progress. It's important for this country \u2014 for states and districts \u2014 to know where there are achievement gaps so they can intervene, where schools are struggling so they can provide support. But I imagine that question is driven in part by a sense of frustration that so much attention was placed on one single indicator. And I think the Every Student Succeeds Act gives us an opportunity to look at multiple indicators, things like chronic absenteeism, so that we can identify early if a kid is missing a lot of school, what's going on behind that. Again, I think it's important that we know how schools are doing. That's how we call attention to these gaps that we see. At the same time, she's right. There's a saying that the pig doesn't get fatter from weighing it. And that's true. We think it's important to have an annual indicator of progress that students are making. For parents that's important. For teachers that's important. For school districts, for the country. At the same time, doing that more than once a year isn't going to tell us more. What's the single most important piece of advice you could share with your successor? I don't know if I can do one. I'd say two. One is to protect kids. Kids need to feel safe and supported in school. For some kids, kids like me, school may be the only place that is consistent, supportive and safe in their lives. The second is to listen \u2014 to students, teachers, parents and communities \u2014 and try to understand the challenges they are facing and how we can help. What's next for you? I don't know yet. I'm very focused on the stuff we need to get done. We still have things on our list. We're going to be working hard all the way up until the last moment. And then I'll take some time with family and decide what's next. But whatever I do will be focused on the kids who are most vulnerable, kids for whom school is the difference \u2014 like it was for me.",

            "article_content": "Brazil's former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has been convicted of corruption charges. Lula, as he's popularly known, was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison but remains free pending appeal. Lula denies wrongdoing and claims the charges are politically motivated.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been convicted of corruption. He's been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison. Right now he's free pending appeal. Lula denies that he has done anything wrong. He claims the charges are politically motivated. The case is part of a sprawling corruption investigation involving Brazil's elite. NPR's Philip Reeves is on the line from Rio de Janeiro. Hi, Phil. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Hi. SHAPIRO: What's the reaction there to Lula's conviction? REEVES: Very divided, actually. Lula's opponents are delighted, of course, and they've been saying so in large numbers on social media. But Lula still enjoys very significant support here. He's been a giant on the political scenes for decades. And when he left office at the end of 2010, his popularity rating was over 80 percent. He was president at a prosperous time. And his supporters tend to revere him as this kind of working-class leader, charismatic guy who came out of poverty through the trade union movement and who, when he finally won office, pulled millions of Brazilians out of poverty and raised Brazil's international profile by securing the soccer World Cup and the Olympics. So if this conviction actually marks Lula's departure from the political scene, it will leave a huge gap on the political stage, especially on the left. SHAPIRO: And it comes as he was making a political comeback with an eye toward possibly running again in next year's presidential election. How does this conviction affect that plan? REEVES: Yeah, in fact, his lawyers and his political party portray this case as a witch hunt to prevent him from running for the presidency again. He's seen as the front-runner right now. And at the moment, he can still run. But if his conviction's upheld on appeal, then he would be barred from office. And since he's 71 years old, it would be game over for him politically. This particular conviction is for accepting kickbacks worth a little over a million dollars from an engineering company, money that he's accused of using to refurbish an apartment by the beach. But let's not forget that Lula's facing other trials for graft. And so even if he wins the appeal, the former president's troubles will be far from over. SHAPIRO: And as we said, this is part of a much larger corruption investigation. Brazil's current president is in trouble. Bring us up to date on that case. REEVES: Indeed, Michel Temer is trying very hard to avoid the same fate as Lula. He's been fighting for his political life for weeks, actually, ever since a secret recording emerged of him apparently endorsing hush-money payments. He's now been charged by Brazil's attorney general with corruption. And the matter's in the hands of Congress. And if the lower house - the lower house is going to vote soon over whether to go ahead with the indictment. And if two-thirds approve, then Temer would be suspended for 180 days and the presidential - the president's job would be assumed by the speaker temporarily. And the case would go to the Supreme Court. We don't know whether Temer can survive this scandal. His support would be wafer thin and getting thinner. SHAPIRO: Back to Lula for just a moment. As you've said, he plans to appeal. What happens? How long will that take? REEVES: We don't know for sure. I mean, there seems to be a consensus here that the wheels of the - of justice move slowly and that an appeal could take months and perhaps many months. This case is all part of what's known as the Car Wash investigation. It's been going on for three years now. Lula was convicted by Sergio Moro, the federal judge who's almost as famous as he is for leading these prosecutions that have engulfed a huge section of this country's political elite, the top politicians and business executives, and dispatched dozens of them to jail. So Brazilians who've been watching this, I think, with amazement and disgust have grown used to cases dragging on and being somewhat unpredictable. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Philip Reeves speaking with us from Rio de Janeiro. Thanks, Phil. REEVES: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "Law enforcement officials have named James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Ill., as the gunman in Wednesday morning's shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Va.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: We're following the story of this morning's shooting at a baseball field in Alexandria, Va., where several Republican congressmen and their staff members were practicing for a charity game. A gunman with an automatic rifle opened fire there. Congressman Steve Scalise was shot in the hip. He's the House majority whip. He's now reported to be in critical condition after surgery. Two special agents with the Capitol Police were also wounded as well as a congressional staffer and a lobbyist. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The gunman died in an exchange of fire with Capitol Police and Alexandria police on the scene. He's been identified as James Hodgkinson of Belleville, Ill. He was 66 years old, a retired home inspector with a long record of political activism around liberal causes. NPR's Tom Gjelten has been looking into Hodgkinson's background and is in the studio with us now. Hi, Tom. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: What more have you been able to gather about him? GJELTEN: Actually quite a bit. He had a fairly significant public profile mostly because of his political views, a long record of writing letters to his local newspaper, a long record of contacting his local congressmen with his complaints. He was a supporter of Bernie Sanders in the last election campaign. Belleville there is a white, working-class community. He had, as you say, a home inspection business there. Local reporters spoke to someone who grew up with him, Dale Walsh, and he remembered Hodgkinson as a kind of a feisty guy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DALE WALSH: Through the years, he didn't back down. So I mean he was in a few fights and stuff like that but nothing that would demonstrate violence. SHAPIRO: Do we know how he ended up in the D.C. area, Alexandria, Va., this morning? GJELTEN: The FBI think he'd been here since March. He apparently drove out from Illinois and was living out of his car. A former mayor of Alexandria says he saw Hodgkinson every morning at the YMCA right next to the field where the shooting took place. He was, in the mayor's words, living out of his gym bag. We also spoke to a librarian in Alexandria who says Hodgkinson was a regular there, coming in to look at reading materials, much of them having to do with politics. We don't know why he came here. Although it's clear he was obsessed with Republican politicians. SHAPIRO: Was there anything to indicate that he was violent? GJELTEN: There was one incident in 2006 where he and his wife were both arrested and charged with assaulting a neighbor. It was a dispute over the custody of their foster daughter. He did have a weapon at that point. He didn't fire it. But the police report did indicate he had a weapon. He was a gun owner. And we know that he was actually target shooting in his yard recently. Just two days ago, he posted a very angry tweet about the president. You know, one question, Ari, is his mental and physical condition. St. Louis Public Radio today spoke to the political director of the Sanders campaign in Missouri, Adam Kustra, who recalled that Hodgkinson was not in great physical shape. ADAM KUSTRA: I have recollections of him being very sick and immobile. GJELTEN: And we should keep in mind that he died in an exchange of gunfire with police, which would've suggested he was essentially suicidal when it came to the end. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Tom Gjelten on what we know about the shooter in this morning's incident. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In Pakistan, a corruption scandal could bring down a rising political star, Maryam Sharif, the prime minister's daughter.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: In Pakistan, a corruption scandal is threatening to bring down the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif. It could also end the political career of his media-savvy daughter, Maryam Sharif. She has pushed to improve the lives of women there. Many Pakistanis expect her to take over from her father, which is why some are cheering for her downfall. NPR's Diaa Hadid reports from Islamabad. DIAA HADID, BYLINE: I'm standing outside Pakistan's Supreme Court. This normally staid place is the scene of Pakistan's biggest drama right now. Blue-clad police line the roads, and about two dozen journalists are crammed as close as they can to the entryway. You can hear the whir of their satellite trucks in the background as they broadcast live because it's in this building where the fate of the prime minister will be decided. AMBER SHAMSI: Offshore company, tax evasion, money laundering, prime minister's children - dun-dun (ph), headlines. HADID: That's Amber Shamsi. She's a TV presenter with Dawn, the leading English news group. Long-standing questions about the finances of the family of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif were triggered after revelations in the Panama Papers. They showed Sharif's children linked to expensive apartments in London. The scandal is particularly embarrassing for his daughter Maryam. During the court investigation, Maryam submitted papers showing she was the trustee of one of those apartments, not the owner. The document from 2006 was written in Calibri, the default Microsoft Word font. SHAMSI: The font that this document was written in was not available before - for public use or general use before 2006, but it was widely available after 2007. And bam, that's when font gate happened. HADID: A court-appointed investigation committee concluded that... SHAMSI: Maryam had lied to the court, falsified documents. And this is a criminal offense. And this could possibly mean jail. HADID: But for some in Pakistan, Maryam is a breath of fresh air in contrast to the staid male politicians around her. She not only whipped up crowds campaigning for her father in the last elections... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Maryam Nawaz Sharif (foreign language spoken). HADID: ...But also tweets to her 3.5 million followers regularly as well. And once her father became prime minister... SHAMSI: She was very, very active behind getting an anti-honor killing bill passed in the major main house of Parliament. Much of the pro-women's legislation has been attributed to Maryam Nawaz as well. HADID: Ammara Durrani, a political analyst, says now many are cheering for the downfall of the prime minister's daughter. She's become shorthand for a tradition in Pakistan of dynastic politics, which they say has stunted democracy here. AMMARA DURRANI: The reason why Maryam Sharif has received so much single-minded opposition from her detractors is because she was seen to have emerged as the most likely successor for Nawaz Sharif in the upcoming elections. HADID: But in a working-class market, some have a different view. Her father is popular among Pakistan's poor because he's seen as repairing roads and fixing the shoddy power. Consider Johnston Bashir, who sells rat poison in this market. He likes the red public buses that recently began running in Islamabad. JOHNSTON BASHIR: (Foreign language spoken). HADID: They're air conditioned and cost about two cents a ride. And if Maryam Sharif can convince people that she'll continue that agenda, she may yet survive despite the scandal.

            "article_content": "Doug Jones is the first Democrat to win a Senate election in Alabama in a quarter century. Although he wasn't a household name in the state before the campaign began, Jones has a long history in state politics.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Republican Roy Moore still refuses to concede yesterday's race in Alabama to Democrat Doug Jones. The state's election chief said today that ballots that are still uncounted will not likely end up changing the result. Jones pulled off a stunning upset, becoming the first Democrat the state is sending to the U.S. Senate in 25 years. In a news conference today, Jones said he received a call from President Trump congratulating him on his win and inviting him to the White House. He also outlined his vision going forward. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) DOUG JONES: I think that this election shows that people across this country want to see people work together. When the people of Alabama elect a senator who runs on a platform of trying to find common ground and reaching across aisles, I think that's a message that both political parties should take heed. SIEGEL: NPR's Debbie Elliott joins us from Montgomery. And Debbie, this is Jones' first elected position. What can you tell us about him? DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Well, it's the first time he's run for public office, but he's no stranger to politics. He's been active in Democratic Party circles for some time. He's a former federal prosecutor appointed by President Bill Clinton. He's best known for reopening the 1963 Ku Klux Klan bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham where four black girls were killed. Here's Jones after he won a murder conviction in that case in 2001. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JONES: We believe that this is the correct verdict. It's late. They say that, you know, justice delayed is justice denied. Well, folks, I don't believe that for an instant. Justice delayed is still justice, and we've got it right here in Birmingham tonight. ELLIOTT: Now he's talking again about the arc of justice, quoting Martin Luther King Jr. SIEGEL: Well, what can we glean from Doug Jones' campaign and his record that would tell us what kind of senator he might be? ELLIOTT: Well, the crux of his campaign was really that he would be a counter to the bitter partisan divide that we've been seeing in Washington. He has served there briefly at a time when Southern Democrats held great power. Jones, when he got out of law school, went to work for then-Alabama Democratic Senator Howell Heflin, whom he considered a mentor. Today he's close with former Vice President Joe Biden. But he keeps saying he's not going to be a party man. Here's the speech that he made last summer to Alabama's county commissioners. This was before the Republicans had even picked their nominee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JONES: I am my own man, and I intend to be an independent voice for Alabama not really encumbered by allegiances to a president or even a party leader but someone who wants to build bridges. ELLIOTT: You know, he talks a lot about bridging divides, whether they be racial, political or economic. And it comes from his background. He comes from a working-class background, a family of steelworkers and coal miners. The kind of issues that he talks about are raising the minimum wage, equal pay for equal work, funding the Children's Health Insurance Program. But he also tapped some of the positions that might bring some moderate Republicans into his fold, things like gun rights and working for a strong military. SIEGEL: Let's talk a moment about Roy Moore, the Republican candidate who has yet to concede. What's next for him? Is this the end of Roy Moore's political career? ELLIOTT: Well, it's hard to recover from the kind of allegations that he faced. But this is Roy Moore. He's used setbacks in his career as a platform to both raise money and gain support often out of Alabama in Christian conservative circles around the nation. I spoke with his brother Jerry Moore last night, and here's how he sees this thing playing out. JERRY MOORE: If he don't win, it's God's will for him not to win. But I can tell you this. I've known him. We've grown up together one year apart. And I'm just going to tell you right now. Every time it looked like the door closed on him, a greater door opened. ELLIOTT: So the question is, what door now? Alabama has a governor's race next year, and the Senate seat is up again in 2020. SIEGEL: NPR's Debbie Elliott - Debbie, thanks. ELLIOTT: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "President Trump has promised to stand up for the forgotten working class.  The administration claims the tax overhaul backs up the promise. Do details of the tax package back up that claim?  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Despite the ups and downs, it does look like President Trump will soon sign his first big piece of legislation on taxes. As we just heard, the Senate and the House are trying to reconcile their versions of the legislation. And that bill marks the next chapter in our understanding of President Trump's governing philosophy. Here's NPR's Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Once upon a time, there was a group of conservative intellectuals who were agnostic about Donald Trump. They weren't never-Trumpers, and they weren't Trump superfans either. They thought Trumpism might offer something new for the GOP, a more populist path toward the future. Conservative writer Henry Olsen looked to the tax plan to reflect this new vision. But it wasn't there. HENRY OLSEN: Trumpian populism has not materialized. It is something that remains a tantalizing promise for people who are interested in it. LIASSON: Olsen expected the tax plan to include some of Trump's populist campaign promises that the rich would pay more, the forgotten working class would pay less and special interest loopholes like the carried interest provision for hedge fund managers would be gone. But the tax bill, says Olsen, went in a different direction. OLSEN: One that is much more traditionally Republican in its focus on cutting taxes for the well-to-do, barely touching the working class and not helping the middle class to a significant degree. And that's not what Trump promised, and it's not what Trump's voters thought they were getting. LIASSON: One of Olsen's biggest disappointments was the failure of the child care tax credit. Offered by Senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubio, it was an actual populist idea geared to the working class, refundable against payroll taxes. But not only did the Republican leadership oppose it. They made sure it failed by requiring it to get 60 votes unlike other amendments. The tax bill may not be the kind of populist piece of legislation Trump promised during the campaign, but it does have a lot in it to make conservatives happy - Obamacare unraveled, more tax breaks for people who send their kids to private schools and tax hikes for graduate students, university endowments and voters in high-tax states - in other words, Democrats. Conservative Joy Pullmann, managing editor of thefederalist.com, wasn't sure what to make of Trump's governing philosophy at first. Now she describes it this way. JOY PULLMANN: It seems to me to be actually pretty classic fusion conservatism. By fusion, I mean the combination of the libertarian and the conservative but with a pair of overalls on (laughter) or maybe a red trucker hat. LIASSON: The red trucker hat suggests another way of looking at Trumpism. Maybe the most important part of Trump isn't economic policy or any policy at all. It's his racially charged Twitter feed and the cultural grievances it directs at immigrants, Muslims and millionaire black athletes, says conservative analyst Ben Domenech. BEN DOMENECH: Having fewer brackets - that may sound fine to voters, but what gets them riled up and active is this type of embrace of the culture war issues that Trump has shown himself perfectly happy to fight in a way that Republicans in a lot of other positions have been unwilling to traditionally. LIASSON: There have always been two parts to the Republican Party's message - conservative social issues for its white, blue-collar evangelical base - school prayer, abortion, gay marriage, immigration, crime - and a supply side trickle-down economic message for the rich and corporations. Trump took this two-pronged message and put it on steroids. His tax bill is even more tilted to the wealthy than the tax bills of Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush, and his white identity politics is more raw and more central to his persona. Olsen doesn't think this Trumpist combination offers a viable path for the GOP, and he's not even sure it's sustainable for Trump. OLSEN: There is a lingering discontent in the country that is much more than racial resentment. What we find in politics is that people will give their choice a long leash. But if the person doesn't deliver on what they really want in the end, they'll turn against them. And if there's still no jobs back and they see a president who offers them bread and circuses through tweets but nothing substantial to help their lives and their community, I think you'll find something different. LIASSON: In the end, voters may turn against the tax bill but probably not right away. In the short term, says Ben Domenech, the tax bill might be just the kind of win Trump and his party need. DOMENECH: I think the truth is that this is a tax bill that if it does have a significant impact for most people, it will be a positive one. And their taxes will actually go down, or they'll be able to keep more of their own money. LIASSON: That's because the tax bill is front-loaded. The goodies come first. The regressive, non-populist part of the bill where taxes for the middle class actually go up - that kicks in later, well after the next election cycle. Mara Liasson, NPR News, the White House.

Members of both parties are wondering what that race and other recent success for Democrats will mean for the 2018 midterms.\n                \n                    \n                    Cliff Owen/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Ralph Northam celebrates his election as governor of Virginia on Nov. 7. Members of both parties are wondering what that race and other recent success for Democrats will mean for the 2018 midterms. Democrats' success in this month's elections was bigger than expected, and was fueled in part by strong opposition to President Trump. In the past few weeks, there's been a lot of chatter about whether that means a big, blue wave is forming off the political coast that could potentially crash into the 2018 midterm elections. We asked Republicans and Democrats what the off-year elections could mean for their parties next year. Here are five takeaways. 1. Good news for Democrats Democrats were girding for a narrow loss in Virginia's gubernatorial election and had already begun to assemble their favorite formation \u2014 the circular firing squad. But that wasn't necessary. The Democratic base was energized. The 2008 Obama coalition of millennials, minorities, single women and affluent educated suburbanites showed up at the polls, something that hadn't happened in 2010 or 2014. Democrats have been battling a kind of off-year election curse \u2014 they get their voters out in presidential years, but can't convince them to turn out for off-year or midterm elections. Virginia may have finally broken the spell. 2. But, but, but ... can the lessons of Virginia work in states like Missouri and Indiana? If the Democrats' goal is to take back the House and limit their losses in the Senate, they have to figure out how to replicate their Virginia win in places that don't have the same number of affluent, well-educated suburbs. Virginia is a special place. In addition to that suburban population, it has thousands of federal workers who are focused on Donald Trump's presidency and what's happening in Washington, D.C., in a way that voters elsewhere just aren't. And there were limits to the Democratic victory in Virginia. They got their own coalition out, but they didn't make inroads with the Trump vote. White, working-class voters outside of the big cities and suburbs voted strongly for Republican Ed Gillespie, indicating that the Trump vote in Virginia was stable from 2016 to 2017. For Democrats to win a majority in the House and to hang on to Senate seats in red states like Missouri, Indiana and West Virginia, they need to reach out to those voters in an effective way. 3. Democrats need a message that resonates outside the suburbs In many states next year, Trump will not be the radioactive factor he may have been in Virginia this year. Democrats know they still need an economic message \u2014 something Hillary Clinton never communicated in 2016. Health care is a big part of this. It was voters' top concern in Virginia. Democrats are also hopeful they'll be able to run against the Republicans' tax bill, which is seen by large numbers of voters as favoring the wealthy more than the middle class. 4. Republicans are bracing themselves Off-year elections are traditionally tough for the party in power. Republicans now control all branches of government. Historically, when a president's approval rating drops below 50 percent, his party loses an average of 40 seats. So Republican operatives are telling their clients who represent suburban seats and those in districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 to get ready, raise a lot money, and pay attention to their constituents. Republicans have some structural advantages this cycle. Because they controlled the redistricting process in the majority of states after the 2010 census, most Republican members of the House are in safe seats. In addition to gerrymandering, Democratic voters are clustered inefficiently in urban areas. That means that Democrats have to win way more than 50 percent of the national vote for the House of Representatives in order to get 50 percent of the seats. The mighty fortress of redistricting helps, but it may not be enough to hold off a giant blue wave, if that's what ends up crashing on shore. 5. The solution for Republicans is \u2013 GOVERN! Republicans say their main task is to show that they can govern. They need to pass the tax bill and make sure the government doesn't shut down. They have some control over that. What they can't control is the president and his Twitter feed \u2014 both of which loom over the 2018 campaign. Midterm elections are always a referendum on the party in power, and they are often a reaction against the president. That's what happened to Barack Obama and the Democrats in 2010 and 2014. President Trump has yet to show how he helps Republicans when he's not on the ballot.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump used strong support among working class voters in key states to win an electoral college victory in the 2016 presidential contest. We hear from Trump supporters in Pennsylvania and Ohio.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Fifty-two weeks ago today was Election Day, and Donald Trump used strong support among working-class voters in key states, especially in the upper Midwest, to win an Electoral College victory in the 2016 presidential contest. All week we are looking at the impact of that election on our political system. And we're joined now by NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea, who is fresh off a trip talking to Trump supporters in Pennsylvania and Ohio, revisiting two big battleground states that Trump carried. Hi there, Don. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Hi. GREENE: So you were going back there not to meet new people but to actually find some of the people who you had spoken to before. GONYEA: That's right, and here's the shorthand. They don't believe the polls showing record-low approval ratings. They do acknowledge a learning curve for President Trump. And they say he has kept a very big promise, to drive the establishment nuts. But I heard more. So, David, just come along with me as I retrace my steps from a year ago. First stop is Washington County, Pa. This is coal country. It's where Christina and Frank Zaccone live. Carry-out Italian food had just arrived as we got reacquainted. FRANK ZACCONE: I put a knife on the stromboli. CHRISTINA ZACCONE: OK. Here's some, like, sauce and ranch if anybody wants that for their food. GONYEA: He's 31 and works as a coal miner. She is 32, a homemaker. They have two kids. Candidate Trump made big promises to coal miners and has cut some Obama-era regulations. Now, jobs are still being automated, and there's competition from other energy sources, but Christina Zaccone says at least they now have someone on their side. C. ZACCONE: And that's all we wanted. We wanted somebody that wasn't our enemy in the presidential seat. GONYEA: Frank Zaccone says he's confident Trump will be good for coal. F. ZACCONE: The initial steps are in place. GONYEA: This rural county was already Republican. But Christina, who has been involved with the local GOP for years, says she's noticed a big change. Party events are more blue-collar, she says, and with younger people. C. ZACCONE: You have them attending events. You have them going out and putting out signs for candidates. You have them participating in things that they would have never participated in prior to Trump. GONYEA: OK. Now to a more affluent suburb of Pittsburgh to the north, Murrysville. Fifty-five-year-old GOP activist Jill Cooper is a retired corporate marketing manager. She says party politics are changing here as well, but it was driven first by the Obama presidency. People got involved to oppose his policies. Then Trump came along, and she says he gave Republicans something to support. She recognizes that a lot of Republicans cringe when Trump tweets, but, Cooper says... JILL COOPER: And every day we get up, and even if you think Trump's having a bad day, you remember Hillary's not president. GONYEA: And Cooper dismisses Trump's low approval ratings. I asked her, does the president need to win over Americans beyond his hardcore base? She answers with questions of her own. COOPER: How's your 401(k) doing? How's your stock doing? He's created jobs. He's created economic optimism. What's the old saying? You vote your pocketbook. He's fine. GONYEA: Now, one more stop, northeast Ohio, land of shuttered steel factories. I'm back in the Top Notch Diner, just a bit north of Youngstown. Garry Frederick is the mostly retired co-owner of this place. He's a former Democrat who went for Trump. We get to talking about the Russian investigation. He believes what the president has tweeted, that there is no collusion. One year after the election, here's what surprises him, that Trump's problems in Congress have come not from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, but from Republicans. GARRY FREDERICK: They have the House. They have the Senate. Schumer can be mouthing off all he wants, which, who cares? We got the majority. All they got to do is get it done. GREENE: So interesting, Don Gonyea, that voice there. I mean, it sounds like some Trump voters, anything that's gone wrong for the president, blame Congress? GONYEA: Congress or the media. The blame goes elsewhere, though. And after a year of these conversations, here's what I've learned. Trump's core support is rock-steady, even if I do hear some grumbling from them about his constant need to fuel controversy. Some people say they'd like him to dial it back, but they're with him. And, David, they are happy to give him more time to win what have been, you know, so far elusive legislative victories. And some even predict that in a year this will be a much more smoothly operating machine in the White House. GREENE: Sounds like it was Don Gonyea kind of trip. GONYEA: It was always revealing. GREENE: NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea. Don, thanks. GONYEA: Pleasure. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, but she still emerged with support from two-thirds of the caucus.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul Morigi/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi faced her most serious challenge to her leadership post last year from Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, but she still emerged with support from two-thirds of the caucus. Democratic finger-pointing has begun after the party's loss in Tuesday's closely watched special election in Georgia, and for some members, the blame partly belongs to their House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat has long been a boogeywoman Republicans have used to motivate their base and to woo independents as the personification of liberal values. They paint her as a reminder of why even if they may like their individual member or candidate, a vote for that Democrat would be a step toward putting Pelosi back in the speaker's chair. In Atlanta, ads from the Congressional Leadership Fund that tied Democrat Jon Ossoff to Pelosi blanketed the airwaves. And after Republican Karen Handel pulled out the win, the leadership-backed superPAC said using the Democratic leader prominently was one of its most effective tactics. \"When asked, over 60 percent of voters preferred a congressman who would work with Paul Ryan, while only 28 percent chose Nancy Pelosi,\" CLF Executive Director Corry Bliss wrote in a memo on Wednesday morning. \"This became a focal point in our messaging, as well as other outside groups and the Handel campaign itself. CLF never deviated from the goal of defining Ossoff as a dishonest liberal.\" Pelosi isn't in danger of losing the leadership perch she has long held, though she did fend off her toughest challenge ever last fall from Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who argued the party needed someone who better understood the rural, working-class voters that were critical to President Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. Ultimately, Pelosi still got support from about two-thirds of the caucus, though the 63 votes Ryan garnered were the most serious defection Pelosi has ever faced. Ryan told NPR on Wednesday that the ads that Republican groups ran harnessing Pelosi's unpopularity with their GOP base voters were clearly effective. And running simply on an anti-Trump message \u2014 like Clinton tried and failed last year \u2014 wouldn't work for Democrats in 2018 either, no matter how mired in scandal and controversy over Russia the White House may be. Instead, Ryan argued voters want to know how Democrats will address economic concerns and grow jobs, and so far the party doesn't have a coherent message on that. \"You know you can sit here and we'll talk about Russia all day long today on Capitol Hill and in Washington. You go back to Ohio, they're not talking about Russia. They're not. They're not talking about Putin, Russia, Flynn. ... I just feel like we're so disconnected from what real people are thinking about. We're overwhelmed with our anger towards Trump. And I'm mad at Trump, but I'm madder at the Democrats for letting him get in. And we better focus,\" Ryan said. \"It's OK to be mad,\" Ryan added, but he argued that Democrats have to find a way to channel that into policy ideas. \"If you stay mad, you stay angry, you're unproductive. And I think you know the energy is good, but we better start moving towards a focus on an agenda that's going to help working-class people.\" Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who supported Ryan in the leadership elections, also said it was time for a change at the top, and that this loss \u2014 where Democrats poured in tens of millions of dollars only to do worse than Clinton did in the district \u2014 \"better be a wake-up call.\" \"Look, I think the Democratic Party has to come to terms with the fact that what we're doing isn't working,\" Moulton said. \"It's time for some change. I think it's time for a new generation of leadership.\" Moulton, a 38-year-old Iraq War veteran, was elected to Congress in 2014. He argued that when strategy doesn't work, there have to be repercussions at the top. \"Certainly, one thing I learned as a Marine is my job description was very simple: You're responsible for everything your platoon does or fails to do,\" Moulton said. \"I think our leadership owes us an explanation for what's gone on in these four elections, but also a plan for moving forward. That's the most important part.\" Other members were even more blunt in their assessment of the Georgia defeat and Pelosi's culpability. \"I think you'd have to be an idiot to think we could win the House with Pelosi at the top,\" Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Texas, told Politico. \"Nancy Pelosi is not the only reason that Ossoff lost. But she certainly is one of the reasons.\" For GOP consultants, tie-every-Democrat-to-Pelosi is a tried-and-true strategy that's been working for more than six years. Veteran GOP ad-maker Brad Todd says that's because the San Francisco congresswoman is the personification of the liberal values they can't stomach. \"There are plenty of people who have qualms with Trump on one level or another, but are totally willing to stick with him because the Democratic option is just too far left,\" Todd said. \"Pelosi is the human embodiment of that. She fits the stereotype of exactly what swing voters can't stand about the Democratic Party.\" In the Ossoff race, even though the 30-year-old documentary filmmaker and former congressional staffer ended up running a more centrist and not Trump-centric campaign, Republicans were able to zero in on the more than $23 million in donations Ossoff raised, largely from liberal enclaves like California and New York, and make an easy connection to Pelosi. One of their ads even features the Bay Area and branded the two Democrats together, putting his photo alongside hers on the Golden Gate Bridge. Pelosi allies have pushed back at the blame game and pointed to the improvement Democrats had in other special elections in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina as evidence that their efforts to harness the resistance against Trump was working. And they point out that even if Georgia's 6th District, which the president only narrowly carried, wasn't Trump Country, it was still a reliably red area that was going to be hard to overcome. \"In the previous election \u2014 the Republican candidate won by more than 20 points. To come within a hair's breath of winning that seat is nothing short of extraordinary,\" said House Democratic Caucus Vice Chairwoman Linda S\u00e1nchez, D-Calif. \"In the districts where we are truly competitive, I don't think that [anti-Pelosi] message is going to hold very much,\" said Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif. \"Look, they demonized Nancy in 2010, they demonized her in 2006. We're used to that,\" said New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell. A top aide to Pelosi dismissed the blaming, saying that Pelosi still enjoys broad support among the conference and that any party leader would be subject to partisan attacks. And she remains the party's most prodigious fundraiser, bringing in $567.9 million for the party since she joined leadership in 2002. Last cycle alone, she raised $141.5 million. In a letter to her colleagues on Wednesday about the special elections, Pelosi maintained an upbeat tone. \"Every effort was made to win last night. But we don't agonize, we organize \u2014 organize inside the House and mobilize outside for the good of the American people,\" she wrote. But with Republicans re-energized after the Georgia win, they're praying she doesn't go anywhere anytime soon. After she was re-elected Democratic leader, the Republican National Committee unfurled a banner that read \"Hire Pelosi\" outside its headquarters. \"It works only 100 percent of the time,\" said Todd, the GOP ad-maker. \"Pelosi is the gift that keeps on giving.\"",

Defeat is an orphan. Summing up the left's response to its deflating loss in a special congressional election in the Atlanta suburbs were two reactions: 1. Jim Dean, chairman of the progressive activist group Democracy For America, in a statement: \"Defeating Republicans in districts that they have traditionally held requires doing something drastically different than establishment Democrats have done before \u2014 specifically, running on a bold progressive vision and investing heavily in direct voter contact to expand the electorate. That's what it will take to win districts like this one in 2018 and take back the House. The same, tired centrist Democratic playbook that has come up short cycle after cycle will not suffice.\" And ... 2. Seth Moulton, a congressman from Massachusetts and former Iraq War veteran, who tweeted that the loss should be a \"wake up call\" for Democrats. He said the party needs to look to the future, have a \"bigger tent\" and a \"serious jobs plan\" and \"stop rehashing 2016\": We need a genuinely new message, a serious jobs plan that reaches all Americans, and a bigger tent not a smaller one. Focus on the future. The Democratic divide is highlighted pretty starkly in the string of responses to Moulton's tweet. Call it the Dean-Moulton Line of Demarcation: Be more progressive! Or \u2014 no, be more moderate where you need to be. Special elections can be overinterpreted. Believe me \u2014 some of us thought a special election to replace a Democratic congressman in a white, working-class district in Pennsylvania was a good sign for the party in 2010. It turned out not to be, and Democrats were \"shellacked,\" in President Obama's words, losing 63 seats and control of the House six months later. But Democrats did this to themselves. They hyped a race that they were hoping would be a referendum on President Trump, and more money was spent on it \u2014 more than $50 million with outside groups factored in \u2014 than for any congressional race in history. The party still doesn't know what it is or needs to be \u2014 and that can portend problems heading into next year's midterms. Should the party focus on Trump, whose approval rating is in the tank? (Pro tip: It wasn't so hot in the presidential election, either.) Or should it try to have something else to stand on and sell as a unified party vision? Can it do both? So far, Democrats haven't been able to walk that line. This year, they are 0 for 4 in special elections, from Kansas to Montana to Georgia and South Carolina. Some Democrats are taking solace in the fact that they fared better in each of those places than candidates who ran for those seats in 2016. And maybe with good reason. But Georgia 6 was the most moderate by far. Yes, Democrats need to win a net of 24 seats to take back Congress, and 47 districts held by Republicans are less conservative than Georgia 6. But it's the kind of district Democrats need to win to take back the House. It is the sixth-most-educated district in the country and chock full of moderate, suburban Republicans. (The top five most-educated districts are held by Democrats, as are 13 of the top 15.) Those Republicans chose their comfort level with their party and a candidate in Karen Handel, who is a known quantity, over someone with little experience \u2014 who didn't even live in the district \u2014 in Jon Ossoff. So is it possible Democrats can still take back the House? Sure, but it's always been less than likely because of how the districts are drawn. And this was a race they needed for momentum in the short run. The loss is already negatively affecting the \"resistance's\" morale and could hurt recruiting. That's not to mention what it could mean in Washington. President Trump tweeted that Democrats should stop \"obstruction\" and work with Republicans: Democrats would do much better as a party if they got together with Republicans on Healthcare,Tax Cuts,Security. Obstruction doesn't work! Trump weighed into the race, tweeting support for Handel. Handel didn't talk much about Trump on the trail but embraced him as the party's leader and welcomed him to the district if he so chose to go. Will that be how other candidates in somewhat moderate districts deal with the Trump factor? GOP leadership in the Senate is set to drop a health care bill this week, to be voted on next week. Had Georgia turned out differently, it's possible the bill would have been dead and something more moderate would have emerged. But Republicans don't see a need for that now with the wind at their backs again. What's more, there is already renewed pressure for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to step aside. She was the main focus of many of the Republicans' ads against Ossoff. Moulton supported Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in his failed bid for Democratic leader. Do those calls grow stronger? Pelosi staffer Drew Hammill defended Pelosi as the party's best fundraiser who keeps the conference in line: Right, let's abandon the party's best $ raiser & consensus builder cause Rs don't like a Democratic woman that gets things done https://t.co/FkmGdUUKGx Ossoff tried to walk the Dean-Moulton Line. Dean's group actually endorsed Ossoff, and he gladly took that San Francisco and Hollywood money. Ossoff did not campaign as the resistance candidate, though, despite that being projected onto him by the Democratic (and GOP) base. Progressives made this about Trump, even if Ossoff didn't, and they lost. On the ground, he didn't talk much about Trump and tried to appear moderate, talking about the issues important to the district. That didn't work either. It could be that Ossoff shouldn't have taken that outside money and refused the lefty image. It could be that he should have leaned in more to the anti-Trump messaging. Or it could be that a somewhat wooden 30-year-old documentary filmmaker and former Capitol Hill staffer didn't have much of a chance in the first place in a right-leaning district. The fundamentals of this race always favored Handel. As a former Georgia secretary of state who had run twice (and failed) for governor and Senate, she was better-known. The district has long been Republican. And there are far more registered Republicans in the district. With all the attention on the race, turnout was up for a special election, and that helps the party with the registration advantage. All of Ossoff's deficiencies would have been papered over by a win. With the loss, not only are they magnified, but so are the party's. And what is the party right now \u2014 a \"big tent\" inclusive party or one with label-shaming litmus tests, like the ones it used to criticize conservatives for having? How the party and its candidates should proceed from here sure sounds like the existential conversation Republicans were having with themselves in the age of Obama. The GOP put out an autopsy advocating for specifics after Obama was re-elected \u2014 in particular, calling on candidates to support comprehensive immigration reform. And then the rank and file nominated Donald Trump \u2014 and he won. Go figure.",

            "article_content": "Voters in the United Kingdom are preparing to go to the polls for Thursday's general election with three recent terror attacks weighing heavily on their minds.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Three months ago, British Prime Minister Theresa May called for snap elections. She had a majority in Parliament but was hoping for an even bigger one. She said she needed it to negotiate a strong Brexit deal with the European Union. And tomorrow the British will vote. But things haven't gone quite according to plan. Theresa May's opponent, Jeremy Corbyn, has run a much better campaign than expected. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports from the town of Watford. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEREMY CORBYN: A Labour majority in Parliament elected tomorrow will do things very, very differently indeed. (CHEERING) ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: On the last day of campaigning, Labour Party opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn was in the working-class town of Watford about 20 miles north of London. The town has voted for the Conservative Party in the last two elections, but today there was a big crowd to support Corbyn with a lot of young people, like Cameron Longer. CAMERON LONGER: Jeremy Corbyn is a vote for basic human values and decency. And he's here to change the lives of the ordinary working British person, not just the privileged few. BEARDSLEY: Andy Hopping, a lifelong Labour supporter, is having a pint in a nearby pub. He says the Conservatives, or the Tories, have taken the country too far to the right, doing things like privatizing the postal service. He says Corbyn has woken up young voters who realize the issues he talks about are important to their lives. ANDY HOPPING: He's talking about housing and education and hospitals. And all the youngsters are saying, yeah, we need to get involved in this. BEARDSLEY: Andy O'Brien doesn't think Corbyn will beat May tomorrow, but he says it's going to be a lot closer than when she called the election three months ago. ANDY O'BRIEN: Theresa May, you know, she's been pretty awful in the - you know, in the interviews here, and Jeremy's gotten better. There's been a lot of criticisms of Jeremy in the run-up there, and people have likened him to some kind of, like, fusty old teacher. And he seems to have sharpened up. BEARDSLEY: In the last three months, Britain has suffered three terrorist attacks - two in London and one in Manchester - that killed more than 30 people. Traditionally, the Tories are seen as tougher on national security. But given that the attacks took place on May's watch, political science professor Peter Catterall says that has upended their claim of providing stability. PETER CATTERALL: So the notion that if you return a conservative government it's going to be - the situation's normal has started to be undermined. BEARDSLEY: May has been under attack because as home minister, she cut 20,000 police jobs to save money. Corbyn says he will add back 10,000 police immediately and accused May of protecting the British people on the cheap. May has tried to get tougher. Yesterday, she said if elected she'll push for longer prison sentences and deport foreigners suspected of radical leanings. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY: If our human rights laws stop us from doing it, we'll change the laws so we can do it. (APPLAUSE) BEARDSLEY: Critics charge that not only is May ready to compromise core British values, but she's doing exactly what the terrorists want. This campaign may have started about Brexit, but since Saturday's attack on London Bridge, it's largely about which party can better protect the British people. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Watford.

Is Joe Biden plotting a 2020 bid for president? Don't entirely rule it out. The former vice president launched a political action committee this week \u2014 the surest sign yet he intends to keep his toe dipped in the White House waters over the next few years. On the new American Possibilities PAC website, Biden writes that \"the negativity, the pettiness, the small-mindedness of our politics drives me crazy. We're better than this.\" \"It's time to treat each other with dignity and respect. Not as opponents, but as fellow Americans. Because that's what we are,\" he continues. \"This is a time for big dreams and American possibilities. If that's what you believe \u2014 and you're ready to help elect folks who believe that, and to support groups and causes that embody that spirit \u2014 then I'm asking you to join me today.\" The PAC will allow Biden to fundraise and help candidates ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, which would allow him to keep up donor relationships as well as engender goodwill with future potential political allies, if he does decide to run. \"Joe is not going away, and you know that, all of you,\" Biden's wife, Jill, said on CBS's This Morning on Thursday. \"I mean, he loves politics, he loves what he's doing and he said he would stay involved.\" Ever since passing on jumping into the 2016 Democratic fray, there seems to have been a growing sense of \"what if\" from the former Delaware senator, who previously ran twice for president during his three decades in the Senate before joining then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's ticket in 2008. \"I regret it every day, but it was the right decision for my family and for me, and I plan on staying deeply involved,\" Biden said in January. The vice president wrestled with whether or not to join the Democratic race, which already included eventual nominee Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. And after his eldest son, Beau, passed away from brain cancer in May 2015, balancing his political ambitions with his grief and family obligations became a very public struggle. \"I don't think any man or woman should run for president unless, No. 1, they know exactly why they would want to be president and, No. 2, they can look at folks out there and say, 'I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this,'\" Biden told CBS's Stephen Colbert in September 2015. \"I'd be lying if I said that I knew I was there.\" And, ultimately he wasn't. Just over a month later, Biden announced in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by his wife Jill and President Obama, that he would not enter the race. \"As my family and I have worked through the grieving process, I've said all along what I've said time and again to others, that it may very well be that the process, by the time we get through it, closes the window,\" he said. \"I've concluded it has closed.\" But could that window re-open over the next three years? A bid by Biden would certainly be unprecedented in many aspects. He'd be 77 years old on Election Day in 2020. President Trump eclipsed former President Ronald Reagan as the oldest person ever elected to the presidency after he was inaugurated at age 70. The Democratic Party has no heir apparent to take on Trump in about three and a half years. And the Scranton, Pa., native, who relishes talking of his hard-scrabble upbringing, could certainly fill in some of the cracks Clinton was unable to, particularly with working class whites in the Rust Belt. But the party may also be eager for some fresh blood atop the ticket just four years after Clinton, who many saw as a retread candidate too tied to her husband's presidency in the 1990s. And a 77-year old Biden, with plenty of attributes Clinton was missing, still may not be their best fit. But it's important to watch how Biden uses his PAC in the coming months. Does he pay special attention to candidates in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, or travel there to campaign? Does he place an emphasis on battleground states? How forcefully and publicly does he go after Trump? Biden has been far from Shermanesque in his denials that he's seriously considering a White House bid, and his statements \u2014 often with a wink and a smile \u2014 keep stoking that very idea. \"I'm going to run in 2020,\" Biden told a group of reporters on Capitol Hill last December. After one reporter pressed him, \"For what?\" he responded with a smile, \"For president...What the hell, man.\" \"I'm not committing not to run,\" Biden clarified soon after. \"I'm not committing to anything. I learned a long time ago, fate has a strange way of intervening.\" Earlier this month when asked about running in 2020, this was his response: \"Could I? Yes. Would I? Probably not.\" \"I may very well do it,\" he later added, saying that if his health is good and if his family is in a strong financial position, he would consider it. In that same speech at the SALT hedge fund conference in Las Vegas, Biden also offered some pointed words in comparing himself and Clinton: \"I never thought she was a great candidate. I thought I was a great candidate.\" He did, however, later add that \"Hillary would have been a really good president.\"",

            "article_content": "by Edouard Louis and Michael Lucey Hardcover, 192 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Ever since the twin surprises of Brexit and Donald Trump's political rise, Western media has been obsessed with what's going on in the minds of rural and working-class people. In America, this helped make a star of J.D. Vance, whose book, Hillbilly Elegy, is looked on as a kind of Rosetta Stone to the psyche of forgotten America. In France, 24-year-old literary sensation \u00c9douard Louis has played a similar role. During that country's recent election \u2014 in which Emmanuel Macron defeated the right-wing populist Marine Le Pen \u2014 Louis' autobiographical novel The End of Eddy was seen as a bulletin from the enraged heart of Le Pen country. Yet Louis' account of growing up gay and poor in a working-class village isn't only a story about France. Just released in a highly readable translation by Michael Lucey, this painfully insightful tale of entrapment and escape could've easily been set in Michigan or West Virginia. When we first meet Eddy Bellegueule, he's being beaten up at school. It's clear to everyone, especially him, that he doesn't fit in. Secretly attracted to boys \u2014 with whom he starts having sex at a startlingly young age \u2014 Eddy's shrieky voice and sway-hipped walk get him identified as gay, although, naturally, nobody calls him anything so gentle as \"gay.\" Things are no easier at home, where his family struggles to make ends meet in their cramped house with concrete floors. His mother, who had her first child at 17, lives in a permanent state of rage punctuated by puffs of cigarette smoke. His father is a violent, hard-drinking factory worker who suffers vicious back pains from his job and eventually gets laid off. Both are disturbed by a son so unmanly that he doesn't even like soccer. As Eddy wittily puts it, they treat his obvious gayness as if it was some weird art project that he does just to annoy them. While Eddy's parents are both vivid characters \u2014 Louis has a great ear for their patois \u2014 what makes the novel special is the way it expands outward. Louis shows how his parents' values have been shaped by a profound sense of powerlessness shared with their neighbors in the village of Hallencourt, a blue-collar community bleak with unemployment, alcoholism, violence, racism and a deadening sense that life goes nowhere. Twenty-four-year-old novelist \u00c9douard Louis grew up in Hallencourt, France.\n                \n                    \n                    John Foley/Opale/Leemage\n                    \n                \nhide caption Twenty-four-year-old novelist \u00c9douard Louis grew up in Hallencourt, France. Hallencourt is the kind of place where the high school has the same architecture as the local factory, because you're supposed to go straight from one to the other. When Eddy's sister dreams of studying to be a midwife, everyone makes her feel this is too grand for someone like her \u2014 better off to be a cashier. As prisoners of economic forces they don't understand and can't control, the locals learn to take pride in toughing out miserable circumstances, and they loathe the style of the political and economic elite. When Eddy uses the term \"have dinner\" instead of his father's inevitable \"chow down,\" he's mocked for pretending to be part of a higher social class. In most classic novels about poor boys rising beyond their beginnings, the road to freedom is paved by a love of books, and Eddy is bookish by his family standards. He writes with artful precision about everything from his floundering attempts to de-gay himself by dating girls to the way Airness tracksuits brand village guys as lower-class. Ironically, what helps Eddy escape is the very thing that gets him abused: his gayness. Where the men around him, including his older brother, affirm their dignity by honoring a tough-guy image of masculinity \u2014 with its drinking, fighting, porn-watching and physical labor \u2014 Eddy is immune to that image's allure. There's an abyss between the name Eddy \u2014 chosen by his dad because it sounds tough \u2014 and who he actually is. He needs to get away. And eventually, he does. I won't say how, but The End of Eddy ends with the beginning of a journey, one that will lead him to change his name from Eddy Bellegueule to the classier \u00c9douard Louis. He will study in Paris, edit a scholarly book about sociology and appear on French talk shows where he'll explain how, even though he was treated cruelly, his parents and the Hallencourt villagers aren't intrinsically cruel. Instead, like so many people who feel abused by our globalized world, they were merely passing the abuse along.",

            "article_content": "The French presidential race has changed into a head-to-head contest between centrist Emmanuel Macron and a far-right candidate.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: French voters face a stark choice in next month's runoff election for president. Will it be the centrist Emmanuel Macron or far-right Marine Le Pen? Macron is now leading in the polls with previous rivals endorsing him. Yet as NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports from Paris, Le Pen cannot be ruled out. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French). ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: When she won a place in the final round Sunday night, Marine Le Pen went on the attack. Emmanuel Macron went out to dinner. The French watched Le Pen surrounded by her working-class supporters. They watched Macron clinking champagne glasses with elites at a chic Paris brasserie. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LE PEN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Le Pen calls Macron a candidate of the rich. She says he'll increase unemployment and mass immigration with his open borders and cut-throat capitalism. Political science professor Pascal Perrineau says the two candidates' shockingly different visions are now going head to head. PASCAL PERRINEAU: (Through interpreter) One vision is of social, economic and political openness. Macron is pro-EU and vaunts the charms of a multicultural society. It's the exact opposite for Marine Le Pen. She wants France out of globalization. She's against the EU, and she finds no charm in a cosmopolitan and multicultural France. BEARDSLEY: Some polls have given Macron a 20-point lead, and many voters from the mainstream right and left are expected to back him. But nothing has been predictable in this unprecedented election. The Socialist and Conservative parties have been eliminated and fragmented, and analysts say the old left-right divides don't mean anything. One example - supporters of the defeated far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon are vehemently against globalization, and a significant percentage of them may vote for Le Pen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANCOIS FILLON: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Conceding after the first round, mainstream conservative Francois Fillon said the far right was dangerous and urged his supporters to back Macron. But Fillon voter Stanislas Payet says he dislikes both candidates and will probably abstain. STANISLAS PAYET: At least she has a specific idea of what to do. On the other hand, Macron has nothing. He has no idea what to do, and Macron is just here like, I'm going to be president, but I don't really know why, you know? BEARDSLEY: Many Fillon voters say their candidate was defeated by a fake job scandal exaggerated by the media. They say Macron is an empty shell who benefited from Fillon's demise. Pollster Edouard Le Cerf says everybody knows the second round is not about voting for who you want. EDOUARD LE CERF: At the first round, you choose your candidate. And at the second round, you eliminate another candidate. So probably Marine Le Pen is the one the most voters will want to eliminate. Even if not all of them want to elect Macron, they will try and eliminate Marine Le Pen. BEARDSLEY: But many voters may not vote at all, and a high abstention rate may help Le Pen. (CROSSTALK) BEARDSLEY: Today, the battle for France unfolded at the Whirlpool factory in the northern town of Amiens. The plant is moving to Poland next year and laying off hundreds of French workers. Macron came to meet with union leaders at the Chamber of Commerce. When Le Pen got a whiff of it, she showed up at the factory gates. TV news showed her taking selfies with the adoring crowd. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LE PEN: (Through interpreter) I am here where I belong, in the middle of the workers who are resisting this savage globalization and shameful economic model. I'm not eating little cakes with a few representatives in some room in town. BEARDSLEY: Then Macron showed up at the factory. (CROSSTALK) BEARDSLEY: He was whistled and booed. The tense scene played out live on social media and French television. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) EMMANUEL MACRON: (Speaking French). (CROSSTALK) BEARDSLEY: Macron told the workers he felt their pain, but he would not make false promises. He said stopping the plant from closing would scare other companies from investing in France. This evening, media pundits are still debating who won the battle of Whirlpool. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MACRON: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris.

Much of President Trump's political strength comes from the fact that he won in places Republicans usually don't. In November, long-time Democratic states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin flipped from blue to red. He nearly did it here in Minnesota, too, a place that hasn't gone Republican since 1972. \"I didn't see it coming and most people didn't, obviously,\" former Minnesota state Sen. Tom Saxhaug said, as he looked out from seat in the front window of the Brewed Awakenings coffee shop in downtown Grand Rapids, Minn. Saxhaug is now retired, retired because support for Trump in this area helped swamp his own re-election bid. The Democrat (or more precisely the Democratic Farm Labor Party, or DFL) lost by a just 545 votes in November. Trump broke through in the Upper Midwest in a way no Republican has in a generation. But one of the lesser-covered or understood states where that was true was the liberal stronghold of Minnesota. The state stayed blue, but barely. Trump lost it by less than 2 percentage points, the best finish by a Republican in 32 years. Trump's populist message resonated with blue-collar white voters \u2014 something that has the potential to reshape the political map. But some of those same voters, though they remain supportive, are sending something of a warning signal \u2014 they wish he would be more presidential. \"There's a bit too much drama for me sometimes, with the tweeting,\" said Dean Morgan, a Trump voter and owner of SONSHINE Muffler and Brake, a religious-themed muffler- and brake-repair shop just a few blocks from Saxhaug's perch at the coffee shop. The Iron Range That was a sentiment heard repeatedly here in this mild-mannered Midwestern town of just under 11,000 people. It sits in the heart of Minnesota's eighth congressional district. It's a large and, in parts, rural district that extends some 300 miles, all the way from the Twin Cities' suburbs up to the Canadian border and includes the \"Iron Range.\" The Iron Range is home to mines of high-grade manganese ore that first opened after the Industrial Revolution at the turn of the 20th Century. It long supported this area, but fell on hard times in the 1980s, like a lot of other areas home to American manufacturing and steel companies. Efforts to diversify its economy have sputtered. In this district, the exurbs give way to forests with too many lakes to count. It eventually hits mine country in the Iron Range. People here like to say the economy is all about \"the Three T's,\" Taconite, Timber and Tourism.\" In less alliterative language, that's mining, forests and lakes. And with a population that's some 93 percent white, this congressional district has lots of the white, working-class voters who represent a big bloc of Trump's support. It's also one that has long been solidly Democratic. That all changed in 2016, going for Trump by better than 15 percentage points. 'Wish he were a little more reserved' A cross, rays of sunlight and \"JESUS\" in large block letters are all prominent on the signage of Morgan's auto-repair shop. Morgan is a born-again Christian, and he believes Trump is one, too. Even though that's not true \u2014 religious-right leader James Dobson had to walk back that same claim last summer \u2014 the thrice-married billionaire former playboy won a whopping 81 percent of white, born-again evangelicals in the 2016 election. Morgan said though he's still supporting the president, \"I wish he were a little more reserved, if you know what I'm saying.\" Asked if the Trump presidency has been what he expected, he hesitated before answering, \"You know it has, and it hasn't.\" Greg Gilness, a 66-year-old former steelworker, said of Trump: \"He's got a lot to learn.\" He added with clear frustration: \"I think he has to learn to be more presidential. He has just got to conduct himself like he's the president of a great power.\" Gilness stressed that he isn't a member of a political party and that he \"votes for the person.\" He wouldn't disclose which person he voted for in the presidential election. But, at times, he sure sounded like a Trump voter. \"I was leaning toward him,\" Gilness admitted, \"but I won't tell you how I actually voted.\" He spoke to Trump's appeal. \"People are looking for hope,\" he said, \"and he [Trump] gave a lot of people a little bit of hope to hang onto.\" That hope for Gilness specifically was economic. His plant closed down, and while he transitioned to an office job for the same company, he said he believes Trump will be very good for the mining industry. He expects Trump to do something about low-cost, imported steel \u2014 as he's promised. Rep. Rick Nolan holds a town hall in Virginia, Minn., on Wednesday.

Rick Nolan holds a town hall in Virginia, Minn., on Wednesday. The Democrat won a narrow victory in one of the most expensive contests in the country in 2016. Split ticket: A Democrat in what's now a Trump district There's a wrinkle \u2014 Gilness would say one person he voted for: his congressman, Rick Nolan, a Democrat. Gilness was actually at a Nolan event when he talked to NPR. Nolan has served the district since 2012. He previously served two terms in Congress in the 1970s, too. Nolan held on to win a narrow victory in one of the closest and most expensive contests in the country last year. He's been holding town-hall style meetings all across the district during the current congressional recess. The sessions have been courteous and polite, with none of the rancor and shouting that has marked some town halls around the country this year. Nolan spends time at each pointing out problems with the budget Trump has proposed, with cuts that he says will be bad for this region. \"Funding for the National Forest Service is gutted,\" Nolan said in an old city-council chamber in the small mining town of Virginia, Minn. So, too, Nolan said, is money for \"transportation, and funding for the Great Lakes.\" A mixed political bag Right across the street from the coffee shop, is a giant mural painted on the side of the building just across the street. It features the iconic characters from the classic film The Wizard of Oz. It's there because the movie's biggest star, Judy Garland, was born in Grand Rapids in 1922. (Fun Fact: Also born in this district \u2014 in Duluth \u2014 was songwriter, and now Nobel laureate, Bob Dylan, who grew up just up the road in the town of Hibbing.) As Saxhaug talks Trump, it's clear there's plenty he disagrees with. This self-described \"pro-gun, pro-mining, union-Democrat\" said of the president, \"He can't concentrate on anything long enough to accomplish anything. I'm real, real worried about the fact that he goes from one thing to another.\" He did not vote for Trump, but now, nearly 100 days into Trump's presidency, Saxhaug said, he is pulling for Trump to succeed. He said he'd be happy to back the kind of big infrastructure spending Trump has talked about (but not yet officially proposed in his budget or in specific legislation). He also noted that he could get behind tax reform, too \u2014 if it's done fairly. \"Just to be clear, you're a Democrat saying this,\" this reporter noted. \"Yeah,\" he replied. The GOP campaign headquarters for Itasca County, Minn., once was a place to go for oil changes. Now, it awaits its next life. Trump easily carried the county that former President Obama won twice.\n                \n                    \n                    Don Gonyea /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The GOP campaign headquarters for Itasca County, Minn., once was a place to go for oil changes. Now, it awaits its next life. Trump easily carried the county that former President Obama won twice. \"You're one of those Democrats who legitimately says you want him to do well, because that's good for the country?\" \"That's exactly right,\" he said emphatically. But other Democrats in the coffee shop were not so magnanimous. At a table over by the far wall, retired public-school teacher Frieda Hall was having lunch with a friend. She said she's been \"mortified\" by what she's seen from President Trump so far. Asked if it's what she expected, she replied, emphatically, \"Yes, exactly what I expected \u2014 a total chaotic mess.\" She doesn't trust Trump's judgment, his motivation, or the people he has surrounded himself with in his administration. She did say, though, that Trump has kept one promise \u2014 to be a disruptive force. \"He is disrupting the way things work \u2014 and to our detriment, and with no set goal,\" she said. Hall then asked, \"Like the goal of disruption is what? To disrupt? And then what?\" A call to end the drama Like him, or dislike him, people here in this place Trump won, tell you they want him to act more like a president. It was a common thread. They want an end to all the drama. World events are dramatic enough, they seem to be saying. For his critics, it's yet another reason to judge him negatively. But for those who like him, they will often just shrug and say, \"That's just who he is.\" And they find a reason to like him. Back at the brake shop, while Morgan says he wishes Trump would be more presidential, he shows no sign of abandoning him. He was quick to praise the president on foreign policy, for example, including the missile strike on Syria. \"I kind of go along with what what they're doing right now,\" Morgan said, adding about Syrian President Bashar Assad, \"I mean, this guy is killing babies with gas. \"It's like, 'Come on dude,' you know? This can't go on.\"",

In 2008, candidate Barack Obama ran an ad with this opening line: \"The hands that built this nation can build a new economy. The hands that harvest crops can also harvest the wind.\" And then it showed men working on roofs: \"The hands that install roofs can also install solar panels.\" The ad was directed at a group Obama was acutely aware he had to win over \u2014 white, working-class men. A quarter of those same men deserted Democrats in 2016, according to a New York Times analysis, and voted either for Donald Trump or a third-party candidate. On Tuesday, President Trump is trying to start making good on his promises to many of those same white men \u2014 coal workers. The Trump administration is doing an about-face on President Obama's climate and environmental policies. The president signed an executive order with a goal of taking restraints off businesses and boosting the coal industry. \"He made a pledge to the coal industry, and he's going to do whatever he can to help those workers,\" a senior administrative official said Monday ahead of the executive order's signing. Speaking at the Environmental Protection Agency headquarters, Trump said a \"new era\" in energy production is starting Tuesday. A delegate holds a sign reading \"Trump Digs Coal\" during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A delegate holds a sign reading \"Trump Digs Coal\" during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016. Surrounded by about a dozen coal miners, he said, per NPR's Jennifer Ludden, \"You're going back to work.\" He pledged to \"end the war on coal and have clean coal, really clean coal.\" But there are problems with both Trump's nostalgic Make America Great Again coal promises and Obama's radical vision for a reshaped economy. Trump's ignores the reality of a changing energy industry. Solar jobs, for example, have taken off over the past decade. The Obama administration tried hard to incentivize clean energy (so much so that it got caught up in the Solyndra scandal. The head of Solyndra was an Obama campaign bundler. Obama visited the company and touted it. His administration incentivized companies like it. In 2011, the government helped Solyndra refinance, but just months later, the company failed). But solar now accounts for some 260,000 energy jobs in the country, the majority of which are held by installers. That's almost four times the number of coal industry jobs, about 70,000, as of May 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And that industry has been on a steady and steep decline over the past 30 years: The number of coal mining jobs have been on a steady and steep decline over the last 30 years.\n                \n                    \n                    Danielle Kurtzleben/NPR/Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n                    \n                \nhide caption In the energy industry, solar is outpaced only by the oil industry, according to a major report by the Solar Foundation. And solar's gotten cheaper to produce (despite Trump's proclamations during the campaign that he loves solar except that it's expensive). As KQED, an NPR member station in San Francisco, reported in December, \"Power from big solar projects is about 70 percent cheaper today than it was a decade ago. Wind power has also come down.\" The problem for Democrats is where those jobs are created. It's not like the coal jobs that faded in West Virginia and Kentucky were replaced by solar. In fact, those two states rank 45th and 41st in solar jobs per capita, respectively, according to the Solar Foundation. That's not to mention Michigan (28), Wisconsin (26) and Pennsylvania (43), which flipped blue to red for the first time in decades. The top six \u2014 Massachusetts, Nevada, Vermont, California, Hawaii and Washington, D.C. \u2014 all went for Hillary Clinton. (California had more than a third of all solar jobs in 2016, over 100,000. And that was up 32 percent from the year before.) Conversely, the bottom 11 all went for Trump: Alaska, Arkansas, Alabama, Kansas, Montana, Oklahoma, West Virginia, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Wyoming and Kentucky. The states that voted for Clinton are largely run by Democrats; the ones that went for Trump are largely run by Republicans. In the Democratic states, clean energy is incentivized. In the Republican ones, it's largely not. People in those places also identify heavily as Democrats or Republicans, and there are stark splits on how to deal with the environment. On climate change, for example, a Pew poll from October found that 36 percent of Americans care \"a great deal\" about the issue of global climate change. But of that group, almost three-quarters (72 percent) were Democrats; just under a quarter (24 percent) were Republicans. There may be a fundamental reshaping that's taking place economically and politically, and the reverberations will continue to be felt.",

Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia at the White House on Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump sits between Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia at the White House on Thursday. President Trump met with a group of senators Thursday at the White House \u2014 six Democrats and four Republicans \u2014 in an attempt to build support for his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. Trump especially cozied-up to two of the Democrats: Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The president sat between them at lunch. \"Today we had a needed bipartisan discussion that will hopefully help our country by enabling the president and Congress to work together to get results,\" Heitkamp said afterward. Manchin echoed his colleague, calling it a \"very productive meeting.\" The two centrist lawmakers have a lot in common: They both represent states Trump won big in 2016. They are both up for re-election next year. And they're both on the White House's short list of potential cross-party allies in a narrowly divided U.S. Senate. Trump's overtures to Heitkamp and Manchin started shortly after Election Day. They were invited to Trump Tower for early meet-and-greets, and Trump flirted with, but ultimately passed on, tapping them to serve in his cabinet. They've also been rare voices of Democratic support for some of Trump's early actions, including advancing approval of two oil pipelines. Heitkamp and Manchin are two of 10 Democrats running for re-election in 2018 in states that Trump won. That makes them potential swing votes in the Senate this year, not just on the upcoming Supreme Court confirmation process for Neil Gorsuch, but on any number of Trump's legislative priorities. Trump will be confronted with one of a president's most frustrating roadblocks in Washington: the reality that most major legislative actions require 60 votes to get through the Senate. The White House's charm offensive also extended Thursday to Montana Sen. Jon Tester and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, who likewise represent states Trump won by double-digits. This group of Red State Democrats also includes Claire McCaskill of Missouri, another state Trump won by double digits. McCaskill did not visit the White House Thursday. The other five Democratic senators to watch represent familiar battleground states: Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bill Nelson of Florida, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan \u2014 all states with large white working-class voting blocs which swung hard in favor of Trump and the Republican Party, and which Democrats desperately want to win back in time for the midterms. While Trump carried Ohio by eight points, the remaining four senators are in more competitive states that Trump won by narrow margins of two points or less. Since Trump's victory, congressional Democrats have said that if Trump follows through on his campaign promises to negotiate better trade deals, protect entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, support paid family leave policies and spend more on infrastructure, he will likely find Democrats willing to negotiate on what have traditionally been parts of their party's platform. But skepticism is growing among Democrats that Trump will buck the Republican Party on those issues. Two of these Red State Democrats, Brown and Baldwin, have already declared opposition to Gorsuch's nomination for the Supreme Court, and they are staking out positions more in line with the party's progressive wing. McCaskill has avoided Trump but aligned with other Republicans: She has linked up with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., as a voice opposing Russia in Congress. And so far, Democrats have largely stuck together when the partisan heat was on, such as their unanimous opposition to Betsy DeVos's nomination for Education secretary. Democrats are similarly lining up to oppose Georgia Rep. Tom Price for Health and Human Services secretary. Heitkamp announced her opposition to Price Thursday afternoon, shortly after the White House meeting. (One notable exception: Manchin was the lone Democrat to support Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general.) The Gorsuch nomination fight will be one of the earliest test battles for how persuasive the White House can be with these Democrats, and which ones are willing to work with a deeply polarizing president. It's a political balancing act that these 10 Democrats will face for the next two years. Each senator, of course, will have calculations to make on how a given issue will resonate at home. But the challenge remains the same: Will voters in 2018 be more inclined to re-elect a Democratic senator who found ways to work with the Trump administration, or who joined the growing Democratic Party movement to resist him at every turn?",

Javits Convention Center. David Betras realized Hillary Clinton's odds of winning the presidency were in peril \u2014 back in March of last year. Betras, the chairman of the Mahoning County Democratic Party, lives in an area of Ohio that traditionally votes for Democrats. But during the Ohio primary, Betras saw 18 people on his own precinct committee defect and cross party lines to vote Republican. \"Why did they vote for Donald Trump?\" Betras asked rhetorically, and in the next breath answered his own question, \"'cause Donald Trump \u2014 I don't get it, but, amazingly, a man that s**** in gold-plated toilets \u2014 was talking more to working people than the party's standard-bearer.\" David Betras, chairman of the Mahoning County Democratic Party, said his party needs to get back to \"its roots\" and focus on the working class.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption David Betras, chairman of the Mahoning County Democratic Party, said his party needs to get back to \"its roots\" and focus on the working class. The people here thought \u2014 wrongly \u2014 the national Democratic Party cared more about where someone went to the bathroom than whether or not these people had a job. And, so we're off-message. David Petras, chairman of the Mahoning County Democratic Party in Ohio Quick fact check: While some apartments in Trump Tower do have gold-plated bathroom fixtures, there's no evidence of a gold toilet. But you get the point: Betras was frustrated with his own party, that it could not appeal to working-class voters while running against a New York billionaire. \"We were stressing the wrong messages. 'Stronger Together' \u2014 that's real nice,\" Betras said, referring to Clinton's campaign slogan. \"Let's sit around and sing, 'Kumbaya,' but that really doesn't get anyone a job, does it?\" The future for Democrats is fuzzy. Following President Obama, the first black president, the party is having something of an identity crisis. Clinton lost, in part, because she wasn't able to appeal to white, working-class voters, who were a crucial pillar of the party for decades. But minority activists warn that people of color have been a growing key to Democratic success for years \u2014 yet still don't have the influence they feel they deserve. While many in the party were encouraged by the massive turnout for the Women's March Saturday, which was bigger than the crowd that showed up for Trump's inauguration the day before, Democrats have no clear leader and no unified policy direction. Democrats suffered a stunning defeat in November, capping off a disastrous string of defeats during the Obama years. Democrats have lost more than 1,000 state legislative seats in that time, dozens of congressional and governors seats \u2014 and are at the lowest point of their power than at any time in the last century. In this post-mortem moment, Democrats can't even agree on why the party lost. Some, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton's chief rival for the nomination, say Democrats focused too much on identity politics and need to return to their economic roots. Others point out that identity politics is a necessary part of the game. They argue that Trump was playing to his own base of white identity politics and that black voters, for example, were among the most loyal Clinton supporters, so the party should not abandon them and cater to whites. And yet others insist that economics and race are not mutually exclusive choices, that it is possible to focus on both simultaneously. Figuring out that balance is going to be central to the party's survival, as it currently wanders in the political wilderness. \"Off message\": Concerns over economy, white, working-class ignored Betras, the county chairman, was so deeply frustrated by what he was seeing, he typed up a memo and sent it to the Clinton campaign in Brooklyn. Clinton did far worse than Obama in Mahoning Valley counties. Obama won Mahoning by 28, Trumbull by 22 and lost Mercer by 4. Clinton won Mahoning by 3 and lost Trumbull by 7, Mercer by 25.\n                \n\n                    U.S. Election Atlas; Domenico Montanaro/NPR\n                    \n\nhide caption \"I told the campaign they were in trouble with blue-collar workers,\" he said with urgency. He tried to warn the campaign that if it \"didn't retool [its] message,\" it would lose not only Ohio, but also other states with influential white, working-class voting blocs, like Pennsylvania and Michigan. Betras said no one ever responded to his memo. And Clinton went on to lose exactly as he had predicted. It was the first time a Democrat had lost Ohio and Pennsylvania since 1988 and the first time a Democrat had lost Wisconsin since 1984. A big reason for that was the bleed with working-class voters in the Mahoning Valley. Three counties make up the valley \u2014 Mahoning and Trumbull in Ohio and Mercer in Pennsylvania. Clinton suffered more-than-25-point swings in each county from Obama's performance in 2012. \"We could have saved those states, had they taken my damn memo [and] at least tried to do what I suggested for them to do ... start talking to these people about their jobs,\" Betras said. Clinton's loss shocked many Democrats across the country, but it didn't surprise everyone in Ohio, a traditional battleground state where Clinton suffered one of her largest defeats. She lost by more than 8 percentage points, the worst loss for a Democrat there since Michael Dukakis lost it by 11 in 1988. \"I'm not shocked that Hillary Clinton lost,\" said Precious Samuel, 29, a labor organizer in Cleveland. \"I saw the loss a mile away.\" In Northeast Ohio, Democrats said they saw the warning signs. And, so now, as Democrats look to rebuild, they also see lessons the national party can learn from Ohio. \"Here's the irony of it \u2014 all our local Democrats crushed the Republicans,\" Betras said, \" 'cause we're talking to those voters, we know how to talk to them.\" He, like other Ohio voters, pointed to the popularity of Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan (who tried unsuccessfully to challenge Nancy Pelosi, who won yet another term as the Democratic House leader). But Betras said the familiarity and trust many voters felt for local Democrats didn't translate to Clinton on the national level. \"The people here thought \u2014 wrongly \u2014 the national Democratic Party cared more about where someone went to the bathroom than whether or not these people had a job,\" Betras said. \"And so, we're off-message.\" Betras insists for most voters, the economy is the primary concern. And he is worried the Democratic National Committee doesn't understand that \u2014 that it has become too coastal, too elite and too disconnected from middle America. His prime example of the elitism he sees in his own party is the criticism he heard from some Democrats when Trump misrepresented the number of jobs in the Carrier deal. \"I don't care if it was a bad deal,\" Betras argued, \"he was fighting for someone's job. That's what we used to do, right?\" Betras said the pushback seemed horribly out of touch with working-class voters. And the Mahoning Valley is home to thousands of working-class folks, many of them white people who voted for Trump in November. \"Those are our voters,\" Betras said. \"Those are the people's issues we should be fighting for.\" \"Time for progressives to reclaim the party\" Leo Jennings III, a 61-year-old Democratic consultant and former union organizer, grew up in the shadow of the Ohio steel mills.

But those days are long gone, he said, in between bites of country toast and bacon at the Golden Dawn restaurant in Youngstown. \"There's no one around this area who believes for two seconds that the steel mills are coming back, because we all watched them flatten. ... They're gone,\" he said. \"But what they see is the rich getting richer and no opportunity for them to go to work.\" Jennings, a Sanders supporter during the primaries, said the only way his party can start winning again is by adopting a more progressive economic agenda. \"I think we've left a lot of people behind by this belief in trade,\" Jennings said. \"I think it's time for the progressives to reclaim the party.\" He added that in a year when people wanted to shake up the system, Clinton was the poster child for the status quo. Plus, he added, she didn't have credibility among many voters on issues like income inequality and wage stagnation, because of her flip-flop on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Jennings, like Sanders, thinks the party needs to focus on working-class issues above all else. \"If we don't start talking about the things that we can do to make it better for all working-class voters, we're bankrupt as a party,\" Jennings argued. Jennings added that working-class whites and blacks are affected by the same financial woes and that the Democratic Party needs to start talking about the economy in a way that rises above race. \"I mean, I don't think you have to abandon identity politics,\" Jennings said, \"but, at the same token, you have to talk to the issues that motivate the traditional Democratic base, because it's been decades where they feel as if they've been ignored.\" Both Jennings and Betras fundamentally believe race and class are not mutually exclusive \u2014 they say the dichotomy between identity politics and the economy is a false choice. \"I hate the [phrase], 'white, working class,' \" Betras said, \"and I reject that notion that somehow the white, working-class needs are different from the working-class needs.\" For both men, it's a matter of prioritizing the discussion. They see a focus on the economy as a way to ensure the party remains a \"big tent.\" A warning not to \"go and pander back to white Americans\" About an hour and a half west of the Mahoning Valley, in Cleveland, Chinemerem Onyeukwu, 23, part of a group called Ohio Young Black Democrats, echoed that message. He, too, wants a more progressive party.

Chinemerem Onyeukwu, Ohio Young Black Democrats \"If the Democratic Party wants to be around in the future, they need to go left,\" said Onyeukwu, an organizer for the state's coordinated campaign that worked to elect Clinton. Onyeukwu, like the Democrats in the Mahoning Valley, also thinks the party needs to focus more on the economy. He points out that's how a man named Barack Hussein Obama won Ohio \u2014 twice. But \"progressive\" politics for Onyeukwu is more than just the economy. He wants a party that is progressive socially \u2014 and culturally. He thinks the party could start winning again by investing more in young voters. \"The Democratic Party has not done a good job in developing the next generation of policymakers, of advocates, and activists, and politicians,\" Onyeukwu said. He feels that Republicans have made more of concerted effort than Democrats to develop a bench. He is worried that Democrats are going to keep running what he called '90s-style campaigns despite Clinton's loss. \"The people that they're talking about running in 2020 \u2014 they need to be in a retirement home, just old heads,\" he said, quickly adding, \"And, I don't say that to like be ageist ... [but] these people have sat at the top for so long, they don't even know what's going on in the rest of America.\" A few other members of the Ohio Young Black Democrats nodded in agreement. \"Hillary's not the problem,\" said Samuel, the labor organizer. \"The democratic process is the problem. And, making sure people feel included.\" Samuel said the Democratic Party doesn't seem to understand its audience. And for Onyeukwu, that audience includes many people of color. So he wants a party that also continues to push for more progressive policies on race. \"I want to guard against the Democratic Party, because they feel that they lost because white men and white women did not vote for Democrats,\" Onyeukwu said. \"I want to make sure that we do not abandon minority demographics to go and pander back to white Americans.\" Onyeukwu is concerned that identity politics has become increasingly taboo in some Democratic circles. \"As a party,\" he said, \"you should be robust enough to have multiple conversations with multiple groups of people at the same time.\" \"People of color are the base of the Democratic Party\" This debate over identity politics gets people like Jessica Byrd frustrated. She is an Ohio native who now leads a group called Democracy in Color, which calls for Democrats to invest more in minorities. \"We're talking about identity politics as if the only people who have an identity are people of color when we know that white men ... that's an identity too,\" she said. \"That's who came out and voted for Donald Trump.\" Byrd believes Democrats need to figure out how to create the most inclusive party possible. And, for her, that means not just expanding the tent, but also looking inside the tent. She noted that people of color have been key for Democrats to win elections for years \u2014 and yet, she believes they have not been given an influential enough voice in the party. She said without doing so inevitably hurts enthusiasm and grass-roots activism. \"The lack of diversity in the Democratic Party,\" she said, \"means that we aren't meaningfully able to engage in the conversations on the ground that actually get people to care about voting.\" She added, \"People of color are the base of the Democratic Party; it is our home. The difference, though, is \u2014 we're not allowed to make any decisions there.\" She argued that power dynamic needs to change, especially at a moment when the party is rebuilding. \"In a time where we are rebuilding our home, and we're like deciding what's going to go on the walls and what kind of couch we're gonna sit on,\" she said, \"we want everybody to come to our housewarming, [but] we also want to make some decisions about what that vibe is like.\" Byrd said the party doesn't need a huge overhaul \u2014 it just needs to do a better job connecting with the people already in the Democratic Party, particularly minorities, to make sure they show up on Election Day. Byrd argued part of what's getting lost in this moment of Democratic introspection is the technical failures of the Clinton ground game. Clinton lost Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by fewer than 78,000 votes combined. Winning all three of those states would have put Clinton over the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Clinton didn't make a single campaign stop in Wisconsin and did not pour in the kind of resources necessary to win Michigan. In each of those states, Clinton underperformed President Obama with young voters. Byrd, who worked on the Obama campaign in Ohio, said it takes extensive organizing and one-on-one conversations for Democrats to engage their base voters. \"We have to get back to believing that those resources being spent on human beings,\" she said, \"having conversations with other human beings, is meaningful.\"",

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told NPR, \"The goal is to rally the American people against a disastrous Republican proposal.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told NPR, \"The goal is to rally the American people against a disastrous Republican proposal.\" This week, the House and Senate took the first substantial step toward repealing Obamacare. Today, Democrats are holding rallies across the country, in an attempt to get some public momentum behind their longshot goal of blocking that effort. Congressional Democrats are organizing what they call a \"Day of Action,\" with events scheduled from California to Illinois to Maine. And in a demonstration of just how much clout the runner-up candidate in last year's Democratic presidential primary now has within the party that he's still not a member of, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will host the most high-profile rally of the day, in Warren, MI. Sanders played a major role in organizing the Obamacare rallies, sending out information about the events to the massive email list he gathered over the course of the 2016 campaign. \"The goal is to rally the American people against a disastrous Republican proposal,\" Sanders told NPR. He's hoping the rallies are the first step toward an \"outside-the-beltway\" communication strategy that could help Democrats cut into President-elect Donald Trump's powerful ability to set the daily political agenda. Since Congress came back earlier this month, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders have been pushing back against Republican proposals by doing what they normally do: holding big press conferences, doing TV interviews, and making the most of their time on the Senate floor. Earlier this week, Senate Democrats talked late into the night about all the good they say Obamacare has done. And when the Senate voted to take the first step toward an Obamacare repeal early Thursday morning, many Democrats broke Senate rules by trying to explain their \"no\" votes as they cast them. This is the typical minority party playbook. But it's much harder to break through all the noise in an era where President-elect Trump can basically reprogram cable news with a single tweet. Schumer is trying to get Senate Democrats more engaged on social media. But no one else in Washington has been able to dominate it like Trump. This clearly frustrates Sanders. He wants Democrats to reimagine how they get their message out, beyond floor speeches and press conferences. \"How do you mobilize millions of people,\" he asked, \"and get them to understand that the Republicans are doing exactly the opposite of what the American people want?\" That's what this Michigan event and all of today's other rallies are all about. Sanders tapped the massive email list he put together during his primary campaign, blasting out messages about the Michigan rally, and similar events across the country. He and Schumer will be trying to make their case in a state where Democrats typically did well with working-class voters \u2014 but faltered badly in 2016. \"There are many parts of the country that I could have gone to,\" Sanders said. \"But Michigan is a great state. It's a state where I did well in the Democratic primary. And is a state where Trump won.\" Democrats are now out of power at pretty much every level of government. Party leaders are trying to figure out their strategy. But so are grassroots activists. One place many liberals are turning \u2014 an online guide called Indivisible. It's basically a manual --- written by former Democratic Congressional staffers \u2014 that lays out ways that Democrats could use Tea Party tactics to fight Trump. Ezra Levin, who helped write the document, said the Tea Party did one thing very effectively. \"If they were in Texas, they didn't call members of Congress in California,\" Levin said. \"They knew that they were constituents of people who had a voice in Washington. And they focused on their two Senators, and their representative.\" That's what this guide recommends to Democrats trying to figure out how to organize. It offers practical tips like, how to effectively call a lawmakers' office, or how to best pressure a representative during a town hall. The guide's been read nearly 4 million times. Levin said he wants readers to understand that it's really easy for people to become politically active. \"This means getting a handful of your friends together, or joining an existing group. And just getting out there on a regular basis, at district offices or at member events. Or just making calls,\" he said. That kind of grassroots spirit is what lifted Sanders' surprising presidential campaign. It also got President Obama all the way to the White House. But when Obama tried to use his campaign apparatus and email lists to mobilize supporters in legislative fights, he had a mixed record. Now Sanders is trying to do the same thing. Today's rallies will be the first test of how much momentum he still has.",

Bernie Sanders talks to reporters about preserving the Affordable Care Act with fellow Democrats from both the House and Senate after a meeting with President Obama at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders talks to reporters about preserving the Affordable Care Act with fellow Democrats from both the House and Senate after a meeting with President Obama at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in Washington, D.C. Bernie Sanders thinks he has a pretty good idea why Hillary Clinton and Democrats lost in the 2016 election. \"Look, you can't simply go around to wealthy people's homes raising money and expect to win elections,\" the Vermont senator, who gave Clinton a surprisingly strong run for the Democratic nomination, told NPR's David Greene in an interview airing on Morning Edition. \"You've got to go out and mix it up and be with ordinary people.\" That picks up on a criticism of Clinton devoting too much time to fundraising \u2014 and not enough to on-the-ground campaigning in traditionally Democratic states, like Michigan and Wisconsin. In the general election, Clinton never visited Wisconsin after she became the nominee and visited Michigan late in the game. The two Upper Midwestern states swung narrowly to Trump: Wisconsin by slightly more than 20,000 votes and Michigan by slightly more than 10,000. During the primary, Sanders boasted of his small-donor donations. \"The Democratic Party swallowed the bait,\" he argued. \"They became hooked on big money.\" The Vermont senator added that he believes Democrats have lost touch with the needs of everyday Americans. \"I happen to believe that the Democratic Party has been not doing a good job in terms of communicating with people in cities, in towns and in rural America, all over this country,\" he said. Some have blamed Sanders, in part, however for Clinton's loss. Young voters were drawn to his campaign, but many chose a third-party candidate in the general election. Although Sanders campaigned for Clinton, at times he had a hard time voicing full-throated support for her. The kind of harsh criticism he leveled of Clinton on her Wall Street speeches and decrying her as part of the status quo, rather than building up her beliefs and policies (that certainly stand in stark contrast to Donald Trump) has irked party loyalists. That's especially true, considering that although Sanders ran in the Democratic primary and caucuses with Democrats, he has declined to put the \"D\" next to his name. He is back in the Senate as an independent. Sanders believes Trump's message resonated with workers, like the ones in Wisconsin and Michigan, who were hit hard by the economic recession and haven't yet recovered. It was a connection Democrats were largely unable to maintain. \"One of the reasons that Mr. Trump won is that we have millions of people who have given up on the political process, who don't believe that Congress is listening to their pain,\" Sanders said. \"What the Democratic Party has got to do is start listening.\" In that way, Trump and Sanders are alike. Both tapped into the anti-establishment current that permeated the 2016 election. When asked if he thought he would have been able to win the general election against Trump, Sanders brushed it off. \"I don't think it helps to relive history,\" said Sanders, whose campaign team touted polling during the primary that showed him faring better against Trump in head-to-head matchups. \"The answer is I don't know. Nobody knows. It's not worth speculating about. We are where we are.\" Sanders sees Trump's anti-establishment tendencies as a potential opportunity, at least when it comes to the fight to preserve Medicare and Medicaid. Trump promised repeatedly throughout the campaign that he would not cut Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security if elected. Sanders wants to hold Trump accountable for that promise, regardless of what Republicans in Congress want to do. Sanders says Trump has a choice: \"Either he can have the courage and get up in front of the American people, or do it through a tweet, and say, 'You know what? Hey, I was just kidding. I was really lying.'\" Or Trump can tell his fellow Republicans that they're wasting their time on legislation that cuts those programs. \"That would be the right thing to do,\" Sanders said. \"And I look forward to Trump telling the American people that that is what he intends to do.\" To press the issue, Sanders, along with congressional leaders, is calling on his colleagues to organize Jan. 15 rallies protesting threats to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid.",

            "article_content": "GOP lawmakers hope to vote on the tax plan before they head home for the holidays. And an electoral tribunal in Honduras has declared President Juan Orlando Hernandez winner of November's election.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Whatever this Republican tax bill does - does it help the middle class? Does it focus more on helping the wealthy? - well, the party and the White House are about ready to own this. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Yeah. And it could be President Trump's first big legislative win. The House is expected to vote tomorrow. The Senate, likely voting on Wednesday. But the debate over the bill's benefits continues. Here's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on CNN's \"State Of The Union\"... (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"STATE OF THE UNION\") STEVEN MNUCHIN: For low-income people and middle-income working families, their taxes are going down. INSKEEP: ...While Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen tells ABC's \"This Week\" that corporations are actually the big winners. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK\") CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: It's a huge giveaway to big corporations. Millions of middle-class taxpayers will see their taxes go up, even though Republicans promised that would not happen. GREENE: All right. Let's bring in Scott Detrow from NPR's Politics team. Hi there, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Morning, David. GREENE: So it looks like this is going to be the first major win for Republicans and President Trump. I mean, are they coming away with what they hoped for here? DETROW: Not all of what they wanted but a lot of it. They wanted to cut taxes. For a lot of people, they have. This will likely be the biggest tax bill to pass in decades. This was sold as a middle-class tax cut, though, and the bulk of the benefits here go to corporations and the wealthy. Republicans also talked a lot about simplifying the tax code. And in the end, this remains just as complicated as ever - seven tax brackets, everything else. You know, given how the year is gone, it seemed like Republican leaders, in the end, weren't looking for a personal record here. They just wanted to finish the race and get something done that they could campaign on. GREENE: Looked to be in question just days ago, when it looked like some senators were uncertain - but you had Republican Senator Bob Corker, who had been a no on this bill, he has even come around now after a late provision was added. Right? What can you tell us about that? DETROW: He's a great example of that mindset. He had had major problems all along, specifically when it comes to how this would raise the debt. And he voted no the first time around. But Corker said last week this is a rare opportunity for Republicans to boost the economy. He didn't want to stay in the way of it. But he will be an interesting voice to watch this week. There was reporting over the weekend that a provision added into the bill in conference would really help Corker's commercial real estate business. He's on the defensive here. He released a letter last night saying he had nothing to do with that and asking Senate leaders how this got into the bill. But you can expect a lot of pressure on Bob Corker between now and the vote on that issue. GREENE: Yeah. It sounds that way. Well, another story we're going to be following all this week - I'm sure, Scott - Robert Mueller's investigation that the Trump transition team, their lawyers, have been really trying to discredit the special counsel. They say he illegally obtained emails. Mueller's denying that he did anything wrong here, that it was just the course of a criminal investigation. But my question is about these emails. What do they tell us about where his investigation is going? DETROW: Well, the transition seems to be such a big focus of the investigation. Remember, Michael Flynn has already pleaded guilty to lying about his meeting with Russia's ambassador during the transition. So the fact that Mueller has thousands of emails, that they come from top transition aides during this period - could be really notable. It's also an interesting example of how much Mueller and his investigation are being attacked by Trump allies and how little he's willing to do in the public sphere to respond right now. He's letting the work speak for itself. Might make sense in a criminal organization - politically, questionable. INSKEEP: And there is a political dimension to complaining about how these emails were obtained. But ultimately, as Muller knows, it's going to be decided by a judge. If there really is some question about whether this is legitimately obtained evidence, it's going to be thrown out of court. GREENE: NPR's Scott Detrow. Thanks, Scott, we appreciate it. DETROW: Thanks, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, let's talk about Honduras now, a country where there are calls for a new election. INSKEEP: Yeah, many people have been contesting the results ever since the vote on November 26. Protesters contend there was widespread fraud. Violent protests have led to the deaths of at least 17 people, we're told. Now, yesterday, an electoral tribunal declared that the current President, Juan Orlando Hernandez, is the winner. But then the Organization of American States - it's kind of like a United Nations for the Western Hemisphere - the OAS said the election deserves a do-over. GREENE: Well, let's bring in NPR's Carrie Kahn from Mexico City. Hi, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning. And sorry for the scratchy throat. It was my Honduran souvenir. GREENE: No, we all have been going through that. It's that time of year, isn't it? INSKEEP: Tea with honey is good for that, Carrie. GREENE: Yeah... KAHN: Doing that right now. GREENE: ...And lemon juice with water Carrie, the OAS, as Steve mentioned - sort of like the U.N. for that region, right? So this is the big deal that they're calling for a new election in Honduras. KAHN: This is pretty big. And it was - they gave a stunning list of reasons why they felt there needed to be new elections. The head of the election monitoring mission in Honduras presented them in a lengthy press conference last night. It was so technical, but I'll just give you some of the most stunning irregularities they noted. They said there were deliberate human intrusions into the computer system that counted the vote. They said there were intentional elimination of digital traces in the system. And they even pointed to open ballot boxes. And this one was most troubling - they asked a Georgetown University professor to analyze the results. And he concluded that there was an extreme statistical improbability that late election returns could have swung so heavily toward the incumbent who declared the winner. So the observer team gave the electoral process a poor grade. And then the secretary general of the OAS said last night, it's impossible to say with any certainty who won. Let's do a do-over. GREENE: Wow. So I mean, that - a lot of technical language but basically saying, like, this election was rigged in a serious way. KAHN: They don't go that far, but they were pretty close to it. GREENE: But the technical language suggests a lot, I guess. So - well, President Hernandez's rival Salvador Nasralla was, I know, in transit when the declaration of the winner came out. What is Nasralla saying about these accusations? KAHN: Yeah. He was on his way to Washington, D.C., to meet with the OAS and U.S. officials. And he had a stopover in Miami. And he went on Facebook from the airport terminal decrying the decision by the electoral officials. And he urged the Honduran people to continue fighting. In Honduras, his ally, the former president Mel Zelaya, read a statement urging people to take to the streets to protest. And he also made a stunning declaration, which sort of took me a bit aback. He urged the armed forces and the National Police to only take orders from Salvador Nasralla and not repress the people as they continue to protest. GREENE: This sounds, potentially, very tense and like the violence might not be over in that country. KAHN: Definitely, it is a very tense situation. It's uncertain how it's going to be resolved. They would have to do this election before the middle of next month, when the new president is supposed to take office. So it's unclear how they'll proceed now. INSKEEP: This has become a global feature of democratic elections - hasn't it? - questions again and again and again about the legitimacy of the election, questions about whether somebody messed with the computer systems in computerized votes. The same question was raised about the 2016 election here. Now we should be clear - no evidence whatsoever that votes were actually changed here in the United States in 2016 - but apparently, different questions being raised in Honduras. GREENE: Yeah, not a nice way to... KAHN: Definitely, we'll have to see what the United States and the Trump administration says about this. For now, they've been mum on the irregularities. They've asked for a transparent process but have been silent on these questions that the OAS has raised. GREENE: NPR's Carrie Kahn, reporting from Mexico City. Carrie, thanks. KAHN: You're welcome. GREENE: And feel better. KAHN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF THE NATIONAL'S \"THIS IS THE LAST TIME\") GREENE: All right, I'm going to say this. Disney made a jump to box office hyperspace over the weekend. INSKEEP: (Imitating spaceship whirring). \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" brought in an estimated $220 million domestically, which is the second-best opening ever in North America, beaten only by the same movie's predecessor, \"The Force Awakens.\" This news came within days of Disney's announcement - Disney produced \"The Last Jedi\" - Disney's announcement that it plans to buy much of 21st Century Fox. INSKEEP: Quite a moment for Disney. Hadas Gold is a media reporter for CNN. She's with us. Hey, there. HADAS GOLD: Hello. GREENE: So Disney has this good run here. They're now buying much of 21st Century Fox - or they plan to. Are we going to feel some kind of change from all that? GOLD: We will. Disney is planning, really, for the future in this deal. They are buying most of 21st Century Fox's movie and television production content, including their stake in Hulu, that streaming service. For Disney, this is all about streaming. They are planning not only to continue with their ownership stake of Hulu - they now own 60 percent of it once this deal goes through - they also are planning to launch two other streaming services, one focused more on sports and one will focus more on sort of children and entertainment. So now they've got sports, children and entertainment, and then Hulu will be more for adults. And this is really a consolidation of all of this content to get them more ways to bring their content to consumers in the ways that consumers are now watching television and movies, which is on their phones, tablets and over streaming. GREENE: So if Disney has its hand in more and more content, then, creatively speaking, does that mean that movies and content are going to look more and more similar? GOLD: Not necessarily. If you look at Disney's history - for example, when they took over Pixar - they tended to sort of let them be and do their own thing creatively. Obviously, with any sort of big ownership, we are going to see some changes. And in Hollywood right now, they're going to be some free agents - some presidents, maybe, of various studios. But for the most part, the way we've seen Disney handle these types of things before is we should see things just kind of continue the way that they have been before. However, if you are really looking for that \"X-Men\" versus \"Avengers\" matchup, you may actually get to see that now. GREENE: (Laughter) OK. That's good news. So it does - I mean, bottom line, it means less choice for entertainment, even if Disney tries to let some of these parts of Fox stay true to who they were in the past. GOLD: Yeah, Disney says, you know, that they are - this is better for consumers. But analysts that I've spoken to said, actually, this will decrease competition and decrease choice, which could potentially mean higher prices for consumers because Disney will control so much of the content and will now also possibly control how we consume that content as well with their streaming service. GREENE: All right, Hadas Gold is media reporter for CNN, talking to us about Disney, which had a big win at the box office with \"The Last Jedi.\" And they're ready to buy a lot of Fox, so it's quite a moment. Hadas, thanks. We appreciate it. GOLD: Thanks, everyone. (SOUNDBITE OF HENRY JACKMAN'S \"FIRST CLASS\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Trump and congressional Republicans have pitched their tax plan as a boost for the middle class. \"The rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,\" Trump told reporters during a meeting with lawmakers in mid-September. But analysts at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who studied the proposal reached a very different conclusion. They predict that nearly three-quarters of the savings from the tax overhaul would go to the top 20 percent of earners \u2014 those making more than $149,000. More than half the savings would go to the top 1 percent \u2014 people who earn more than $732,800. The tax breaks are even more tilted to the wealthy by the 10th year of the overhaul, when the Tax Policy Center projects nearly 80 percent of the savings would go to the top 1 percent of earners. Administration officials have tried to discredit the center's analysis, noting the tax plan is so far just a framework with many of the details still to be filled in by Congress. \"All I can tell you is that no one can make real detailed analysis of the plan yet, because it's not finished,\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. The Tax Policy Center analysts acknowledge having to make some assumptions as they did their review. They based those assumptions on reasonable sources, including past Republican tax blueprints and the administration's own April outline. The center has promised to revise its forecast as lawmakers fill in the blanks of the tax plan. But the big picture is not likely to change. \"It's going to be hard to mold this into something where the middle class is the big winner. And the reason for that, or course, is that the upper-income earners are those that pay the most in taxes,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"If you're going to reform the tax code, a lot of times it's going to be the people who pay the most taxes who end up with those bigger breaks.\" Wins for middle class appear largely indirect The tax benefits for the rich in the GOP plan are direct, obvious and easily quantified. Many of the promised benefits for the middle class, on the other hand, are indirect, speculative and uncertain. For the wealthy, the government is promising to cut their tax bill directly, by offering a lower income tax rate and by doing away with targeted levies such as the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax. The AMT hits only upper-income taxpayers and the estate tax hits only people with nearly $5.5 million in assets (or nearly $11 million for married couples). The Tax Policy Center says eliminating those taxes provides a direct, $678 billion benefit to top earners over the next decade. The biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven't seen in many years. President Trump Many middle-class families would also benefit from a lower income tax rate, but their savings would be dwarfed by those the wealthy enjoy. The Tax Policy Center estimates the average middle-class taxpayer would get a break of $940 from the GOP plan next year, while a taxpayer in the top 1 percent would save $146,470. For those on the lower rungs of the income ladder, the Republican plan actually boosts the tax rate from 10 to 12 percent. \"This is a GOP tax plan?\" tweeted an incredulous Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Monday, noting the Tax Policy Center's projection that nearly 30 percent of middle-class families could see their tax bills rise by decade's end. \"I hope the final details are better than this.\" This is a GOP tax plan? Possibly 30% of middle class gets a tax hike? I hope the final details are better than this. https://t.co/lcjkI4YRz8 So how do the tax plan's supporters claim that it's focused on the middle class? By highlighting speculative, indirect gains that are supposed to result from economic growth. \"This is a revolutionary change,\" Trump said in announcing the plan in Indiana last week. \"The biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven't seen in many years.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., makes a similar claim. \"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity that is all about more jobs, fairer taxes and bigger paychecks for American families,\" Ryan told reporters. Rather than simply promise that the government will cut the tax bill for working families \u2014 many of whom pay little income tax already \u2014 the GOP is arguing that its tax plan will promote growth, which in turn will boost employment, and over time result in higher wages. Break any link of that chain and the middle-class \"winnings\" end up in someone else's pocket. Cut to corporate tax rate A centerpiece of the GOP plan is a deep cut in the corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 20 percent. The Tax Policy Center estimates that provision, along with repeal of the corporate AMT, would save corporations nearly $2 trillion over the next decade. Where would that money go? Traditionally, it's been assumed that most of the savings of a corporate tax cut go to business owners or shareholders, who tend to be upper-income. But some portion also goes to workers in the form of higher wages. How those spoils are divided determines the big winner when corporate taxes are reduced. Forecasters at the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, for example, assume that about three-quarters of the savings from a corporate tax cut goes to shareholders, while the remaining one-quarter goes to workers. Until recently, the Treasury Department assumed a similar breakdown, with owners taking the lion's share and workers receiving about 18 percent. The Trump administration argues that a much larger share of corporate tax cuts \u2014 70 percent or more \u2014 will ultimately flow to workers. That's far from a consensus view, but it's the position advocated by Kevin Hassett, an economist formerly with the conservative American Enterprise Institute who now chairs Trump's Council of Economic Advisers. If Hassett is correct, that would shift more of the $2 trillion in savings from the corporate tax cut down the income ladder, from wealthy shareholders to middle-class employees. Standard deduction vs. personal exemptions Backers of the GOP plan say many middle- and working-class families would benefit from the near doubling of the standard deduction. That would exempt the first $12,000 of earnings for individuals and $24,000 for couples from income tax. The higher standard deduction would also free many taxpayers from having to itemize, making tax filing simpler. But while Republicans want to expand this tax break, they're planning to take away many others, including personal and dependent exemptions, which reduce taxable income by $4,050 for each taxpayer, spouse and dependent in a household. This combination could leave a couple with two children worse off. Their standard deduction would increase by $11,300 (from $12,700 to $24,000). But their four exemptions, totaling $16,200 would disappear, leaving them with more taxable income and a higher tax bill. For couples with three or more children, the situation is potentially worse. This might be offset by a larger child tax credit Republicans have promised, but that depends on details that have not yet been worked out. In addition, taxpayers who continue to itemize would lose their personal exemptions without the offsetting benefit of a larger standard deduction. The Tax Policy Center estimates that boosting the standard deduction will leave an extra $830 billion in taxpayers' pockets over the next decade, while eliminating personal and dependent exemptions will increase taxes by $1.6 trillion. State and local tax deduction Republicans have promised to preserve the tax deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving, along with unspecified tax incentives for retirement savings, work and higher education. Most other tax breaks are on the chopping block, but the only one that lawmakers and the administration have singled out for elimination is the deduction for state and local taxes. \"One of the things we're trying to do is eliminate lots and lots of deductions,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told NBC's Meet the Press. \"One of those deductions is about getting the federal government out of the business of subsidizing the states.\" If state and local taxes were no longer deductible, the federal government would collect an extra $1.3 trillion over the next decade, according to Tax Policy Center. The move would particularly hurt taxpayers in relatively high-tax states, many of which lean Democratic. According to the Tax Foundation, more than half the total value of the deduction is claimed by taxpayers in just six states \u2014 California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania. With the exception of Texas, all of those are blue states. But as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., points out, there are many taxpayers in GOP districts who would be unhappy to see the deduction for state and local taxes taken away. \"My guess is you're going to have 30, 40, 50 Congress members \u2014 Republican \u2014 who say, 'I can't vote for this because it raises taxes on my core constituency,' \" Schumer said on Sept. 27, the day the plan was released. The role of economic growth The administration and congressional Republicans describe their tax plan as a key ingredient in the recipe for faster economic growth. They're counting on that to boost federal revenues. \"We believe there will be $2 trillion of additional growth\" over the next decade, Mnuchin told ABC's This Week. Many independent observers think that's overly optimistic, especially with the economy near full employment, an aging workforce and an administration determined to limit immigration. \"We've seen a lot of modeling of tax plans before and we've seen what's happened when we've reformed the tax code before,\" said MacGuineas. \"You can grow the economy by \u2014 perhaps if it's done well \u2014 a couple of additional tenths-of-a percent of GDP. And that would be great. We should celebrate getting that done. But we should also be realistic and we shouldn't try to pay for things with wishful thinking.\" The Tax Policy Center says it expects the GOP plan would have \"little macroeconomic feedback effect on revenues over the first decade.\" Effect on deficits and debt The tax cuts in the GOP proposal would reduce government revenues by trillions of dollars. Some of that would be offset by closing (mostly unspecified) loopholes. But the Tax Policy Center still predicts an extra $2.4 trillion in red ink over the next decade. If Republicans' promised level of economic growth fails to materialize, all of that would be added to the federal debt. That worries deficit hawks like Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. He expects to raise some revenue by eliminating tax breaks and through economic growth. But Corker told NBC's Chuck Todd that he's not willing to put the balance on the government's credit card. \"If it looks like to me, Chuck, we're adding one penny to the deficit, I am not going to be for it, OK?\" said Corker, who is not planning to run for re-election. With a narrow two-vote majority in the Senate, Republicans can ill afford further defections.",

            "article_content": "Questions remain about how President Trump and lawmakers are going to pull off the broad tax overhaul plan. Life in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico is difficult \u2014 compounded by severe fuel shortages.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: There are a whole lot of questions still about how President Trump and GOP lawmakers are going to pull off what the president calls a, quote, \"middle-class miracle.\" MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Yeah, that miracle is the tax overhaul plan that the president unveiled just yesterday. It'll fall to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to determine a lot of the specifics and also to try to sell it to other lawmakers - so a lot to unpack about what could be in store for taxpayers. And meanwhile, Rachel - one other political story to keep an eye on, and that is the president's response to how one of his cabinet members reportedly used taxpayer dollars to pay for private jets. MARTIN: OK, we're going to get to all that with NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro. Hey, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: All right, let's get into a little bit of fact-checking to start the day. The president says his tax overhaul plan is not about helping wealthy people get tax breaks. So based on what we know about it so far, is that true? MONTANARO: No. I mean, first, we should say there are things that do benefit the middle class. The biggest thing - a doubling of the standard deduction, so most people, you know, wouldn't have to figure out all those pesky itemized deductions, most likely. And some people would see a reduction in their tax rate, but some will likely pay more because of the new structure. As for whether or not this benefits wealthy people and business owners like President Trump, of course it does. I mean, there's a decrease in the tax rate for the highest-income earners. The repeal of the estate tax, a tax on wealthy families that leave money to their children - that tax only affects those with estates of $5 1/2 million or more. There's a repeal of the alternative minimum tax aimed at high-income earners and a massive reduction in the corporate tax rate. Trump, of course, wealthy and a business owner - so either the president doesn't know what's in his plan or he's lying. MARTIN: All right, so let's talk about the political implications of all this because I imagine there's a lot at stake here. The president has been unable to get Republicans behind some kind of overhaul of the health care plan - repeal and replace - so he needs this. But what does the path to passing a tax overhaul bill look like at this point? MONTANARO: Well, they're going to start work on this next week, and that's kind of the big piece of it. Of course, this is already shaping up to be a big partisan fight. You know, there's money - money is always a sharp dividing line within the parties. It indicates priorities, and Democratic leaders are calling this a big giveaway to the rich. But it's also very possible that some Democrats are going to sign on. There are 10 Democrats up for re-election next year who are in states that Trump won, including Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who was with Trump yesterday at his speech on this plan. MARTIN: All right, before I let you go, let's get to this kerfuffle with Tom Price, the secretary of Health and Human Services. He's being investigated for using taxpayer-funded private jets for government business, and now President Trump has weighed in on this. MONTANARO: Yeah, it - look, he said he's not happy with Price. When he was asked if he'd fire him, he said, we'll see - huge red flag if you're in the administration, never a good sign, especially in the Trump orbit. And remember, Trump threatened Price's job during a speech before the Boy Scouts over the summer. He said that if Price didn't get the votes on health care, he'd be fired. They didn't get the votes on health care. And now, you know, it appears that he's sort of threatening his job. He's trying to pass a tax plan too, and he can't have the optics of someone who's appearing to try and take advantage of taxpayers for his own gain. And he's not the only cabinet member with a private plane problem, Rachel. MARTIN: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks so much for talking with us, Domenico. MONTANARO: Oh, you're welcome, as always. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, we're going to turn now to Puerto Rico, where it has been just over a week since Hurricane Maria ravaged the island. Conditions there are still very dire. Everything is made worse because people can't get fuel. KELLY: And Rachel, we're talking fuel, not just the lack of gasoline, but the few places that do have electricity are running on diesel-powered generators. And that's also in scarce supply. Lack of diesel is coming - is emerging as a real problem for hospitals and others in need of lifesaving equipment. One doctor, Pedro Escobar (ph), who works at a hospital in San Juan, was saying they had power yesterday, but he is still worried. PEDRO ESCOBAR: We have hundreds and hundreds of patients who are either schedule or they're getting chemo. So then after that, they need to get operated within four or five weeks. Otherwise, you know, the outcomes are not going to be good. KELLY: So some big challenges ahead for medical facilities across Puerto Rico. MARTIN: Yeah, OK, NPR's Greg Allen has gotten a firsthand look at a hospital in San Juan. He's on the line now. Greg, tell us what you've seen. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Well, you know, this is a health care system that's stretched very thin right now. The only thing that's still open on this island for health care are hospitals. Doctors' offices and walk-in clinics are all closed, and they're starting to see a rise in storm-related cases here, things like accidents but also things like respiratory problems and people who haven't treated their diabetes because they can't keep their insulin refrigerated. So this - health care is still a real issue here. As you say, hospitals right now are all running on emergency power, which are diesel-fueled generators. The hospital I visited yesterday had run out of power and actually had to discharge patients earlier this week because they didn't have any electricity on at all. So the - it's a real problem here. There are some local hospitals the federal government is working with the Commonwealth to set up. But the question is, what about chronic patients who need this ongoing care - dialysis, diabetes treatments, that kind of thing? Also, as Dr. Escobar said, surgeries are being postponed, chemotherapy treatments. So lot of questions right now about people going to get health care here in Puerto Rico. MARTIN: Wow. So as you know, the federal response to this crisis has been criticized as being so slow. What have you been able to learn about why it's taken so long to get fuel and other supplies to the people who need it? ALLEN: Well, some of that you can't really pin on the federal government. So the belief is that it's really up to governor and (unintelligible). They're moving to give (unintelligible) to the mis-palleted (ph) pier. And containers are just piling up at the port. They're not getting out. Part of the issue is that the (unintelligible) fuel out... MARTIN: Oh, you're - I'm going to interrupt you for a second, Greg, just to paraphrase what you're saying. You are on a rough phone line from San Juan. You're saying that the port is just full of these containers and just the layout of the island is making it difficult to just get the supplies where they need to go. ALLEN: But the governor said yesterday the problem is, there's just not enough trucks here on the island to do - to get the material out. And they're right now still concerned about fuel. They can't even get the diesel and the gasoline delivered to all the places that need it. So logistics is a major issue. The armory reserve is exporting deliveries. We'll see if the military takes a larger presence here in the days to come. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Greg Allen has been reporting from San Juan, Puerto Rico, on the aftermath of the Hurricane Maria that passed through there. Greg, thanks so much for your time this morning. ALLEN: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK, President Trump's Supreme Court pick - that would be Justice Neil Gorsuch, the newest member of the court - he is expected to give a speech today to a conservative group here in Washington, D.C. KELLY: Yup, and nothing unusual about that - about a Supreme Court judge addressing a group with a particular political bent. This speech is controversial because of where Gorsuch is going to be talking. He will be at the Trump International Hotel here in D.C. ROGER REAM: We did not select the hotel because we were trying to send a message of support to President Trump, as some have suggested. We just thought it was a new, elegant hotel, and we'd try it. KELLY: That's Roger Ream of The Fund for American Studies, which is the group that is putting on this event. But there are a lot of other groups who are calling on Gorsuch to back out. MARTIN: NPR's Jackie Northam is following all of this. Hey, Jackie. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: First, tell us, is Trump's hotel going to profit in any way from this event? NORTHAM: Oh, sure, yes. There'll be about 180 invited guests to hear Gorsuch's speech. And then, you know, the Trump hotel will make money off the room where it's being held, food, drinks, parking. And this is an expensive hotel, just a - you know, a few blocks from the White House. MARTIN: And we should say, money that goes into the hotel ultimately finds its way back to the Trump family who is running all of the Trump enterprises. NORTHAM: That's right. MARTIN: So are there any rules that Neil Gorsuch is breaking by appearing at this event? NORTHAM: No, he's not crossing any legal lines, certainly. And the legal experts I spoke with said they didn't really think he was violating any ethical rules. But, Rachel, the problem here is the optics. You know, Justice Gorsuch was President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, and now he's delivering a speech at Trump's hotel. And there are cases involving the Trump administration that could come before the high court, such as the travel ban, and the Trump hotel itself is in the center of several lawsuits. So there's concern Gorsuch's speech at the hotel could undermine the public's confidence in the independence of the court. I spoke with Stephen Gillers, and he's an ethics professor at New York University law school. And he said, Gorsuch isn't breaking any rules, but the appearances are all wrong. In other words, just because Gorsuch can do it doesn't mean he should do it. MARTIN: Any sign Gorsuch himself has had second thoughts about this because of all the criticism he's been getting? NORTHAM: No signs, no. It looks like he's a justice who's going to go his own way. You know, last week, he was just down at the University of Kentucky where he was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for a speech. And it was McConnell who helped secure a speedy vote to get Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and he got criticism for that. So - and then Gorsuch is due to speak with the Federalist group, which is a conservative legal group, sometime in November. MARTIN: All right, NPR foreign affairs correspondent Jackie Northam - she's been covering all of the ethics concerns when it comes to the Trump International Hotel here in D.C. The newest member of the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch - scheduled to give an address there to a conservative group this afternoon. Hey, Jackie, thanks so much. NORTHAM: Thank you.

            "article_content": "President Trump and lawmakers are set to release a plan for a tax overhaul Wednesday. Also, conservative Roy Moore, known for some extreme-right views, won a Senate primary election in Alabama.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Big news after an Alabama Senate primary - President Trump's candidate is out. The antiestablishment candidate, Roy Moore, is in. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Yeah, Trump and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell had campaigned right up until the last minute against Moore, but they couldn't seem to rally their supporters to their preferred candidate. Instead, voters heeded the call from figures like Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon. GREENE: All right, NPR's Debbie Elliott has followed Moore's political career and this campaign. She's on the line now from Orange Beach, Ala. Hey there, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So I mean, looking at this, it seems like Trump's base broke from the president and voted for Roy Moore, which suggests - I mean, could we say that Moore is sounding more Trumpian than Trump himself? ELLIOTT: Well, you could say. He definitely sounded Trumpian on the campaign trail. He ran this outsider campaign, promising at every turn to drain the D.C. swamp. We'd heard that before. GREENE: Sure. ELLIOTT: And even last night in his victory speech, he echoed Donald Trump on the campaign trail saying, together we can make America great. You know, Roy Moore was already a popular figure in Alabama, though, so there's that going on. He has broad support, particularly in rural areas. If you look at the numbers, that's where he was strongest. And he's, you know, controversial. He's known as the Ten Commandments judge. He's a religious conservative. He gained fame because he has been fighting his whole career for what he calls the public acknowledgement of God as the foundation of government. He was twice removed as Alabama chief justice for defying federal court orders, once for not taking down this giant, washing machine-sized monument of the Ten Commandments that he had put in the Alabama Judicial Building and then again, once he was re-elected to the office, when he told state judges that they were not bound by the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage ruling. GREENE: Well, so if you have people like Sarah Palin and people who worked for Trump - I mean, Steve Bannon, Sebastian Gorka - out there campaigning for Moore and this candidate wins - the president's candidate does not - who holds sway right now over the president's base? ELLIOTT: Well, I might say the base. You know, certainly voters here in Alabama do not like being pushed into anything by what they perceive as power brokers from Washington. Right? So the more the GOP establishment sunk money into fighting Roy Moore, the better he seemed to do here. And now, looking ahead to next year's Republican primaries, it seems like there's an insurgency afoot. Steve Bannon has been in Alabama this week with Moore, and he's pretty much declaring war on Mitch McConnell and the GOP establishment. He talked about it a little bit last night. At the same time last night from the president, we saw a tweet saying congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican primary win in Alabama. Luther Strange started way back and ran a good race. Roy, win. So - and then, later, he deleted all of his prior tweets that were supporting the appointed incumbent, Luther Strange. GREENE: The president deleted his tweets... ELLIOTT: He did. GREENE: ...Supporting the guy who lost? Wow. ELLIOTT: Yeah. So he is - he's all in for Roy Moore now and has somewhat erased his support from the past. GREENE: All right. And now we're all going to be watching as this traditionally conservative state will have the actual race between Roy Moore and a Democrat, Doug Jones. ELLIOTT: Right. And that's an uphill battle in Alabama. The state has not sent a Democrat to the U.S. Senate for about, you know, a quarter of a century now. KELLY: And this all raises the really interesting question of how all in President Trump and establishment Republicans are going to be for Roy Moore as he goes up against his Democratic challenger. GREENE: Yeah. And all these questions about the dynamic in the Republican Party... KELLY: Yeah. GREENE: ...Will continue. NPR's Debbie Elliott - thanks a lot, Deb. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, we're going to turn now to one of President Trump's big campaign promises, to help millions of middle-class Americans. This was the president speaking yesterday at the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will cut taxes tremendously for the middle class, not just a little bit but tremendously. KELLY: Well, today the president unveils his plan to overhaul the U.S. tax code. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: That includes nearly doubling the standard deduction that most families take on their taxes and increasing the child tax credit, which families really want and have been talking about it for a long time. KELLY: So that's what the president says he wants to happen with taxes. Meanwhile, David, he's also been talking about Puerto Rico and what role the federal government can and should be playing there in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Trump says he's going to go visit Puerto Rico next week. GREENE: All right we have NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith with us. Hey, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So I know we're all going to be bringing out the calculators as we see the details of this plan come out today. But can you just set up this moment for me? I mean, the president, Republicans - they suffer another defeat on health care. This is an important test for them. KEITH: It absolutely is. And a lot of Republicans say, well, health care was hard, but we can do taxes. Taxes will be easier. We're Republicans. We do taxes. But taxes are hard, too. GREENE: They're not easy. KEITH: Overhauling the tax code hasn't been done in 30 years, and there's a reason for that. So what we're hearing - and this has been the result of negotiations between top Republicans in the White House for months. And this rollout is something that they've been heading towards. The word is that the income tax rate would drop from - the top income tax rate would drop from about 39.6 percent to 35 percent. The corporate rate would fall from 35 percent to around 20 percent. There are a lot of details yet to be filled in that we aren't even expecting to get later today when we get some more details. And those details will really determine whether this is a middle-class tax cut, as the president has been promising, or whether it ends up primarily benefiting the wealthy. GREENE: OK, couple other big questions there to answer as we get this plan. Let me turn our attention to Puerto Rico. I mean, some of the reporting from there that we've heard, Tam - I mean, the devastation there is unimaginable. And the president now announcing he's going to visit next week. How has his response to this been perceived? KEITH: So over the weekend, the president took a lot of heat for tweeting more than 15 times about the NFL without a single mention of the people suffering in Puerto Rico. And this was a shift from previous hurricanes that hit the mainland U.S. that got a ton of Twitter attention from the president. His Twitter drought ended on Monday night. But Twitter affects perception. And real life is different, but Twitter affects perception. So FEMA has been on the ground; the U.S. military has been mobilized. More help is on the way. But seemingly sensing the narrative problem, the president made a big show yesterday of talking about Puerto Rico, bringing in the FEMA director, doing a video link with the Puerto Rican governor. But Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida, says the situation is dire and that there could be a real humanitarian crisis if more is not done quickly. KELLY: NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith - Tam, thanks. KEITH: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK. Now we turn to a breakthrough for women in Saudi Arabia. Yesterday, the kingdom announced they are ending a ban on women driving. Women's rights activists called this move amazing. KELLY: Madeha Al Ajroush is one of the women who spent decades protesting Saudi Arabia's ban on women driving. Here's how she described it to NPR back in 2011. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MADEHA AL AJROUSH: It's like a person being cut off - their legs are cut off, and the wheelchair has been taken away from them. And you're completely dependent on one gender. KELLY: Well, as of next summer, she will be able to drive without fear of reprisal. So this is a big deal for women in Saudi Arabia. And it is already prompting questions about some of the other changes that women have been pushing for there. GREENE: NPR's Deborah Amos covers the Middle East for NPR, and she has reported on efforts to lift this ban in Saudi Arabia. She joins us. Hey, Deb. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. GREENE: Seems like a very big deal - why is this happening now, at this moment? AMOS: It's a big deal. The young and powerful crown prince, the son of the king, he's been signaling this move for a while. Now, there's some irony in the announcement yesterday. It comes a week after a senior cleric said that women shouldn't drive because they have a quarter of the brain power of men. Nevertheless, the activists, some of them who went to jail to protest this ban, they have been euphoric on Twitter. And so they think that it's a big deal. GREENE: And the protests against this driving ban - I mean, they go back years. Right? AMOS: 1990. About 40 women dismissed their drivers and drove on the capital streets of Riyadh. I was in Saudi at the time. I was covering the first Gulf War. So you know, the place was packed with American soldiers. There were female soldiers. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the protest. But all of the - I didn't meet any of these protesters for 25 years. They lost their jobs. They couldn't travel outside the country. And there wasn't another protest till 2011. GREENE: That's extraordinary. What is the wider context, then, of this moment? I mean, the Saudi king has instituted this reform package that's known as 2030. How does this decision play into all of that? AMOS: You know, there's a lot of economics in this. First of all, there's 800,000 drivers for women. And this is a country that would like Saudis to have these jobs. You have women who are the majority of college graduates. They want to get them into the workplace. They need to get them into the workplace, and they have to be able to get there. Now, Uber has kind of changed the game a bit. People can just call up a car and get in it. But this is an economic measure as much as a social measure. GREENE: All right, NPR's Deborah Amos talking to us about the lifting of a driving ban on women in Saudi Arabia, a big moment in that country. Deb, thanks. AMOS: Thank you.

On Friday, Hillary Clinton addressed the graduating class of her alma mater, Wellesley College. She used the opportunity to wade into current politics and direct a few jokes at President Trump. \"When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\" she said. \"That is not hyperbole; it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done. ... They attempt to control reality.\" She called Trump's new budget proposal \"an attack of unimaginable cruelty on the most vulnerable among us \u2014 the youngest, the oldest, the poorest and hard-working people who need a little help to gain or hang on to a decent, middle-class life.\" \"Let's call it what it is, it's a con. They don't even try to hide it,\" she said, referring to the Trump administration. Clinton slammed President Trump's budget proposal and talked about her postelection life. She joked about her 1969 Wellesley class being furious after the election of Richard Nixon, saying the class was angered over \"a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.\" (Nixon actually resigned before the House could vote on his impeachment.) She continued, \"after firing the person running the investigation into him at the Department of Justice,\" an allusion to Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. \"We got through that tumultuous time, and once again, we began to thrive,\" she said. Clinton also spoke about fake news and theories perpetuated on social media, joking that \"some are even denying things we see with our own eyes, like the size of crowds.\" Clinton talked about her November loss. \"You may have heard that things didn't go exactly as I planned. But you know what, I'm doing OK,\" she said. She talked about spending time with her family after the election, walking in the woods and organizing her closets and added, \"I won't lie, chardonnay helped a little too.\" But what helped her most, she said, was \"remembering who I am, where I come from and what I believe.\" \"Don't be afraid of your ambition, of your dreams or even your anger,\" she continued. \"Those are powerful forces, but harness them to make a difference in the world.\" The Wellesley stage is a familiar one for her \u2014 Clinton delivered the commencement address as a student and again 25 years ago. Clinton has made few public appearances since last November's crushing loss, mostly addressing groups that advocate for women and children. She has also been seen hiking, shopping at bookstores and doing other regular people things in her \"peaceful alternate universe,\" as the Huffington Post described it. The young activist was the first student to address the graduating class, and she used that speech to lean into politics of the day. She challenged Sen. Edward Brooke, who spoke at the same event. He celebrated incremental progress and argued against protest, as NPR's Tamara Keith reported. When it was Clinton's turn, she ad-libbed a response to Brooke, declaring that empathy was not enough in politics. \"Part of the problem with just empathy with professed goals is that empathy doesn't do us anything,\" she said. \"We've had lots of empathy, we've had lots of sympathy, but we feel that for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible.\" \"The challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible,\" she continued. Earlier this week, Clinton made similar comments blasting Trump's budget saying that it, along with efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, \"shows an unimaginable level of cruelty and lack of imagination and disdain for the struggles of millions of Americans.\"",

As Iranian voters prepare to head to the polls Friday, there's one thing the high-stakes presidential election certainly will not decide: the country's commander in chief. That post, at least, is already filled by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader for nearly three decades. As long as he maintains control over the highest seat in the land, Khamenei enjoys wide-ranging authority over the security forces and effective veto power over matters both diplomatic and domestic \u2014 including the council that vets and approves presidential candidates. Still, the presidency offers significant power of its own. Whichever candidate emerges with the electoral victory will be handed a four-year term and the helm of an economy at a crossroads. The approaching election presents a stark choice for Iranians: Re-elect the moderate incumbent, President Hassan Rouhani, or reject his relatively open-facing policies and turn to the conservative hard-liners hoping to replace him, such as his biggest challenger, Ibrahim Raisi. Here is what's at stake in Iran on Friday \u2014 from the big names to the way they'll be selected \u2014 and what it means for the rest of the world. Who are the candidates?How will Iran decide?What does this mean for the West? Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks to supporters Wednesday at his rally in Ardabil, Iran.\n                \n                    \n                    Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks to supporters Wednesday at his rally in Ardabil, Iran. President Hassan Rouhani has been in power since 2013, when he surprised many observers with a commanding electoral victory. Described at the time as \"the lone voice of moderation\" among the candidates, Rouhani largely confirmed that reputation during his tenure \u2014 supporting freer Internet access and holding ground-breaking, regular face-to-face talks with the U.S. about Iran's nuclear program. Those talks resulted in a landmark 2015 agreement that allowed inspectors into Iran's nuclear facilities and promised to limit its nuclear program to peaceful purposes. In return, Iran saw some of the sanctions it had been slapped with lifted. The deal has become the signature achievement of Rouhani's term in office and the centerpiece of his current presidential campaign \u2014 for better and for worse. (For more on what the election could spell for the nuclear deal in the U.S., click here or scroll below.) Yet the agreement has delivered mixed results for the Iranian economy. Although the country has attracted big international deals \u2014 such as a purchase of Boeing airplanes \u2014 the benefits have been slow to trickle down to average Iranians. \"A lot of middle-class people here are struggling to make ends meet,\" NPR's Steve Inskeep reports from the capital, Tehran. \"And many of them are frustrated.\" Ebrahim Raisi's supporters loft national flags and his portrait during a campaign rally at Imam Khomeini Mosque in Tehran on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ebrahim Raisi's supporters loft national flags and his portrait during a campaign rally at Imam Khomeini Mosque in Tehran on Tuesday. Rouhani blames hard-liners for trying to sabotage the agreement and its benefits, but many of those frustrated voters aren't convinced. They're turning instead to Rouhani's hard-line challengers, most notably Ebrahim Raisi. A conservative cleric, Raisi hews closely to Khamenei's policy line \u2014 so much so, in fact, he's occasionally mentioned as the supreme leader's possible successor. Currently, he helms the charitable foundation for the Imam Reza shrine, one of the focal points of the Shiite world. But many of his detractors look to Raisi's past for perhaps his single most disqualifying factor: his alleged involvement in a committee that decided the fate of thousands of political prisoners who disappeared in the late 1980s. \"They executed more than 3,000 political prisoners,\" Iranian journalist Behdad Bordbar tells NPR's Peter Kenyon. The golden dome and minaret of the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad, Iran, as seen in 2008.\n                \n                    \n                    Hasan Sarbakhshian/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Members of that committee have never faced charges for their role in the presumed killings \u2014 but human rights activists aren't prepared to forget. \"A man who should be on trial for the most heinous crime in contemporary Iranian history, is instead seeking the presidency,\" said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, said in a statement last month. \"Allowing him to run for president is yet another grievous wound for the families who unjustly lost their loved ones in 1988.\" Yet Raisi's electoral position was buttressed this week, as one of his rivals \u2014 Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, another hard-liner \u2014 dropped out of the race and endorsed him. The pair, who accuse Rouhani of anemic economic progress and weakness in negotiations with the West, even campaigned together on Tuesday. Rouhani, for his part, recently received the backing of another dropout, reformist candidate Eshaq Jahangiri. Mostafa Hashemitaba, also a reformer, and conservative Mostafa Mirsalim round out the list of six presidential candidates approved by the Guardian Council, a 12-seat, appointed panel dominated by conservative, religious members. Hashemitaba and Mirsalim qualified for the group of finalists \u2014 beating out more than 1,600 others who put their names forward, according to NBC \u2014 but neither has appeared to approach the same level of popularity as the two main contenders. In fact, Hashemitaba has been openly calling for his supporters to vote for Rouhani, and Mirsalim has endorsed Raisi. Then again, Iran's elections are often unpredictable (as the section directly below demonstrates), and unofficial polls reflect a race this year that's likely to be no different. A woman in Tehran stands in front of a wall plastered with posters of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, whose re-election bid will have its decisive moment Friday \u2014 unless, of course, the voting results in a runoff.\n                \n                    \n                    Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A woman in Tehran stands in front of a wall plastered with posters of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, whose re-election bid will have its decisive moment Friday \u2014 unless, of course, the voting results in a runoff. Voters head to the polls Friday, though if past elections are any indication, it's unlikely we'll know the results before Saturday. Even then, those results might be less than decisive: By Iran's electoral rules, a candidate must earn more than 50 percent of the vote to seal a win in the first round. Otherwise, the top two candidates from the first vote will take part in a runoff one week later, set for May 26. Iran's leaders are bullish about prospective turnout, with the country's interior minister predicting that more than 70 percent \u2014 or some 56.4 million people \u2014 will vote, according to The Associated Press. \"Historically,\" the news service notes, \"the more Iranians who cast ballots, the greater the chance a reformist or a moderate like Rouhani will be elected.\" But Iranian elections are famous for their surprising results. Not only did Rouhani's victory come as a shock to some, the 1997 election of reformer Mohammad Khatami defied many predictions, as well. But by 2005, voters had grown so dissatisfied with Khatami's perceived failure to deliver on his promises that they surprised observers again \u2014 electing a then-relative unknown in hard-line conservative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In 2009, even the final official results didn't spell an end to that year's election, which turned into a full-blown crisis and crackdown after Ahmadinejad won again. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians marched and protested, claiming the vote was rigged \u2014 but security forces eventually crushed the demonstrations, known as the Green Movement, with waves of arrests of protesters and prominent political figures. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addresses a crowd in Takhti Stadium in Mashhad, Iran, on Wednesday. Rouhani took power in 2013, surprising many observers with a convincing victory in the first round of voting.\n                \n                    \n                    Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addresses a crowd in Takhti Stadium in Mashhad, Iran, on Wednesday. Rouhani took power in 2013, surprising many observers with a convincing victory in the first round of voting. With the Middle East in turmoil and traditional alliances in question, the decision Iranians make on Friday could have an impact well beyond their country's borders. Iran's current theocracy, which was born in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, often backs militants around the Middle East \u2014 from the Lebanon-based Shiite group Hezbollah to Yemeni rebels. Its clerical leadership has threatened Israel's existence and demonized the U.S. And Iran's supreme leader is well aware that his country's election has captured the world's attention. \"From the U.S. state apparatuses to European powers and regional countries aligned with America, to the pathetic prime minister of the Zionist regime, all are closely watching [the vote] and how and in what spirit\" the Iranians will vote, Khamenei said in a televised speech Wednesday, according to the AP. While Khamenei controls Iran's foreign policy, the president can help sculpt broader global opinion about the country's actions on the world stage. That includes the U.S., where Iran-watchers \u2014 including members of Congress \u2014 are sharply split over how to deal with the country. Although Rouhani won the backing of the ayatollah on the deal to limit Iran's nuclear program, hard-liners in the U.S. tend to distrust Rouhani as the deceptively friendly face of a rogue nation. Others have been won over by Rouhani's willingness to talk to the West, believing Iran might slowly become more moderate if the U.S. and European powers engage with the country economically. For now, President Trump's administration has said it will continue to uphold its end of the nuclear bargain, announcing Wednesday that it would continue to waive some sanctions on Iran despite having referred to the deal on the campaign trail as the \"worst deal ever.\" Should Raisi win, however, hawks in the West are likely to increase their calls for tighter sanctions until Iran ends its support for militant groups and its longtime enmity toward Israel. Ultimately though, the Trump administration and Congress appear eager to revise former President Barack Obama's policies toward Iran. That might spell tighter U.S. sanctions either way \u2014 in which case, the other signatories on the nuclear, which range from Russia to the U.K., would soon face a decision of their own: Follow the U.S., or continue to work with the man Iranians choose Friday.",

            "article_content": "We explore Iran's burgeoning tech scene and what it means for President Hassan Rouhani's prospects for winning a second term.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Iran decides this week if it wants to change course. The president there is up for re-election. Hasan Rouhani is not the top official in a government dominated by clerics. He is the man, though, who won a surprise victory in 2013 and cut a nuclear deal with the West. Our co-host Steve Inskeep is in Tehran asking how much Rouhani has changed the country at this point. Hi, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Hey there, Rachel. Wish you were here. MARTIN: Yeah, likewise. Lots of change happening in Iran, and it's not so easy to measure change. So how are you figuring it out? INSKEEP: Well, it's not a fully free society, but you can read little signs, which we have seen from the moment the plane touched down the other day. It was the middle of the night. We had American cell phones in our hands, which have never worked in past years in Iran. But this time, here's the experience I had with our producer Kevin Leahy. And we've got service. KEVIN LEAHY, BYLINE: It says AT&T. INSKEEP: It's AT&T. And here's a note from our driver, who's waiting for us outside the airport. Got to tell you, Rachel - this one little thing makes a country seem a lot less forbidding. And it turned out to be symbolic because Iran's president has been trying to open up the information economy a little bit. MARTIN: Open up the information economy. So that seems to get at a contradiction because more internet can mean more business and more income. At the same time, it also means more freedom of expression and less control by the government. No? INSKEEP: And the governing establishment here - you know, the clerics and the ayatollah who hold supreme power - would like more of the one thing without so much of the other. And that's the tension we felt as we drove around Tehran. You look up, and this city seems timeless, by the way. You see snow-covered mountains at the ends of the streets. And then you look down, and everything seems to be churning, changing, like the internet startup business run by Tabassom Latifi. Whose idea was this? TABASSOM LATIFI: Me. INSKEEP: She's 31 years old. She's a college graduate. And this was her idea, getting housewives to cook lunch for people at work. LATIFI: We are actually connecting two groups of people to each other. The first group are housewives who are very good at cooking. They like it. They like to contribute to their family economy. And also, they wanted to expose their art, you know, to others. MARTIN: Their art. INSKEEP: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) INSKEEP: That's one group. And the other group that she wants to connect is people at work who wish, well, Mom still made their lunch. And now they can order it on a website. The company is called Mamanpaz. Maman means mom. And we met some moms who cook in their homes, one of whom, by the way, made a Persian dish called bagala polo, which is beans and rice and chicken, enough to load up two dozen lunch containers. (CROSSTALK) INSKEEP: Business is growing even though it does depend on the internet, which is a little different in Iran. For example, if you want to spread word about your products on social media, you have to pick channels that the government doesn't block. LATIFI: It's very important for us. INSKEEP: So Instagram is ok. Telegram is OK. Facebook is... LATIFI: Facebook is not OK. INSKEEP: And Twitter... LATIFI: Twitter is not OK too. INSKEEP: Internet restrictions have not really ended under President Rouhani, although the government is trying to encourage tech firms like this. Latifi says young people in what are called knowledge jobs, like at internet companies, have a chance to be excused from military service. Do you think the country is moving in the right direction? LATIFI: Yes but slowly, very slowly. It's also dependent on the next election (laughter) - of course. MARTIN: The next election, which is happening this Friday, right? So how are Rouhani's prospects looking? INSKEEP: Well, he's favored over some more conservative opponents. But as we visited these Mamanpaz cooks, we got a sense of the pressures on the president because the next woman we'll meet is Manijeh Farajbakht. She led us into a lovely living room with hardwood chairs and knickknacks on the wall. How did you hear about Mamanpaz? LATIFI: (Speaking Farsi). MANIJEH FARAJBAKHT: (Speaking Farsi). INSKEEP: And listen to her story. She said she was looking for a job for her husband who's retired. Inflation in Iran eroded their retirement savings, and he needed to work again. And she ended up discovering a job for herself at Mamanpaz. For a while, she made dozens of lunches per day, cooking on a stove on her roof, which of course we had to see. Lovely morning to be on the roof. But the stove was not in use. The cook told us she's not making enough money. The ingredients keep costing more, and she stopped cooking, Rachel, until she gets a raise, which is symbolic here because a lot of middle-class people are struggling to make ends meet. And many of them are frustrated, even though President Rouhani did the nuclear deal and got some sanctions lifted on this country. So you end up with Rouhani supporters, like Manijeh's husband, Abbas Ghaemi, who - well, just listen to his answer when I asked if he likes Rouhani. Rouhani, doost dari? ABBAS GHAEMI: (Through interpreter) His ideas are better. He's better than the others actually. INSKEEP: OK. Will you vote for him then? UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER: (Speaking Farsi). GHAEMI: (Through interpreter) I think. UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER: Yes. INSKEEP: You think. MARTIN: So Steve, clearly, there's less enthusiasm for Rouhani than there was years ago - when he was elected four years ago. Is it really fair, though, to say Rouhani hasn't done much about the Iranian economy? INSKEEP: Well, he has done something about the internet economy. His government has supported a lot more 3G and 4G service, high-speed cellphone service, which has increased the space for commerce and also, by the way, the space for political debate online. MARTIN: So taken as a whole, what does this internet economy say about the re-election prospects of Iran's president? INSKEEP: You know, can I answer that by taking you for a ride on Iran's version of Uber, Rachel... MARTIN: By all means, yeah. INSKEEP: ...You know, the ride-sharing service where you summon a car with your smartphone, which we did. And our driver pulled up. We got in and talked on the way to the destination. He's a student, and he's 20 years old. How does it affect you to spend six or seven hours a day in Tehran traffic? KOUROSH QADIRI: (Through interpreter) I try not to really get into traffic jam... INSKEEP: Although... QADIRI: ...Or really crowded. INSKEEP: ...We're in one now actually. To be clear, Rachel, you're pretty much always in a traffic jam in Tehran, and we were in one with Kourosh Qadiri, the driver, who seems to fall into President Rouhani's target demographic. He's a student. He's in the internet economy. He's going to be voting in his first presidential election, but he's not voting for President Rouhani - doesn't like the nuclear deal and believes Iran's supreme leader would like him to vote for a more conservative candidate. This is not a fully free or transparent election, but it is a moment for Iran to choose. MARTIN: Our MORNING EDITION co-host Steve Inskeep - he is reporting from Iran all this week. National elections there will take place this Friday. Hey, Steve, thanks so much. We'll talk to you again. INSKEEP: OK, Rachel. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "French presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon delivers a speech during a meeting in Lille, northern France, on April 12.\n                \n                    \n                    Michel Spingler/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption French presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon delivers a speech during a meeting in Lille, northern France, on April 12. Jean-Luc Melenchon likes surprising even his own supporters. Last week, thousands waited to hear the 65-year-old, brash, charismatic leftist speak inside the Grand Palais in the northern French city of Lille. But first he dashed outside to a balcony overlooking an overflow crowd huddled around a giant TV screen. \"I didn't want to go inside without greeting you!\" Melenchon, clad in a navy-blue utility jacket, declared, as his supporters cheered and chanted \"Resistance!\" \"It's the people who make history \u2014 it's you!\" he said. \"It's the first time I can listen to a politician without getting bored,\" said 30-year-old Joanna Estime, who spent years ignoring French politics but now campaigns for Melenchon. A couple of months ago, Melenchon, whose party is called La France Insoumise (\"Untamed France\"), did not seem like a serious contender for president. But the \"French Bernie Sanders,\" as he's sometimes been called, is shaking up the French presidential election with his promises to stand up for the little guy. He's surging in the polls just a week before the first round of voting \u2014 running even or just ahead of Francois Fillon, the conservative candidate who has been hurt by a corruption scandal. Supporters of hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon listen to his speech at the Grand Palais in the northern French city of Lille.\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon listen to his speech at the Grand Palais in the northern French city of Lille. \"Why Melenchon? Because he's a very good candidate,\" says Pierre Mathiot, a political science professor at Sciences Po Lille. Mathiot says Melenchon has won over voters who are angry with a political system that they believe has fueled economic inequality. They like Melenchon's power-to-the-people campaign messages and honest, funny debate performances \u2014 even if his ideas are extreme. He wants to renegotiate European Union treaties and withdraw France from institutions such as NATO and the International Monetary Fund, which he associates with globalized capitalism. \"For a lot of voters, he is the only leftist candidate,\" Mathiot says, since the Socialists have imploded after Francois Hollande's unpopular presidency. Melenchon has reached out to young voters in non-traditional ways. There's a video game called Fiscal Kombat, which features an animated Melenchon literally shaking money out of rich political figures such as former President Nicolas Sarkozy and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. And Melenchon kicked off his campaign in February by appearing in two places at once \u2014 in the flesh in Lyon, and as a 3-D hologram more than 300 miles away \u2014 in Paris. He repeated the hologram effect again in Lille, transporting himself to six more locations, including Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. It's a hit, so he's planning to do it again this week. \"He's a politician since the '80s,\" Mathiot says. \"So he's a very old politician, but he's very modern in his political way of life. So it's not a question of age, of political experience. For lots of voters, and especially young voters, he's a new politician.\" Antoine Villemin, a 20-year-old marketing student from Lille, says he's among the 30 percent of French voters who are still undecided. He says he enjoys Melenchon's holograms and witty campaign videos on YouTube. \"But what I like in Jean-Luc Melenchon is that his speech is the same for almost 20 years now,\" he says. Villemin says he especially likes that Melenchon has promised to relieve tax burdens on France's beleaguered middle class and hike taxes on the super-rich. \"We're going to create tax tiers,\" Melenchon told supporters in Lille. \"And at the top, they're going to pay a lot! Why are they going to pay a lot? Because they have a lot!\" It's a message that's also resonated in Faches-Thumesnil, a depressed suburb of Lille where the unemployment rate is 14 percent, four times higher than the national average. It was once a stronghold of France's Socialists. But voters like Malika Allamaachaoui have switched to Melenchon. \"I'm done with the Socialists,\" says Allamaachaoui, a 48-year-old French-Moroccan mother of five. \"My mom only has a small pension. She barely gets by. If we don't do something, it's going to be the same for our children.\" I meet Allamaachaoui as she's stocking up on rice and canned tomatoes at a \"social supermarket,\" a grocery for those who make less than 10 euros a day and where items are discounted by up to 90 percent. It serves about 1,500 people, says Emilie Morell, the supermarket's accountant. But Melenchon hasn't managed to sway everyone here. Laura Terrier, a 35-year-old assistant for developmentally disabled children, is a longtime leftist voter who now finds herself struggling to choose a candidate. As she stands in line at the checkout line, she tells me that she likes Melenchon's ideas but she's also been swayed by far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. \"I will not vote for Le Pen because of the racism,\" Terriers says. \"But it is the only thing that keeps me from voting for her.\" Public opinion polls show that the two top finishers on April 23 will likely be Le Pen and centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister in Hollande's government. Aurelien Bouchez, a 23-year-old who works in retail, says he cannot support Le Pen or Macron. He has not given up hope that Melenchon will make the May 7 run-off. \"I like the idea of a big change, a complete change,\" he says. \"Because even though I'm young, I've studied history, I see what's happened before and where it's gotten us.\"",

            "article_content": "For the past five weeks, millions of Indians have been voting in state elections. The contests have implications for the national elections two years from now.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: In, India millions of people have been going to the polls for the past five weeks. That's right - five weeks. This is a massive electoral exercise there. Now, these are not national elections. They're just in a handful of states. But let's hear why there's a lot on the line for India's leader. NPR's Julie McCarthy is in New Delhi. Julie, good morning. JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: Well, it sounds like a part of the story that you're covering here is really the electoral process itself. Am I right that one state is holding seven different stages of voting? MCCARTHY: Well, that's right. I think oftentimes we gloss over the scale of India 'cause it's easy to do. But here's some perspective, David. The combined population of the five states who are voting is 246 million people. That's three quarters of the population of the United States. GREENE: That's amazing. MCCARTHY: Yeah. And the biggest of these states sits right next door. That's Uttar Pradesh. That's the one you're referring to with its 200 million people. The voting is staggered in seven phases. And the final phase of voting ends today, at the sort of classic Indian clash campaign, which is to say lots of mudslinging and personality-driven politics. GREENE: All right. Well, somewhere hidden in the mud, there must be some actual issues here. MCCARTHY: (Laughter) Yes. And one of the big ones, I would say the main one going into it, was Prime Minister Narendra Modi's controversial currency swap. You might remember last November, he pulled all the high-value notes out of circulation in India, which pulled most of the cash out of the economy. But Modi cleverly cast this exercise as a crackdown on corrupt rich people who had stashed cash and didn't report it to the tax man. And he struck a deep chord. The struggling middle class and India's masses of poor applauded. They are sick of corruption and sick of what they perceive as the rich getting away with things. And with the passage of time, money has returned to circulation. And voters may have forgotten how painful it was. But this currency gamble made these state contests a referendum on Modi. GREENE: Modi, who I guess is hoping that Indians do forget the pain from that whole currency crisis. So, I mean, is that issue really alone defining him? MCCARTHY: No. You know, here's a guy who's tried to make himself the face of local aspirations. And what do we mean by that? It's development. Uttar Pradesh lacks electricity, jobs, schools. But the young Turks who are in the opposition say, wait a minute. Modi hasn't delivered as prime minister on jobs. And they paint his campaigning, his kind of hectic campaigning as a desperate ploy for votes. So you get this tit-for-tat in this campaign. And most rallies really avoided serious issues like caste and the discrimination that comes with caste. The parties did raise violence against women. But they sparred over how bad it was. And three of these five states are in northern India, David, where there's some of the most polluted air in the world and virtually nothing is said about it. GREENE: Julie, this is a huge country, huge economy. The United States, other countries pay a lot of attention to what happens here. I mean, if Modi loses these state elections, his party at least, is it a huge setback? MCCARTHY: Well, the economy is growing at a clip. But the distribution of wealth is uneven. There's a lot of people without jobs. However, foreign money is coming back. The stock market is roaring. So there's general optimism. And Modi's party could benefit. But if Modi doesn't do well in these elections, it could cast a shadow over his fundamental project, which is Make in India, calls for foreign investors to come in and manufacture here. Important reforms like taxes could stall. And it could also deepen uncertainty about the U.S.-India relationship with the new Trump administration. So there's a lot riding on these elections. GREENE: OK. Speaking to NPR's Julie McCarthy in New Delhi. Julie, thanks so much, as always. MCCARTHY: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF ROY HARGROVE'S \"I'M NOT SO SURE\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

            "article_content": "A suicide attack in the Afghan capital Kabul killed dozens. Republican Roy Moore went to court to try to stop Alabama from certifying Democrat Doug Jones as the winner of the vacant Senate seat.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: And we are watching the death toll rise after a vicious attack this morning in the capital of Afghanistan. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE GROANING) NOEL KING, HOST: Those are the sounds of anguish in Kabul. A suicide bomber detonated explosives at the gate of a building that housed a Shiite cultural center and an Iranian-owned news agency. An interior ministry official says dozens of people were killed and wounded, including women and children. GREENE: NPR's Diaa Hadid is in Islamabad covering this. Hi, Diaa. DIAA HADID, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning. GREENE: Good morning. So it sounds like this is becoming maybe deadlier than we first thought, as we're learning more here. HADID: Right. The death toll does seem to be rising. You know, a local TV station, TOLO, put a live feed outside the hospital where many of the casualties were arriving. And you can see dozens of people milling around and cars arriving with more and more people. So far, local media say more than 40 people were killed. GREENE: OK. And as Noel mentioned, it sounds like maybe the target here - Shiites and Iran. HADID: Yeah. So I spoke to Aziz Tosol (ph) - he's a local journalist in Kabul. And he says that the news agency is Iranian owned and the Tebyan cultural center is a Shiite organization. And so that suggests that, yes, they were the targets. But the victims could have been from anywhere. Local media reported that most people killed in this blast were attending a panel discussion in the basement of the Shiite cultural center. And on Twitter today, two - a local journalist put up two images of people identified as being killed. One was a journalist. Another was a young man who had just graduated from university. GREENE: So has anyone claimed responsibility for doing this? HADID: No, not so far. The Taliban in fact denied that they were responsible for this attack. But the fact that it seemed to be targeting Shiites suggests that the Islamic State may have been behind it. Since they emerged in Afghanistan two years ago, they have relentlessly targeted Shiites, mostly in mosques. And this might represent a widening of their targets. GREENE: And this has been a very complicated problem for the world to be dealing with at this moment - Afghanistan. Right? HADID: Yeah, yeah. And so even though, like, the U.N. immediately denounced these attacks. The Afghan president's office did as well, and so did NATO. But no matter how much they condemn them, many residents in Kabul feel that the Western-backed government can't protect them. And that's not just a human tragedy, that's an enormous political problem because it erodes the very legitimacy of this government at a time when it really needs to claim that. GREENE: Which has been the argument of the U.S. and Western powers all along - that if they can prop up the Afghan government enough to take care and secure its own country, that that's the way they hope this will go. And this seems to be undermining that potentially. HADID: It completely undermines it. And what I've found (ph) - the - everyone seems to be grappling with this problem of how to quell the rise of the Islamic State in Afghanistan. It's been done in the Middle East but at an enormous cost. The question is now, like, what will it take to put out the Islamic State in Afghanistan? GREENE: NPR's Diaa Hadid speaking to us from Islamabad. Thanks so much, Diaa. HADID: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: And in Alabama, Roy Moore is back in the news. He is now going to court. KING: That's right, David. He's trying to stop Alabama from certifying Democrat Doug Jones as the winner of the state's vacant Senate seat. Now, Moore filed a lawsuit last night. That's just a couple hours ahead of a meeting today that was supposed to certify the results. Jones, of course, won by about 20,000 votes. But it seems Moore will not concede. Here's Moore speaking on the night of the special election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROY MOORE: That's what we've got to do, is wait on God and let this process play out. I know it's late, but the votes are still coming in. And we're looking at that. GREENE: We have Scott Detrow here. He's host of the NPR Politics podcast. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Morning, David. GREENE: So it sounds like Moore is not necessarily waiting on God and letting this process play out. He's doing something. He's going to court. What exactly is he arguing? DETROW: So he's alleging voter fraud, voting irregularities. There's not much specific evidence - we should say - in this suit. One of the things that Moore cites is that there was higher turnout than expected. Well, given all the attention paid to this race, I think there's... GREENE: Yeah, there was... DETROW: ...A lot of reasons there was high turnout. GREENE: ...A lot of massive implications, people thought. DETROW: Yeah. And Jones defeated Moore by about 1.5 percent on election night. Absentee ballots have not really changed that. As you said, it's about a 20,000-vote lead right now. GREENE: So is this that surprising after he refused to concede that night? I mean, we sort of thought he was going to keep this going in some way. DETROW: Not really. Look at Moore's entire career. He was booted out of office twice, continues to comeback, continues to keep running for other offices. He's really by himself here. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill is a Republican. He told the Associated Press last night he's seen no evidence of fraud. He said the lawsuit is not going to delay certification. And Doug Jones will be certified today at 1 p.m., and he will be sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence. GREENE: And that was a Republican saying that... DETROW: Yeah. GREENE: ...That he's not going to let this process do that much. OK. So if Jones is sworn in, as we expect, does this change the dynamics of the GOP agenda next year, now that you have this seat turning to the Democrats? DETROW: I think it does. I can't think of anything I've said more on Up First this year than, Republicans can only lose two votes, David, and still pass this bill. GREENE: I have heard this before. That's right. DETROW: We could just do it on repeat. GREENE: Yeah. DETROW: But now it's only one vote. So think about this - Mike Pence has already cast six tiebreaking votes in the Senate in his first year of office. He could make John C. Calhoun nervous. He's the vice president who holds the record for the most tiebreaking votes, at 31. But that's everything from Betsy DeVos' confirmation to scaling back consumer financial protection bureau regulations to making it easier for states to block Planned Parenthood funding. All of those votes are things that would have failed with just one vote different in the Senate. And that's what we're going to have next year. President Trump and other Republican leaders talking about big controversial things like changing - scaling back entitlements like Medicare - very hard to do with just a one-vote margin. GREENE: So the calendar is turning to 2018. Are we just going to go right into political mode and the campaigning and the midterms will start? DETROW: I mean, that's my plan. I don't know what your plan is. (LAUGHTER) DETROW: Yeah. I mean, the question is - is a Democrat winning in Alabama just a fluke of circumstances of Roy Moore, or is that a sign of much bigger things to come for Democrats next year? GREENE: All right, NPR's Scott Detrow, who hosts the NPR Politics podcast. GREENE: Thanks, Scott. DETROW: Thank you, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: Let's talk politics in Russia now. Nobody is doubting that President Vladimir Putin will win another term in the country's upcoming presidential election. KING: Despite that, one man keeps trying to upset Putin's plans to stay in power. That's opposition leader Alexei Navalny. On Monday, Navalny's registration to run for president was denied. And now his latest YouTube video appears to be blocked. GREENE: All right, NPR Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim is with us. Hi, Lucian. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: All right. So Alexei Navalny - for people who don't know - who is he? And is he a legitimate threat to Vladimir Putin? KIM: Well, Alexei Navalny is a lawyer and an anti-corruption activist. And what's interesting about him is he probably wouldn't exist without the Internet. He has really successfully harnessed the Internet to bypass state media. Now he has several YouTube channels, and he has used them very effectively to talk to his supporters, to build a nationwide campaign network and also to collect donations. Now as to the question if he's a threat, even independent opinion polls give him a pretty low ranking. One recent poll showed that 60 percent of Russians trust Putin, and only 2 percent say that about Navalny. And just, you know, anecdotally, I've met young Russians who haven't even heard of him and others, even who are quite liberal in their views, say they would never vote for him. I think the reason is because - not necessarily because they love Putin but because they really are afraid of whatever comes after him. GREENE: Well, is the Kremlin worried at all about Navalny? And I guess another part of that question is - if they're not worried and if they look at these poll numbers and a lot of Russians don't know Navalny and don't seem to like him all that much on a big scale - why not just let him run? Couldn't this backfire if they kick him out of the race and let him draw more attention? KIM: Well (laughter) - as always, it's really hard to know what they're thinking in the Kremlin. What's interesting is they actually did let Navalny run for Moscow mayor back in 2013. And he surprised everyone by getting almost a third of the vote. The system here in Russia is called managed democracy. And Navalny is definitely not manageable. So you know, if they let him run, they allow a certain element of unpredictability. And they also give him some legitimacy as a real politician. So I think in the Kremlin, they'd prefer to have an election without any serious challengers. GREENE: OK. So as you said, his real political power is through social media. What has happened to this YouTube video? KIM: Well, as you mentioned - I mean, he's been denied registration because of a conviction, which Navalny says is trumped up. And yesterday, he put out a YouTube video. I think we have some of that. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO) ALEXEI NAVALNY: (Speaking Russian). KIM: So what he's saying is that everyone who believes he should be allowed to run should boycott the March election and attend nationwide rallies on January 28. Now, interestingly enough, this YouTube video is unavailable. And we're still not exactly sure why, on whose initiative. But Navalny, true to form, has already defiantly tweeted. He tweeted - the video is blocked, but you know what to do. So yeah, it looks like he's really heading for a clash with the authorities in the coming year. GREENE: And he has brought out protests in pretty sizable numbers before. Right? I mean, they haven't been insignificant. KIM: Exactly. And this is sort of - there's a certain allergy in the Kremlin to these street protests. Putin himself has said, I'm ready for constructive opposition that comes up with a constructive program, but I don't like people going out and shouting on the streets. GREENE: NPR's Lucian Kim in Moscow this morning - Lucian, thanks. KIM: Great talking to you. (SOUNDBITE OF DEEB'S \"ROOFTOPS\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Alex Azar, who was deputy secretary for Health and Human Services in the George W. Bush administration, is President Trump's pick to replace Dr. Tom Price as head of the department.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alex Azar, who was deputy secretary for Health and Human Services in the George W. Bush administration, is President Trump's pick to replace Dr. Tom Price as head of the department. Updated at 1:48 p.m. ET President Trump is nominating a former pharmaceutical executive to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that, among other things, regulates prescription drugs. The nomination comes at a time when rising drug prices have become a hot political issue. Happy to announce, I am nominating Alex Azar to be the next HHS Secretary. He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices! On Twitter on Monday, Trump announced the nomination of Alex Azar, who until January had served as president of the U.S. arm of Eli Lilly & Co., based in Indianapolis. He said Azar, whose own Twitter feed is private, would be \"a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices.\" Azar, who served as deputy HHS secretary under President George W. Bush, is known as a detail-oriented bureaucrat who understands how to work the regulatory system to get things done. \"He's precise, highly motivated, he has high standards for performance for himself and for other people,\" said Mike Leavitt, who was HHS secretary when Azar was deputy. \"He had full responsibility as deputy secretary for the regulatory processes at HHS.\" Leavitt says Azar is likely to use that knowledge to alter the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, to make it more friendly to Republican ideals. Azar, he says, can work to \"change the ideology under which the existing law is implemented.\" \"That's the place where they have essential unilateral authority, if they follow the administrative rules act,\" Leavitt told Shots. \"Alex understands that process better than almost anybody and that undoubtedly had some bearing on the president's decision to appoint him.\" Azar also favors moving authority to the states over Medicaid, the program that provides health care to the poor, elderly and disabled. That means turning over the program to the states to make them \"better stewards of the money,\" he said in an interview at a February conference on YouTube. \"It turns these sovereign states and governors from supplicants to the HHS secretary into people running their own health insurance system for the poor.\" He said at the time that HHS could use its regulatory powers to allow states to customize the rules around Medicaid. Seema Verma, who runs the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and would work for Azar if he's confirmed, has said she, too, favors giving states waivers to create their own Medicaid systems. Where Azar stands on drug prices is less clear. President Trump said after his election and before his inauguration that he wants the government to work to lower drug prices and that he wants the Medicare program to use its buying power to negotiate better prices. Since then, the president hasn't said much specifically on the subject. But he did mention it when he announced his intention to nominate Azar on Twitter. Azar spent five years at Lilly, which makes several blockbuster medications, including Cialis, which treats erectile dysfunction; the antidepressant Cymbalta; and several forms of insulin. Insulin prices have drawn particular fire because they keep spiraling higher, even though insulin has been around almost a century. The prices of Lilly's insulin drugs Humalog and Humulin, for instance, have both risen about 225 percent since 2011, according to data from the investment research firm Bernstein. \"Drug corporations have undue influence over health policy in America, and they use it to make money on the backs of patients and taxpayers,\" said Ben Wakana, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group. Still, Wakana says Azar has a good track record. \"Mr. Azar is well-qualified and has the chance to stand up for patients because he knows exactly how our drug pricing system is broken. If he wants to take meaningful action to lower drug prices, we want to help him.\" While Azar was at Lilly, he also sat on the board of directors of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a trade group for biotech companies. Previously, Azar served as general counsel and later as deputy secretary of Health and Human Services during the George W. Bush administration. If he's confirmed, Azar would replace Dr. Tom Price, who resigned from HHS in September after a Politico investigation found that he had taken private charter aircraft on work-related trips at times when cheaper commercial flights were available. Azar, a lawyer, would take over one of the largest federal agencies with an annual budget of more than $1 trillion.

As the administration and Republicans in Congress look to scale back Medicaid, many voters and state lawmakers across the country are moving to make it bigger. On Tuesday, Maine voters approved a ballot measure to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Advocates are looking to follow suit with ballot measures in Utah, Missouri and Idaho in 2018. Virginia may also have another go at expansion after the Legislature thwarted Gov. Terry McAuliffe's attempt to expand Medicaid. Virginia voters elected Democrat Ralph Northam to succeed McAuliffe as governor in January, and Democrats made inroads in the state legislature, too. An exit poll of Virginia voters on Election Day found that 39 percent of them ranked health care as their No. 1 issue. More than three-quarters of the Virginians in this group voted for Democrats. A study from the Urban Institute may shed some light on why Medicaid eligibility remains a pressing problem: medical debt. While personal debts related to health care are on the decline overall, they remain far higher in states that didn't expand Medicaid. In some cases, struggles with medical debt can be all-consuming. Geneva Wilson is in her mid-40s and lives outside of Lowry City, Mo. She has a long history of health problems, including a blood disorder, depression and a painful misalignment of the hip joint called hip dysplasia. She's managed to find some peace living in a small cabin in the woods. She keeps chickens, raises rabbits and has a garden. Her long-term goal is to live off her land by selling what she raises at farmers markets. Her health has made it hard to keep a job and obtain the insurance that typically comes with it. And Missouri's stringent Medicaid requirements \u2014 which exclude nondisabled adults without children \u2014 have kept her from getting public assistance. Since graduating from college more than 20 years ago, Wilson has mostly had to pay out of pocket for medical care, and that's left her with a seemingly endless pile of medical debt. \"As soon as I get it down a little bit, something happens, and I have to start all over again,\" Wilson says. Right now her medical debt stands at about $3,000, which she pays down by $50 a month. She desperately needs a hip replacement, but she canceled the surgery because, even with deeply discounted rate from a nearby hospital, she can't afford it. \"Approximately $11,000 is what would come out of my pocket to pay for the hip. That's my entire pretax wage from last year,\" Wilson says. \"So it's kind of on hold, but I don't know if I can survive the year without going ahead and trying to get it done.\" For many people like Wilson, medical debt can be nearly as problematic as their illness. In 2015, 30.6 percent of Missouri adults ages 18 to 64 had past due medical debt, the seventh-highest rate in the country. Kansas, at 27 percent, had the 15th highest rate. In Maine, which voted to expand Medicaid this week, it was 27.7 percent. Researchers Aaron Sojourner and Ezra Golbertstein of the University of Minnesota studied financial data from 2012 to 2015 for people who would be eligible for Medicaid where it was expanded. They found that in states that didn't expand, the percentage of low-income, nonelderly adults with unpaid medical bills dropped from 47 to 40 percent within three years. \"The economy improved and maybe other components of the ACA contributed to a 7 percentage point reduction,\" Sojourner says. \"Where they did expand Medicaid, it fell by almost twice as much.\" Those states saw an average drop of 13 percentage points, from 43 to 30 percent. In Kansas, the rate of medical debt for nonelderly adults fell by 4 percentage points to 27 percent. In Missouri, the rate dropped 4 points to 31 percent, according to the Urban Institute. In Maine, it dropped only 1.4 percentage points between 2012 and 2015. Medicaid, as opposed to private insurance, is the key, says The Urban Institute's Kyle Caswell, because it requires little out-of-pocket costs. Even if Medicaid patients need lots of care, there aren't on the hook for big out-of-pocket costs in the same way someone with private insurance might be. \"We would certainly expect that their risk to out-of-pocket expenses to be much lower, and ultimately the risk of unpaid bills to ultimately be also lower,\" Caswell says. But Medicaid's debt-reducing advantages over private insurance could disappear under the leadership of the Trump administration. Shortly after Seema Verma was confirmed as the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, she and Tom Price, then head Department of Health and Human Services, sent a letter to the governors outlining their plans for Medicaid. The letter encouraged states to consider measures that would make their Medicaid programs operate more like commercial health insurance, including introducing premiums and copayments for emergency room visits. Verma says that by giving recipients more \"skin in the game,\" they will take more responsibility for the cost of care and save the program money. Republican proposals in Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would have eliminated or limited Medicaid expansion. And that would have affected the last few years' downward trend in medical debt. \"Anything that reduces access to Medicaid most likely would have the reverse effect of what of we're seeing in our paper,\" Caswell says. \"Reduced access to Medicaid would likely increase exposure to medical out-of-pocket spending and ultimately unpaid medical bills.\" As Geneva Wilson tends to her chickens, she says she tries not to think too much about her medical debt or how she'll pay for that hip replacement. \"It's going to the point where, if I were to go shopping at Walmart, I would have to get one of the carts you drive because I can't manage,\" she says. Wilson has already sold her jewelry, some furniture and a wood stove to pay down her debts. Now there's not much left to sell except her cabin and her land. \"Probably the homestead and garden that I want, that I've been wanting and trying to work for, I don't think they are a viable dream either,\" Wilson says. \"It's hard losing your dreams.\" This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, KCUR and Kaiser Health News.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks about health care on Capitol Hill on June 26. Single-payer was a major policy plank of Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will introduce a bill next month to create a government-run, single-payer health care system. And he knows it's going to fail. \"Look, I have no illusions that under a Republican Senate and a very right-wing House and an extremely right-wing president of the United States, that suddenly we're going to see a Medicare-for-all, single-payer passed,\" he said recently, sitting in his Senate office. \"You're not going to see it. That's obvious.\" The point of the bill, Sanders says, is to force a conversation: \"Excuse me: why is the United States the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people? Why are we spending far, far more per capita on health care than any other nation? Why do we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?\" Single-payer was a major policy plank of Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, and he has been ready all year to put it into legislation. He was just waiting for Republicans to wrap up their effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. That means Sanders has been waiting for a while. Despite President Trump's continued calls for Congress to repeal Obamacare, House and Senate Republicans appear to have moved on to other priorities. That means when Congress returns to Washington, D.C., next month, Sanders will roll out his bill. The measure is the latest example of how Sanders is trying to push the Democratic Party \u2014 a party he is not formally a member of as an independent \u2014 to the left. Sanders and his staff are confident a substantial number of Democratic senators will co-sponsor the measure. But many Democratic Party leaders continue to hold the idea of single-payer at arm's-length. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez regularly pivots to a broader answer about health care policy when he is asked whether he backs a single-payer plan. \"We believe that health care is a right for all, and not a privilege for a few,\" Perez recently told NPR. \"And right now, in Washington, D.C., in the political climate in which we live, preserving the Affordable Care Act is a major victory.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was more direct earlier this year when she was asked whether Democrats should run on a single-payer platform in 2018. \"No,\" Pelosi said. \"I say to people, 'You want to do that, do it in your states.' \" \"The comfort level with a broader base of the American people is not there yet. Doesn't mean it couldn't be. States are a good place to start,\" she added. Democrats in Pelosi's home state of California tried to pass a single-payer bill this year. The measure passed the state Senate but stalled in the Assembly, despite complete Democratic control in Sacramento, the capital. The resistance from Pelosi and other Democratic leaders is tactical, not ideological. It took decades to pass something like Obamacare, and their concern is that, despite what polls might suggest, something as aggressive as single-payer just isn't politically feasible right now. In fact, the congressional leaders you hear talking about single-payer are often Republicans, not Democrats. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans regularly float it as a worst-case Democratic alternative. \"Ultimately it's very clear that they're more interested in a single-payer system, which means government-run health care,\" Ryan said during the Senate push to repeal Obamacare. \"Government-run health care is not in our nation's interest.\" Senate Republicans even forced a vote on a single-payer option on the Senate floor last month, hoping to get Democrats on the record supporting the idea. Most Democratic senators voted \"present.\" No one voted \"yes.\" \"I urged my colleagues to vote 'present' because we are not going to dance to the tune of right-wing Republicans, who of course were not prepared to support a single-payer,\" Sanders said. \"For them, it was just a political moment that they thought would be advantageous for them.\" Polls show single-payer is gaining support. A recent Pew Research survey showed the number of respondents favoring government-run health care has gone up  percentage points this year alone and is 12 points higher than it was in 2014. In a more important metric, more than half of House Democrats signed on to co-sponsor a single-payer bill earlier this year. Jeff Weaver, a longtime adviser to Sanders, argues Democrats should be more aggressive on health care after a stretch during which broad swaths of voters organized against the GOP's Obamacare repeal effort. \"This is a very powerful issue, in that people are prepared to be mobilized in support of their health care,\" Weaver said. Like Sanders readily admits, this bill isn't going anywhere any time soon. The whole thing is more about political framing \u2014 getting Democrats to the point where this would be a top priority whenever the party is back in power. That is how progressive activists like Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, are viewing Sanders' impending bill rollout. \"If we left this debate with 20 senators on the record supporting single-payer, and the entire Senate Democratic caucus uniting around giving every American the option of buying into Medicare if they want to, that would be a wonderful place to land,\" Green said.",

            "article_content": "Democrats have a lot to figure out after the big wins of Republicans and Donald Trump last November. Democratic party leaders on Monday left the Beltway to launch their new branding effort.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Democrats have a lot to figure out after Republicans took Congress and the White House last November, so today Democratic Party leaders left the Beltway for a town park in Virginia to launch their new branding effort. They hope a more focused message will help them regain popularity with voters and maybe even retake control of the House next year. Here's NPR's Brian Naylor. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: They stood in the midday heat - the men with their shirtsleeves rolled up in the picturesque town park in Berryville behind a podium that read, a better deal. The town was chosen for its scenic quality and also because it's in the 10th Congressional District, one Democrats hope to flip in 2018. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer conceded what polls have shown - that voters know Democrats are against President Trump but need more. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: Too many Americans don't know what we stand for - not after today. President Trump campaigned on a populist platform talking to working people. That's why he won. But as soon as he got into office, he abandoned them. NAYLOR: Schumer outlined a populist agenda, calling for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, lowering prices on prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, and encouraging companies to provide training and apprenticeships through tax credits. And while some of these proposals are tried-and-true Democratic warhorses, Schumer took a page from the progressive Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing of the party, saying old-fashioned capitalism has broken down. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCHUMER: We're going to fight to allow regulators to break up big companies if they're hurting consumers... (APPLAUSE) SCHUMER: ...And to make it harder for companies to merge if it reduces competition. NAYLOR: The Democrats singled out the airline industry, cable companies and even breweries as examples of where consolidation has hurt consumers. Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia says the political debate inside the Beltway has become stuck in the past. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK WARNER: What we're trying to offer here is a better deal that recognizes that a lot of the challenges we face in America today are no longer left versus right or liberal versus conservative, but it's future versus past. NAYLOR: The better deal agenda has already faced ridicule for sounding like the Papa John's better pizza slogan. A group of Republican protesters emphasized that point today, holding up pizza boxes with a picture of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and the line, better jobs, better wages, still Pelosi. And voters seemed skeptical about the new campaign. Joseph Colson was down from Baltimore visiting his granddaughter and was unimpressed. JOSEPH COLSON: I started listening to politicians when Kennedy was running for president. And nothing's changed. The words are all the same. NAYLOR: And Anita Gallagher from Leesburg, Va., was even more blunt. ANITA GALLAGHER: I think it's baloney. I was very disappointed. Donald Trump wins the election by appealing to working people, the traditional constituency of the Democratic Party. And they talk about, you know, a few jobs here, a few jobs here, you know, cybersecurity jobs, blah, blah, blah (ph). NAYLOR: Gallagher wants to see Democrats move further to the left, reflecting that the party still has a ways to go to refine its pitch to win over working people.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York is by her side. Six months after Republicans gained control of the White House and both houses of Congress, Democrats have outlined a plan to improve their chances of methodically taking it all back. They are leaning heavily on a rebranding of their greatest hits \u2014 more and better-paying jobs, lowering health care costs and cracking down on the what are seen as the abuses of big business. As an agenda and a slogan, \"A Better Deal,\" hearkens back to the days of President Franklin Roosevelt. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer went 50 miles outside the Beltway, to Berryville, Va., to unveil it, hoping the ideas will resonate with suburban voters, many of whom were energized by Trump's campaign-trail populism. \"When you lose an election with someone who has, say, 40 percent popularity, you look in the mirror and say what did we do wrong?\" Schumer said, speaking on ABC's This Week Sunday. \"And the No. 1 thing that we did wrong is ... we didn't tell people what we stood for.\" Responding to the plan on Monday, President Trump tweeted that in releasing the plan, Democrats were admitting that it was their own fault they lost the election, and not Russian meddling. After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that \"Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia.\" Democrats say they want to double federal support for apprenticeship programs to help train young people and put out-of-work adults back in the work force. They also want tax incentives for companies to retrain workers, as well as new standards aimed at limiting corporate mergers that throw people out of work. In addition, the plan calls for lowering the cost of prescription drugs. \"We will aggressively crack down on unfair foreign trade and fight back against corporations that outsource American jobs,\" the Democratic leadership said in a statement. \"We will fight to ensure a living wage for all Americans and keep our promise to millions of workers who earned a pension, Social Security and Medicare, so seniors can retire with dignity.\" Berryville, with a population less than 5,000, is situated in one district that Democrats desperately would like to flip in 2018. It is currently represented by Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock and it stretches from just outside Washington to more rural parts of the state. Writing in The Washington Post on Sunday, Pelosi said that since taking the reins in January, Republicans have squandered opportunities to help average Americans. \"[Instead] of creating good-paying jobs, or rebuilding America's crumbling infrastructure, or advancing tax reform,\" she said, \"Republicans have spent six months trying to raise Americans' health costs to fund tax breaks for billionaires.\" Democrats need to wrest 24 Republican-held seats in the House to gain control of that chamber. In the Senate, however, they are playing defense, fighting to retain Democratic-held seats in states won by Trump.",

Andy Slavitt understands the inner workings of the U.S. health care system better than most. From 2015 to 2017, he ran the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, as head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Since leaving that post in January, he's been an outspoken critic of the Republican proposals to dismantle it. Yesterday, shortly after the release of the Senate bill, he tweeted, \"It's the ugly step-sibling of the House bill.\" And this morning his message was, \"We must start over. It's too important.\" The Senate discussion bill is out. It's the ugly step-sibling of the House bill. Analysis to follow shortly. Follow if interested. Slavitt spoke with All Things Considered host Kelly McEvers about the latest Republican plan, called the Better Care Reconciliation Act, and where the Affordable Care Act goes from here. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Fair to say there isn't anything you like in this new plan? Well, it's hard to say that you like the uniforms of the team that's got the guns pointed at you, trying to kill you. And I don't mean to exaggerate, but in the main, it's very hard to be supportive of something that takes health insurance away from 20 million or so Americans. The details that we've seen, at least so far, aren't particularly good for people with lower incomes. They're not particularly good for people who are sicker, and they're not good for people who are older. Supporters of the Republican plan say the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate forced people to do something they often didn't want to do. And that this new proposal would allow people to have more choice. True? Well, the individual mandate is about as popular as vegetables are with my kids. We know that. And we know that there needs to be something that helps keep healthy people in the pool, because if we leave people to their own devices to buy health insurance when they get sick, that will just drive the cost up for everybody. There are choices and trade-offs made within [the Senate] bill that we should acknowledge. If you are a 27-year-old person who makes $70,000 a year and has no illness, this is a good bill for you. If you are younger and don't get your insurance through your employer, your insurance will be cheaper. It will cover a lot less, but that may not be a problem to you. You may be OK with that. The challenge of course is that if you're over 50, or if you're sick, or if you live in rural areas and if your income is low, you pay the price. In fact, people who are over 50, many of them would be asked to pay as much as 50 percent of their income [for health insurance], and that's all in order to make the policies cheaper for younger people. The problem our country has is how to help people who are in the lowest economic straits, who have the most health challenges, get access to affordable coverage and, indeed, get well. The problem we don't have is how to help 27-year-olds get cheaper insurance. That's just not a national concern for us right now. You've talked about how the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. If the Republican proposal does not pass, what could and should be done to strengthen what's already there? This is really an interesting question because I actually am a big believer in bipartisanship, in large part because I don't think our country deserves to go through the back-and-forth of changing our health care system every election cycle. But the only way bipartisanship happens is if partisanship fails. If this legislation fails in the Senate, I do think we'll have an opportunity. There are a number of things that we can work on constructively to make insurance more affordable for people, to make insurance more competitive. I think if the people who drafted the ACA had it to do over again, there may be some things that would have been done differently. I think people would have liked to have had more enforcement of competition, more affordability for people in the middle class. I think there are plenty of practical solutions. The hard part is getting people to trust each other once again. Jessica Deahl edited this story for broadcast.",

Republicans postponed a planned evening vote in the House, denying them a symbolic chance to make good on their years-long promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Obama ticked off the law's successes in a statement released Thursday morning: 20 million more people insured, preexisting conditions covered, young people staying on their parents' plans until 26, lowered costs for women's health care and free preventive care. And while he acknowledged the law could get better, he charged that Republicans' plan would be moving backward. He said:  \"So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act. There will always be work to do to reduce costs, stabilize markets, improve quality, and help the millions of Americans who remain uninsured in states that have so far refused to expand Medicaid.  \"I've always said we should build on this law, just as Americans of both parties worked to improve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid over the years. So if Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if they're prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals \u2014 that's something we all should welcome. But we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans. That should always be our priority.  \"The Affordable Care Act is law only because millions of Americans mobilized, and organized, and decided that this fight was about more than health care \u2014 it was about the character of our country. It was about whether the wealthiest nation on Earth would make sure that neither illness nor twist of fate would rob us of everything we've worked so hard to build. It was about whether we look out for one another, as neighbors, and fellow citizens, who care about each other's success. This fight is still about all that today. And Americans who love their country still have the power to change it.\"  At the daily White House briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer jabbed that the former president's lengthy statement came because he was \"feeling time is up\" for the law.  Spicer insisted this would be the last anniversary Obamacare was celebrated.  \"President Obama attempted to move the goalposts on costs, downplaying the skyrocketing premiums, some in the case of over 100 percent in some places, and unaffordable deductibles,\" Spicer said.  He said the Affordable Care Act was in a \"death spiral.\"  But his comments came just before Republicans postponed the vote in the House for their alternative, as they were still unable to muster a majority to pass the GOP plan.",

He seems determined to keep up campaign-style politics even while governing.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump is getting out of Washington for a campaign-style rally Saturday, his first since becoming president. He seems determined to keep up campaign-style politics even while governing. Americans have complained for years about presidential campaigns that start too early and last too long. Now, they are confronted with one that refuses to end \u2014 even after reaching the White House. There may never be a \"last word\" written or spoken about President Trump's 77-minute barrage in the East Room Thursday, but the first word from many was: \"Wow.\" That was the initial reaction blurted out by Bret Baier at Fox News, as well as by Wolf Blitzer at CNN. For the first time since he took the oath, the president took questions from all kinds of news organizations. And he took them very, very personally. \"I'll tell you what else I see,\" the president said with some heat. \"I see tone. You know the word 'tone'? The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such \u2014 I do get good ratings, you have to admit that \u2014 the tone is such hatred.\" The impromptu news conference came sprawling onto screens everywhere out of a planned introduction for Alex Acosta, the new nominee to be secretary of labor. But Trump appeared and stepped onto the dais alone. This was to be a one-man show, and White House officials said it was very much the idea of that one man. In fact, Trump used the words \"I\" or \"me\" or \"we\" in reference to himself (the royal we) more than 500 times. \"I'm here today,\" he said, \"to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.\" Trump seemed flummoxed by all the stories about the firing of national security adviser Michael Flynn and dissension within the president's inner circle, stories that have been in heavy rotation throughout all forms of media this week. It was time to get the national focus back on the president himself and reverse the spotlight on his antagonists in the media. The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such \u2014 I do get good ratings, you have to admit that \u2014 the tone is such hatred.\" President Trump at a wide-ranging news conference Feb. 16, 2017 \"The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about \u2014 we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people,\" the president said. \"Tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it. To find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.\" Trump especially objected to accounts of his administration being in disarray. \"I turn on the TV, open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos,\" he said. \"Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my Cabinet approved.\" Admirers in the media called it \"feisty\" and \"combative\" and \"vintage Trump.\" The website Conservative HQ called it \"an epic beatdown of the media elite.\" When it was over, the White House staff was clearly elated. But detractors used an array of terms that began with the same two letters: \"unprecedented,\" \"unhinged,\" \"untethered\" and \"unbelievable\" being just a few \u2014 and \"unpresidential\" appearing often as well. Not a few watchers were unsettled by Trump's reference to Russia and \"nuclear holocaust\" or his mention of the Russian spy ship reported to be off the coast. Trump said he had encouraged his new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, to meet with the Russians, but added: \"I told him I know politically it is probably not good for me. The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water.\" But once again, the president seemed as concerned with how he won the presidency as he was about his actual presidency. He sounded very much like the man we all saw on the hustings in 2015 and through the long months of campaigning in 2016. At one point he referred to his 306 votes in the Electoral College as \"the largest margin of victory since Ronald Reagan.\" When Peter Alexander of NBC News pointed out there had been five larger ones in that time span, the president began to say, \"I meant for Republicans,\" just as Alexander was adding that George H.W. Bush had won with 426. \"I was given that information,\" Trump said. \"I have seen that information out there.\" The president often seemed to be responding in the manner of a candidate. He talked about a favorable Rasmussen poll (which does not meet NPR's polling standards for a good poll) showing him with 55 percent approval. Other polls this week from Pew Research and Gallup (more respected outfits) have him as low as 39 or 40 percent. He talked about the unfairness of the media and about the \"mess\" he \"inherited\" upon his inauguration. And he returned repeatedly to complaints about Hillary Clinton, about the free pass she got from the media, about her dealings with Russia as secretary of state and about a deal involving exports of uranium. The campaign mode continues this weekend, with the president again rallying like it's 2016. He teased it at his news conference: \"In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Fla., 5 o'clock on Saturday, and I heard \u2014 just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.\" Perhaps the campaign goes on because the president sees it as good politics. It enables him to dominate the cable coverage, much as he did in 2015 and 2016. By doing so, in all likelihood, he will keep his supporters enthusiastic and united. This will pressure congressional Republicans to back his versions of the policies on which they differ. These would include the replacement for Obamacare, the future of Medicare, the size of the federal deficit, details of new trade and tax arrangements and the commitment to rebuilding U.S. infrastructure. Or perhaps the campaign continues because it continues. The president does not yet seem comfortable in his new office with all the crosswinds and complications of divided powers and shared responsibilities. But he remains utterly comfortable onstage \u2014 especially in front of an adoring crowd and a national TV audience.",

Ben Carson, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, would not say that housing properties owned by Trump won't benefit from HUD programs at his confirmation hearing Thursday. The former neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate was pressed on the matter by Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who asked Carson for assurance \"that of all the housing grants he [has] the ability to bestow,\" not one dollar will go to benefit either the president-elect or his family. Carson responded it would not be his intention \"to do anything to benefit any American,\" quickly adding that anything the department does \"is for all Americans.\" Carson said, \"If there happens to be an extraordinarily good program that's working for millions of people, and it turns out that someone that you're targeting is going to gain, you know, $10 from it, am I going to say 'no'?\" Carson asked. \"Logic and common sense probably would be the best way.\" Trump's family made its fortune in real estate, and it still owns some rental properties in New York. Trump has refused to divest his assets, and Warren, who tangled with Trump during the campaign, charged the president-elect is \"hiding his family's business interests from you, from me, from the rest of America.\" In a later exchange, Carson said he would report to lawmakers on any dealings HUD has with properties owned by Trump or his family. For the most part, Carson had a friendly reception from the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. He told them that as a youth he understood what housing insecurity was, having had to move in with relatives after his parents split up. Addressing why, as a neurosurgeon, he wanted to take the reins of the housing agency, Carson said that while most people think of HUD \"as putting roofs over the heads of poor people, it has the ability to be so much more than that,\" adding he wanted to take \"a holistic approach\" to help \"develop our fellow human beings.\" Carson also said he thinks HUD's rental assistance program is \"essential\" and that it is cruel and unusual punishment to cut entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid before there is \"an alternative route.\" If confirmed, Carson said he would take a listening tour to hear from HUD employees \"with boots on the ground.\"",
