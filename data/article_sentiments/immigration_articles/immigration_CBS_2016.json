            "article_content": "CHICAGO \u2014 Immigration hotlines are buzzing. Legal clinics are seeing an influx of clients. Public schools are fielding frantic questions from parents and students. Since the election, Donald Trump\u2019s tough talk on immigration has stirred anxiety nationwide among immigrants regardless of legal status. They are turning to lawyers, schools, advocacy groups and congressional offices for help. \u201cWe\u2019re operating with a lot of unknowns, and a certain amount of fear comes with that,\u201d said Vanessa Esparza-L\u00f3pez, a managing attorney at the Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center. In Chicago, a hotline run by the state\u2019s largest immigrant-rights group received more than 330 calls in the week after the election, compared with the usual 100 or so. Denver school officials sent a letter to parents in response to questions about the election\u2019s effect on students living in the country illegally. The New York Legal Assistance Group said it\u2019s receiving 40 to 60 daily calls about immigration, up from 20 to 30. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles reported 19 walk-ins on a single day, all with citizenship questions. The most urgent inquiries have been from young people benefiting from a 2012 federal program started by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration that allows immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to avoid deportation and get work permits. About 740,000 people have participated in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals system. Attorneys say the program is vulnerable because it was created by executive order, not by law, leaving new potential applicants second-guessing whether to sign up. Andrea Aguilera, a 20-year-old college student in suburban Chicago, feels in limbo with her DACA paperwork expiring next year. She was brought across the Mexican border illegally as a 4-year-old and largely kept her immigration status secret until she was able to get a work permit through DACA four years ago. She\u2019s since worked as a grocery store cashier and intern at a downtown financial company. Two of her siblings are in the program; another is a U.S. citizen. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard to focus on school,\u201d Aguilera said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come next for us.\u201d During the campaign, Trump pledged to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally and to build a border wall. The Republican president-elect has not detailed how he will proceed and recently walked back the number of anticipated deportees. The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels, explained the spike in activity as uncertainty about whether existing laws will be enforced by Trump\u2019s administration. Jon Feere, a legal analyst at the Washington D.C.-based research organization, said those enrolled in DACA were aware of the risks when they signed up. Others should have little concern. \u201cThose who are in compliance with the law have nothing to worry about,\u201d he said. Still, even immigrants with permanent legal status have had questions since the election. Attorneys and immigrant organizations said green card holders feel new urgency to ensure that paperwork such as a renewal application is in order over fears that laws could change under a new administration. Most immigrants can seek citizenship three to five years after getting a green card. Roughly 9 million green card holders are currently eligible for citizenship, according to the most recent Department of Homeland Security statistics. Some citizens also sought clarity about when they could sponsor family members abroad. \u201cPeople need reassurance,\u201d said Irina Matiychenko, who leads the immigrant protection unit at the New York Legal Assistance Group. \u201cPeople need guidance.\u201d In Phoenix, local leaders planned a weekend meeting about being an immigrant in Arizona as an effort to \u201cguide us on the path of trust and unity.\u201d Staff members at the Chicago office of Democratic U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez reported an uptick in activity with at least 60 new applications for citizenship the past two weeks. School districts, including Chicago and Denver, used the election as a way to communicate existing policy. Denver Superintendent Tom Boasberg said the 90,000-student district sent letters in four languages home in response to what teachers were hearing from students and parents. The letter reiterated that school officials do not ask about immigration status when students enroll. \u201cIn a time of fear and concern, lots of rumors and misinformation spread,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to get accurate factual information to our families from a very trusted source.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As Donald Trump pulled off a stunning upset to win the U.S. presidential election early Wednesday, much of the world reacted with shock, but official messages of congratulations quickly started pouring in from foreign governments. \u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Pamela Falk says Trump\u2019s stated positions promise a new international mode of repeal and replace, including reforming U.S. relations with China and designating the communist nation a currency manipulator, reversing the international climate agreement, unwinding Obama administration immigration policies and increasing pressure on NATO allies. \u201cWe will get along with all nations willing to get along with us,\u201d Trump said in the early hours of Wednesday morning. \u201cI promise you, I will not let you down.\u201d  But Falk notes the 45th U.S. president faces a host of intractable problems, from violent extremism and nuclear threats to cybersecurity and foreign entanglements in Syria and Iraq.  With that as the background, a trend emerged on Wednesday morning, with the most eager and positive reactions to Trump\u2019s win coming from Moscow, and far-right politicians in Europe.  Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Trump a telegram congratulating him on his win. The two men had expressed mutual respect and even admiration for one another during the campaign process. In a brief statement Wednesday, the Kremlin said Putin expressed \u201chis hope to work together for removing Russian-American relations from their crisis state.\u201d Putin also said he has \u201cconfidence that building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington that is based on principles of equality, mutual respect and a real accounting each other\u2019s positions, in the interests of our peoples and the world community.\u201d State news agency RIA-Novosti says Vyacheslav Novikov, a member of the foreign affairs committee from the governing United Russia party, addressed the State Duma on Wednesday morning. Novikov said that \u201cthree minutes ago, Hillary Clinton acknowledged her defeat in the U.S. presidential elections and just a second ago, Trump began his speech as president-elect. I congratulate all of you on this.\u201d The chamber, where the pro-Kremlin party holds an overwhelming majority, then broke into applause, the report said. Earlier, before the results were official, the leader of Russia\u2019s nationalist Liberal Democratic party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, welcomed Trump\u2019s pending victory. According to the Interfax news agency, Zhirinovsky said: \u201cWe of course regard with satisfaction that the better candidate of the two presented to the American voters was victorious.\u201d\u00a0  He also said that he hoped Trump\u2019s victory would mean the departure of U.S. Ambassador John Tefft whom Zhirinovsky said \u201chates Russia.\u201d\u00a0 Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is congratulating the U.S. on its election - though not directly winner Donald Trump, who alarmed many by describing Mexican migrants as murderers and rapists.  Pena Nieto has sent a series of tweets repeating his readiness to work with Trump \u201cin favor of the bilateral relationship.\u201d He says Mexico and the U.S. \u201care friends, partners and allies who should continue collaborating for the competitiveness and development of North America.\u201d  The value of Mexico\u2019s peso currency plunged sharply after the election of Trump, who has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement that has led to billions of dollars in trade between the two nations.  Mexican Treasury Secretary Jose Antonio Meade held a news conference Wednesday morning, urging against \u201cpremature reactions.\u201d He said the election result won\u2019t immediately affect trade and said Mexico \u201cis in a position of strength\u201d to face whatever may come. French President Francois Hollande says the election of Donald Trump \u201copens a period of uncertainty. It must be faced with lucidity and clarity.\u201d  In brief remarks after the weekly Cabinet meeting, Hollande congratulated Trump \u201cas is natural between two heads of state,\u201d but showed little enthusiasm. Hollande had openly endorsed Hillary Clinton and said Wednesday he was thinking of her.  Hollande said \u201ccertain positions taken by Donald Trump during the American campaign must be confronted with the values and interests we share with the United States.\u201d  He says \u201cwhat is at stake is peace, the fight against terrorism, the situation in the Middle East. It is economic relations and the preservation of the planet.\u201d\u00a0 The first of France\u2019s politicians to react was Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the far-right, anti-immigration National Front party and the father of its current leader Marine Le Pen. He tweeted his support for Trump while his daughter also chimed in, suggesting the conservative victory in the U.S. could also herald her own party\u2019s rise in France. Dutch anti-Islam populist lawmaker Geert Wilders has tweeted his congratulations to Donald Trump. Wilders, whose Freedom Party is riding high in opinion polls ahead of Dutch elections due in March, calls Trump\u2019s win in the presidential election \u201cA historic victory! A revolution.\u201d Looking ahead to the Dutch vote, Wilders finished his tweet: \u201cWe also will give our country back to the people of the Netherlands.\u201d Wilders is known for his strident anti-Islam rhetoric and opposition to the Netherlands\u2019 European Union membership. The head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- the cornerstone of transatlantic peace and security since the end of World War II -- did issue a statement congratulating Trump, but there was anxiety in his remarks as well. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to ensure NATO allies pay more into the alliance, suggesting he could even withdraw the U.S. from it if other countries failed to pay their \u201cfair share.\u201d #NATO SG congratulates US President-elect @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/HS1palZsjl https://t.co/4PSAH5xDAc \u201cI congratulate Donald trump. I look forward to working with him,\u201d said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. \u201cIt is important that the transatlantic bond remains strong. We face hybrid warfare, cyber-attacks and terrorism. Our alliance has brought together our closest friends for almost 70 years.\u201d Adding that the NATO alliance would continue to be as important to American security as it is to that of Europe, Stoltenberg said he looked forward to welcoming Trump to Brussels for the group\u2019s annual summit next year. Chinese President Xi Jinping has conveyed his congratulations to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, saying he looked forward to working with Trump on promoting ties in a \u201cconstructive\u201d way that avoids conflict and confrontation.   During his campaign, Trump accused China of illegally subsidizing exports, manipulating its currency and stealing intellectual property.\u00a0 State broadcaster CCTV reported Wednesday that Xi said the two biggest economies in the world shared common interests and shouldered a \u201cspecial and important responsibility in upholding world peace.\u201d\u00a0 Xi says: \u201cI highly value China-U.S. relations and am looking forward to working with you to expand cooperation in all fields, including in bilateral, regional and global aspects.\u201d He says he expects they would \u201cmanage differences in a constructive way, in the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect, cooperation and win-win.\u201d\u00a0 Britain Relatively new British Prime Minister Theresa May, a Conservative Party leader who was herself swept to power as a result of the political turmoil in her country caused by the surprise vote to leave the European Union, congratulated Trump on Wednesday. \u201cI would like to congratulate Donald Trump on being elected the next president of the United States, following a hard-fought campaign,\u201d said May in a statement. \u201cBritain and the United States have an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise. We are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defence,\u201d she said. \u201cI look forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump, building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead.\u201d Earlier, Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party and one of the driving forces behind Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote to leave the European Union, tweeted out his congratulations to Trump.\u00a0 I hand over the mantle to @RealDonaldTrump! Many congratulations. You have fought a brave campaign. pic.twitter.com/txD3RFMQ2l Farage appeared once with Trump on the campaign trail, and the two share a strong belief in tighter controls on immigration into their respective countries. A spokesman for the Polish president says Poland cares a lot whether U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will implement NATO decisions to deploy military deterrence forces in Poland and the Baltic states.  Marek Magierowski says on state Radio 1 Wednesday that it is a priority for Poland to see the implementation of NATO decision to base for battalions in the region, including a U.S. armored brigade to be stationed in Poland, and also the construction of a U.S. missile defense base.  The region is concerned for its security amid Russia\u2019s rising military assertiveness.  Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz says he expects ties to be even better under Trump as president.\u00a0 A senior ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel says Germany \u201cmust also work together as well as possible with Donald Trump as the new U.S. president.\u201d  Volker Kauder, the parliamentary caucus leader of Merkel\u2019s conservative Union bloc, says that a \u201cclose trans-Atlantic partnership continues to be of central significance for Germany and Europe in the coming years.\u201d  Kauder pointed out that Germans and the U.S. share the same set of values and that \u201cespecially now we need to work on keeping up the good relations to the U.S.\u201d  German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, who also belongs to Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats party, had called the vote in the U.S. \u201ca big shock\u201d earlier on Wednesday.\u00a0 Trump expressed admiration for Merkel during his campaign, even while harshly criticizing her willingness to accept Syrian refugees. Last December, Trump attacked Merkel when she was chosen as Time Magazine\u2019s 2015 person of the year. \u201c\u202aI told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany,\u201d he tweeted at the time.\u00a0 Trump railed vehemently against the nuclear deal with Iran crafted by the Obama administration, which has brought the Islamic Republic huge economic relief after decades of crippling sanctions in exchange for a significant reduction in the country\u2019s nuclear program and stepped-up international monitoring of it.  The deal was intended to make it impossible for the Iranian regime to build a nuclear weapon for about a decade, but Trump and other opponents have argued that too many concessions were made, and it has only delayed the Iranian\u2019s quest to become a nuclear weapons power. Trump said on the campaign trail that he would tear up the agreement reached with Iran and five other major world powers. On Wednesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called on Trump to adhere to the international accords reached by previous American administrations. \u201cEvery U.S. president has to understand the realities of today\u2019s world. The most important thing is that the future U.S. president sticks to agreements, to engagements undertaken,\u201d he said during a visit to Romania. President Hassan Rouhani said his country\u2019s policies would continue to only influenced by the will and wishes of the Iranian people, and would not change based on new leadership in other countries.\u00a0 \u201cThe success of the U.S. in the eyes of the international community and world\u2019s public opinion has diminished due to its wrong policies, and a greater break with the international community and Europe will further weaken the U.S. situation,\u201d he said. \u201cOur policy on constructive interaction with the world and breaking up the nuclear sanctions has placed Iran\u2019s economic relations with other countries on an ever improving and irreversible path,\u201d Rouhani added. The U.N. Secretary-General issued a statement Wednesday congratulating Trump on his election victory, and urging him as the next leader of the United States to \u201cstay true\u201d to the spirit of the global organization\u2019s charter. \u201cIn the aftermath of a hard-fought and often divisive campaign, it is worth recalling and reaffirming that the unity in diversity of the United States is one of the country\u2019s greatest strengths,\u201d said Ban Ki-moon. \u201cI encourage all Americans to stay true to that spirit.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s global challenges demand concerted global action and joint solutions.\u00a0 As a founding member of the United Nations and permanent member of the Security Council, the United States is an essential actor across the international agenda.\u00a0 People everywhere look to the United States to use its remarkable power to help lift humanity up and to work for the common good.\u201d Ban also thanked Hillary Clinton for her decades of work in the interest of women, children and global peace, saying he was confident she would continue to do work in those fields. Japan is sending a top official to Washington to try to meet with those who will be responsible for the next White House administration. Katsuyuki Kawai, a political aide to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in charge of diplomacy, told reporters after meeting with Abe that he had been instructed to visit Washington as early as next week. Abe\u2019s instruction came when results showed Republican candidate Donald Trump with a clear lead. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said it was not because Japan was unprepared for Trump\u2019s win. He said: \u201cWe have been preparing so that we can respond to any situation because our stance is that our alliance with the U.S. remains to be the cornerstone of our diplomacy whoever becomes the next president.\u201d Later Wednesday, Abe himself issued a statement of congratulations: \u201cI would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations on your election as the next President of the United States of America.\u00a0 As a very successful businessman with extraordinary talents, not only you made a great contribution to the growth of the US economy, but now as a strong leader, you have demonstrated your determination to lead the United States,\u201d he said. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe stability of the Asia-Pacific region, which is a driving force of the global economy, brings peace and prosperity to the United States. Japan and the United States are unwavering allies tied firmly with the bond of universal values such as freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and the rule of law. \u201cI very much look forward to closely cooperating with you to further strengthen the bond of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, as well as for our two countries to play leading roles for assuring peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.\u201d News of Trump\u2019s victory hit hard in Cuba, which has spent the last two years negotiating normalization with the United States after more than 50 years of Cold War hostility.\u00a0 Normalization has set off a tourism boom in Cuba and visits by hundreds of executives from the U.S. and dozens of other nations newly interested in doing business on the island. Trump has promised to reverse President Obama\u2019s opening with Cuba unless President Raul Castro agrees to more political freedom on the island, a concession considered a virtual impossibility.\u00a0  Speaking of Cuba\u2019s leaders, Communist Party member and noted economist and political scientist Esteban Morales told the Telesur network that \u201cthey must be worried because I think this represents a new chapter.\u201d The nervous nature of America\u2019s much smaller neighbor to the south were made even clearer later Wednesday, when the government announced a five-day military drill to take place, to ensure preparedness for any potential \u201cenemy actions\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory. Turkey\u2019s justice minister says a change of presidents in the United States won\u2019t make a big difference to the \u201cdeep-rooted\u201d relations between the two countries. Bekiz Bozdag told the state-run Anadolu Agency on Wednesday: \u201cin essence our relations are relations between two states and we hope that under the new presidential term the Turkish-U.S. relations will be much better. That is our expectation.\u201d Bozdag noted that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s win came despite intense campaigning in favor of his rival Hillary Clinton. \u201cI saw an intense campaign for Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory. Artists, sportsmen, all personalities worked for Clinton\u2019s victory. But in elections, it is important to embrace the people,\u201d Bozdag said. \u201cNo one has won elections through newspaper headlines, opinion polls or television (campaigns).\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump as a \u201ctrue friend of the State of Israel.\u201d  \u201cThe ironclad bond between the United States and Israel is rooted in shared values, buttressed by shared interests and driven by a shared destiny,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cI am confident that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights.\u201d A top Palestinian official says he doesn\u2019t expect U.S. positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to change under President-elect Donald Trump. Saeb Erekat, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said the Republican and Democratic parties are both committed to a two-state solution of the conflict. The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967. Gaps between Abbas and Israel\u2019s hawkish leader on any border deal remain wide. Erekat said Wednesday that a two-state solution is \u201cin the American national interest, and I think this will not change with the coming administration.\u201d However, Trump has proposed moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, even though the U.S. has not recognized Israel\u2019s annexation of parts of the city. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has lashed out at President Obama for criticizing his deadly anti-drug crackdown, has congratulated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.  Duterte says he looks forward to working with the new American leader to further enhance the treaty allies\u2019 relations. Duterte, who took office in June, has had an uneasy relation with the U.S. The 71-year-old leader has announced his desire to scale back joint combat drills with the U.S. military and end the presence of foreign troops, including Americans, in the country in two years. However in a speech Wednesday, Duterte noted that he and the U.S. president-elect do seem to share some common ground: \u201cWe are alike,\u201d he said. \u201cWe curse over the smallest things. Mabuhay ka! (Long live Trump!)\u201c In Duterte\u2019s statement on Trump\u2019s victory released by his spokesman, the tough-talking Philippine leader was unusually diplomatic.  \u201cPresident Duterte wishes President-elect Trump success in the next four years as chief executive and commander-in chief of the U.S. military, Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said in a statement. Duterte, he said, \u201clooks forward to working with the incoming administration for enhanced Philippines-US relations anchored on mutual respect, mutual benefit and shared commitment to democratic ideals and the rule of law.\u201d\u00a0 Indonesians on social media are questioning why Americans have voted in big numbers for billionaire Donald Trump, who many in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim country perceive as intolerant and reactionary.\u00a0  Twitter, Facebook and chatrooms in instant messaging apps are buzzing with speculation about whether Trump would follow through on campaign rhetoric that included a ban on Muslims entering the U.S.\u00a0  Some people say that under a Trump administration they fear they\u2019ll be prevented from visiting relatives and friends who live in America or traveling there as tourists.\u00a0  About 100,000 Indonesians live in the United States.\u00a0  President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo says on national television that his government will work with whoever becomes president. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Donald Trump in a message posted on Twitter.  Modi tweeted that \u201cwe appreciate the friendship you have articulated toward India during your campaign.  He added that \u201cwe look forward to working with you closely to take India-US bilateral ties to a new height.\u201d  Trump had reached out to Indian-American voters at a rally in New Jersey in mid-October, praising Modi and vowing to defeat terrorism while acknowledging that India had suffered terror strikes, including the deadly 2008 attacks that killed 164 people.  In the Indian capital Wednesday morning, a small group of men from the rightwing Hindu nationalist group Hindu Sena celebrated Trump\u2019s victory at a central protest ground, where they brandished posters and photos of the U.S. president-elect while dancing and sharing sweets.\u00a0",

And most likely, they pulled out their laptops and surfed the web while doing so. Throughout the day, Google saw a variety of questions related to voting. But as day turned to night, the searches shifted, and voters focused on issues that mattered most to them as results trickled in. Here are some subjects people were searching for just two hours before polls closed on the West Coast (11 p.m. ET): It\u2019s no surprise people were searching for \u201cCanada immigration\u201d as the 2016 U.S. presidential election came to a close early Wednesday morning.

The website cic.gc.ca went to a 500 Internal Server Error throughout the night Tuesday and into the early hours on Wednesday.\u00a0 There was no answer at the Canadian Immigration Services headquarters late Tuesday, so it\u2019s not known if the website\u2019s outage was related to nervous from American voters. But perhaps some of those voters were looking to follow through on their promise.\u00a0 UPDATE: The Dow Futures have now dropped 840 points -- almost 4.6% #ElectionNight #CBSElection https://t.co/jk4xhdbWyb pic.twitter.com/9O3McEAlTb Overseas\u00a0stocks tumbled Wednesday as Donald Trump gained the lead in the electoral vote count in the\u00a0presidential election.\u00a0 \u201cRight now, the markets are heading for the hills, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d Robert Tipp, chief investments strategist for global bonds and foreign exchange at Prudential Fixed Income told CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s a function of fear as much as fact.\u201d As of 12:20 a.m. ET, Dow futures, which bet on the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, had dropped 840 points.

It came as a shock to Democrats -- as the state has historically gone their way. In fact, a Republican nominee hadn\u2019t won the state of Michigan since 1988, CBS News reported. People on Google clearly wanted to know: What happened? DEVELOPING: Dow futures are down almost 500 points, suggesting a huge drop in U.S. markets Wednesday. People were also frantically searching for \u201cDow Jones\u201d on Tuesday, which is most likely linked with the search for \u201cDow futures,\u201d which plunged about 5 percent early Wednesday morning. UPDATE: Wisconsin leans toward Donald Trump, CBS News estimates #Election2016 #CBSElection https://t.co/H9n7JKbYS7 pic.twitter.com/W1MhMUjWtb What\u2019s happening in Wisconsin? The battleground state was declared a \u201ctossup\u201d Tuesday evening. By early Wednesday morning, the CBS News Decision Desk reported that Trump \u201c[had] an edge\u201d over Clinton. Around 12:30 a.m. ET, the desk said the race was too close to call, and that it was still waiting on a vote count from the Milwaukee area. While commenting on the current projections in Michigan, a Clinton aide told CBS News her camp did not believe Clinton would pull out a victory \u201cin the end.\u201d That may come as a surprise to some, because Barack Obama -- a Clinton supporter -- won the state by 14 points in 2008 and 7 points in 2012. But others have pointed out that this year\u2019s\u00a0Democratic nominee hadn\u2019t visited the state since April.",

            "article_content": "BERLIN\u00a0-- German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s party formally re-nominated her as its leader this week, kicking off the country\u2019s 2017 federal elections next fall. It may be her toughest campaign yet. Following the election of Donald Trump in the United States and the rise of populist movements across Europe, the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party has seized on fears about the influx of refugees to gain momentum here.  And while there\u2019s little concern that AfD will come in first next year -- Merkel is still likely to win a fourth term in office -- their mere presence has upended German politics and forced Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union to shift its rhetoric heading into 2017.  \u201cThey are there, we have to take them seriously and they are a serious political new power,\u201d Peter Beyer, a CDU member of the Bundestag (Germany\u2019s parliament) from Nordrhein-Westfalen, tells CBS News. \u201cThey will not be so strong that they will be part of any coalition in Berlin, but it\u2019s 100 percent sure that they will be elected to the Bundestag next year, maybe even with more than 10 percent.\u201d Unlike in neighboring Austria, where Norbert Hofer of the far-right Freedom Partycame within a few percentage points of winning the presidency last Sunday, the far-right wields considerably less power in Germany.  A majority of German voters believe it\u2019s very likely that Merkel will win another term as chancellor. Polling shows she and her Christian Democratic Union have recovered in recent months; in the latest poll from the German polling firm Forsa, the CDU stood at 36 percent; AfD, meanwhile, had fallen slightly to 10 percent. \u201cIn spite of all the criticism that we saw on her refugee policy, we just polled this again this week -- two-thirds said they agreed with her decision to run again,\u201d said Peter Matuschek, chief political analyst for Forsa. \u201cAnd two-thirds also believe that she will remain chancellor after the next election.\u201d That said, the political environment today couldn\u2019t be more different from 2013, when Merkel\u2019s CDU won the biggest victory since Germany\u2019s reunification in 1990. AfD has proven itself to be a legitimate political force. After some significant victories in state and regional elections, AfD now holds seats in 10 of the country\u2019s 16 state parliaments. \u201c[AfD leader] Frauke Petry is not going to be chancellor of Germany come September,\u201d said Sudha David-Wilp, of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. \u201cBut the AfD could be a spoiler and create instability in the system.\u201d For Merkel, this means walking the line to hold onto the center that has served her so well electorally, and working to appease the base of her party -- especially the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavaria-based branch of her party known for its socially conservative views.  \u201cThere is a realization by Angela Merkel that she needs to cater to the base moving forward in this election,\u201d David-Wilp said. That challenge was clear to see in Essen this week at the CDU conference, as Merkel said she would not act on her party\u2019s vote to scale back dual citizenship rights for some Germans with foreign roots -- but endorsed her party\u2019s call for a partial ban on the burqa in Germany, a first for her.  \u201cOur law takes precedence over codes of honor, tribal or family rules, and over sharia law -- that has to be spelled out clearly,\u201d Merkel told CDU members, presenting a law-and-order pitch in her address to delegates. \u201cThis also means that it is important to show face when people communicate.\u201d Annalena Baerbock, a member of parliament from the Green Party, said AfD is undoubtedly moving other parties to the right -- and that worries her more than the AfD itself. \u201cMy biggest fear is that the conservatives -- and the part of the conservatives that come from Bavaria, CSU -- that they already are so nervous that they moved their party program already to the right,\u201d she said. \u201cThis moving, in my point of view, is more dangerous\u2026 than actually what the right party (AfD) is doing.\u201d Matuschek said Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats tried similar tactics in recent state elections in Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in an attempt to keep AfD from rising, with little success. The party came in second in Mecklenburg with 21 percent, pushing the CDU to third place; in Berlin it got 14 percent of the vote. \u201cThe Christian Democrats took this issue to campaign with the clear idea to keep the AfD down,\u201d he said, \u201cWhich did not work at all, because people see this as very clearly campaign politics.\u201d Exactly how best to combat the AfD\u2019s rise is a quandary for more centrist politicians in Germany.\u00a0 Like Mr. Trump in the U.S., AfD has succeeded by bringing in many voters who previously didn\u2019t participate in elections, but it also siphons away support from all of Germany\u2019s main political parties, not just the CDU.\u00a0 For a political movement that originally gained steam on the heels of the refugee crisis, the AfD -- like other far-right populist movements in Europe -- is tapping into a deeper discontent with the political establishment. \u201cIt\u2019s not just refugees,\u201d said Berlin-based pollster Alexander Mauss. \u201cLike in many other countries, and also in the U.S., I think there is a broader dissatisfaction with politics among a certain group of the population which haven\u2019t been voiced yet. And now, with the AfD, there is something where they can project their anger and annoyance.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "PARIS -- French President Francois Hollande announced Thursday that he would not seek a second term in next year\u2019s presidential election, saying he hoped to give his Socialist party a chance to win \u201cagainst conservatism and, worse still, extremism\u201d by stepping aside. \u201cI have decided not to be a candidate in the presidential election,\u201d Hollande said in a surprising and somber address on French television that recapped his achievements since taking office in 2012. The 62-year-old president - the country\u2019s least popular leader since World War II - said he was \u201cconscious of the risks\u201d his lack of support posed to a successful candidacy. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not a person, it\u2019s the country\u2019s future,\u201d he said. The Socialist party has been deeply divided over Hollande\u2019s leadership, with rebels within the party openly criticizing his pro-business strategy and calling for more left-leaning policies. Two of his former colleagues, former Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg and former Education Minister Benoit Hamon, already have announced they would run in next month\u2019s Socialist primary, alongside other low-profile candidates. Like other Socialist contenders, Hollande faced a Dec. 15 deadline for entering the party\u2019s primary. He was expected to say in the coming weeks whether he would run again. His announcement nevertheless came as a shock to political commentators, many of whom had thought up until he confirmed otherwise Thursday that the one-term Socialist leader was posturing to seek re-election despite being low in the polls. French network TF1 only said late in the day that the embattled leader would be speaking on its popular 8 p.m. news broadcasts, throwing French media into a frenzy of second-guessing what he might have to say. For weeks, Hollande had kept pundits in the dark and dropped hints that he hoped to continue in his job beyond next year. In a September speech, he repeatedly suggested he was eyeing a re-election bid. \u201cI will not let the image of France be spoiled ... in the coming months or the coming years,\u201d Hollande said at the time. Members of his entourage, including government spokesman Stephane Le Foll and Finance Minister Michel Sapin, said in recent days that Hollande was in a legitimate position to run again and to unite the left. Hollande repeatedly had said he would seek re-election only if he were able to curb the unemployment rate in France, which for years has hovered around 10 percent. The latest figures showed a slight decrease in the jobless numbers, but didn\u2019t seem to quell the criticism. His announcement Thursday came just a few days after his No. 2, Prime Minister Manuel Valls, said he was \u201cready\u201d to compete in the Socialist primary. Valls praised Hollande\u2019s \u201ctough, mature, serious choice\u201d in a written statement on Thursday night without saying if he would run for president. \u201cThat\u2019s the choice of a statesman,\u201d he said. Valls said Hollande had led France with a \u201cconstant concern\u201d for protecting the French people, an implicit reference to several attacks by Islamic extremists in the country in recent years. \u201cI want to tell Francois Hollande my emotion, my respect, my loyalty and my affection,\u201d he added. In his address Hollande avoided saying if he would support Valls - or any other candidate. The president\u2019s office - denying rumors of an internal battle - said the two men had their weekly working lunch on Monday at the Elysee Palace in a \u201ccordial and studious atmosphere.\u201d An at times emotional Hollande said during his televised remarks that he was standing aside so the Socialists would have a better chance of holding on to power, which he said was for the \u201cinterest of the country.\u201d Whichever candidate Socialist voters choose in January will face former Prime Minister Francois Fillon, among other rivals, in the two-round presidential election in April and May. Fillon, 62, who won France\u2019s first-ever conservative presidential primary on Sunday, has promised drastic free-market reforms, along with a crackdown on immigration and Islamic extremism. Polls suggest the sober, authoritative 62-year-old Fillon would have a strong chance of winning the general election amid the widespread frustration with France\u2019s current leadership. He did not waste time in hammering Hollande and the Socialists in a statement sent out minutes after Thursday\u2019s televised address. \u201cTonight, the president of the republic is admitting, with lucidity, that his patent failure is stopping him carrying on,\u201d Fillon said. \u201cThis term ends in political mess and in the decay of power,\u201d Fillon added, promising \u201caction\u201d and \u201cresults.\u201d Fillon, who was prime minister from 2007-2012 under ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, enjoyed a surprise surge in popularity in recent weeks. A rise in nationalist sentiment across Europe may have favored his strict conservative positions. France needs \u201ca complete change of software,\u201d Fillon said, promising in his victory speech to defend \u201cFrench values.\u201d However, it\u2019s expected he\u2019ll face a strong challenge from Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front party. Le Pen is running an anti-establishment campaign that particularly targets immigrants, France\u2019s Muslim minority and the European Union. The series of terror attacks on French soil by Islamic extremists that have left hundreds dead over the last two years has energized the country\u2019s political right, which has vowed to take a tougher stance against immigration. With a nod to the 2017 field, Hollande called on a collective reaction of \u201call progressives who must unite in these circumstances.\u201d \u201cAs a life-long Socialist, I cannot allow the dissipation of the left, its breaking up, because it would rid us of any hope of winning in the face of conservatism or, worse still, extremism,\u201d Hollande said. Centrist Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister under Hollande, also is seeking the presidency in the general election scheduled for April-May, but has decided not to take part into the Socialist primary.",

            "article_content": "By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto The Trump campaign has raised the possibility that the 2016 election may be rigged, and concerns about voter fraud resonate with some registered voters. \u00a0Twenty-three percent of voters think widespread voter fraud happens a lot, and another 32 percent think it happens sometimes.\u00a0 Trump voters are far more likely to believe widespread voter fraud happens in U.S. elections than Clinton voters. Despite these concerns, registered voters are more confident that their vote will be counted than they were eight years ago.\u00a0 Now, 45 percent of voters have a lot of confidence that their vote will be counted properly, up from 32 percent in 2008. Regardless of the outcome, three in four registered voters say they will probably accept the official election results as legitimate even if their preferred candidate isn\u2019t declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0 Clinton voters (86 percent) are more likely than Trump voters (63 percent) to accept such a result, though most in both camps say they will probably do so. Fifty-six percent of registered voters think it\u2019s very important for a losing candidate to publicly acknowledge the winner as the legitimate president of the country. \u00a0Seventy-seven percent of Clinton voters think such a concession is very important, though just 36 percent of Trump voters agree. But Clinton voters are more concerned than Trump voters about another potential source of election fraud \u2013 the possibility of a foreign government attempting to influence election and voting systems in the United States. \u00a0Forty-four percent of Clinton voters are very concerned about this, while just 26 percent of Trump voters are equally concerned. Fifty-six percent of voters expect Clinton to win the election next week; she has been the expected victor in the race since the question was first asked in June. But that figure is down from 63 percent two weeks ago and at the level it was in early October. Eight in 10 registered voters have heard something about the latest development in the Clinton email controversy, including nearly half who have heard a lot about it, and a majority of likely voters who have yet to vote -- 62 percent -- say the FBI\u2019s actions don\u2019t make a difference to their vote. \u00a0 Perceptions have grown slightly that Hillary Clinton did something illegal when she set up her own personal email and server for State Department business. \u00a0Forty-eight percent now think she did something illegal, up six points from last month, and the percentage who thinks she did nothing wrong has dropped six points:\u00a0 from 25 percent in October to 19 percent today. The allegations of unwanted sexual advances brought by a number of women against Donald Trump are also familiar to registered voters \u2013 six in 10 have heard or read a lot about these allegations.\u00a0 Although Donald Trump denies their validity, 54 percent of registered voters think the allegations are mostly true. Fewer than half of voters think Donald Trump respects women even somewhat, while more than half think he either doesn\u2019t respect them much (15 percent) or doesn\u2019t respect them at all (38 percent). \u00a0Thirty-one percent of men and 44 percent of women don\u2019t think Donald Trump respects women at all. Still, six in 10 likely voters who have yet to cast their ballot say the allegations don\u2019t make a difference in their vote, though four in 10 say they make them less likely to vote for him.\u00a0 Most Democrats (60 percent) are less likely to vote for Trump because of these allegations, while most Republicans (81 percent) and independents (59 percent) say the allegations make no difference. Throughout this campaign, both Clinton and Trump have been viewed unfavorably by most voters, and with less than a week until Election Day this hasn\u2019t changed.  When compared to past major party candidates, Trump and Clinton\u2019s unfavorable ratings are the highest in CBS News polling going back to 1984, when the question was first asked.\u00a0 Some voters are uneasy about what these candidates would do if elected president, although opinions are largely influenced by who voters support in this election. Three in four Clinton voters would be scared about what Trump would do if he was elected president, and a near equal percentage of Trump voters feel that way about a Clinton presidency.  \u00a0 On the positive side, about eight in 10 of each candidate\u2019s supporters feel excited or optimistic about what their candidate would do if elected, but Trump voters are more likely to be excited about his potential presidency (32 percent), than Clinton voters are about a Clinton presidency (16 percent).  Negativity about this year\u2019s election campaigns abounds. Four in five voters now say this year\u2019s campaign has made them feel more disgusted than excited. Similar percentages of Clinton and Trump voters, and men and women, say they feel disgusted with the race. Majorities of each candidate\u2019s supporters say they are at least somewhat enthusiastic about voting this year \u2013 but slightly more Trump voters than Clinton voters are very enthused.\u00a0 Nevertheless, at 49 percent of likely voters overall very enthusiastic, enthusiasm lags behind the excitement voters felt prior to the 2012 presidential election. Then, 62 percent said they were very enthusiastic about voting. Just over half of each candidate\u2019s supporters say they strongly favor him or her. About one in four have reservations, and a similar percentage says theirs is a vote against the other candidate. For most voters, whether or not someone supports Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have much of an effect on their opinion of that person.\u00a0  However, Clinton voters are more likely to view a Trump supporter negatively than vice versa. Fifty-one percent of Clinton backers say they have a less favorable impression of someone if they know they back Trump for president, compared to about a third of Trump voters who feel that way about a Clinton supporter.  Looking ahead, most voters don\u2019t see these candidates as bringing the country together. Fifty-seven percent of voters say Clinton would not be the kind of president that would unite the country, and 64 percent say that about Trump.\u00a0  Voters\u2019 evaluations of the candidates on key characteristics are largely unchanged since mid-October. Trump is more likely to be seen as a change agent than Clinton, but most voters don\u2019t think he is qualified, has the right temperament to serve as president, or is honest and trustworthy.\u00a0 Even more don\u2019t think Clinton is trustworthy -- 64 percent say that - virtually unchanged since mid-October. \u00a0Fifty-six percent of voters do think Clinton is qualified to be president, and a similar percentage says she has the right temperament. \u00a0 Still, fewer than half of voters think Clinton (48 percent) or Trump (39 percent) understands their needs and problems. And while more voters think the policies of both Clinton and Trump would benefit the rich over the middle class or the poor, 57 percent of voters say this about Trump, compared to 37 percent who think that about Clinton. About a quarter say the policies of Clinton and Trump would treat all groups the same.  The Candidates on the Issues Voters nationwide say issues (75 percent) will matter more to them in this election than the candidates\u2019 personal qualities (15 percent).  The economy and jobs (38 percent) is the most important issue for registered voters when it comes to deciding their vote for president this year, followed by national security and terrorism (28 percent).\u00a0 Further down on the list is health care (11 percent), while immigration is the top concern of just 7 percent of voters. Trump leads Clinton on who would best handle the economy and jobs \u2013 voters\u2019 top concern. Clinton has an advantage on foreign policy, health care and the issue of abortion. \u00a0They are closer on the issues of immigration and terrorism/national security. Amid news that the costs of some Obamacare premiums are expected to rise, the health care law has become more prominent on the campaign trail. 54 percent of Americans now disapprove of the law, an increase of six points in just the last two weeks. Since the health care law was passed in 2010, Americans have held a more negative than positive opinion of the law.  The demographic contours of the race have not changed much. The gender gap remains notable this year: by large margins men support Trump and women support Clinton.\u00a0 In fact, Trump\u2019s support among men has increased in this poll after dropping in mid-October, amid allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances on women.\u00a0 His support among men, and white men, is similar to what it was in early October. Trump leads among white voters, including white men and whites without a college degree. Clinton has the support of white college graduates, and women regardless of educational attainment. Those living in households with a union member also back Clinton by a large margin. With Donald Trump trailing in many battleground states and congressional Republicans scrambling to maintain leadership of the House and especially the Senate, Republicans are divided as to how their standard bearer has affected their party.\u00a0 While 39 percent of Republican voters think Donald Trump has been good for the GOP, 41 percent think he has had a negative effect.\u00a0 In contrast, just 17 percent of Democrats think Hillary Clinton has been bad for the Democratic Party.\u00a0 Nearly half (46 percent) think she\u2019s been good for the party, while 35 percent don\u2019t think she has had much of an effect either way. Eighty-nine percent of registered voters and 85 percent of Republicans now think the Republican Party is divided, a 32-point increase among Republicans from just after their party\u2019s nominating convention in July.\u00a0 A feeling of party unity is far more prevalent when looking at the Democrats. \u00a0Fifty-nine percent of registered voters overall and 73 percent of Democrats describe the Democratic Party as united.  With control of the Congress at stake in this year\u2019s election, some Republican leaders have expressed concern about the effect of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy on down ballot races.\u00a0 Right now, likely voters lean towards voting for a Democrat (49 percent) over a Republican (46 percent) for their representative to the House if the election were held today.\u00a0 Similar results were recorded two weeks ago. This poll was conducted by telephone October 28-November 1, 2016 among a random sample of 1,561 adults nationwide, including 1,333 registered voters.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News and The New York Times by SSRS of Media, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.  The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.  Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.  The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample and the sample of registered voters could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.  The sample of likely voters is modeled among registered voters (N=1,333), assigning each respondent a probability of voting based on their responses. The margin of error for the sample of likely voters is plus or minus three points.

Yeager, who is also director of The Ohio State University Stress, Trauma and Resilience Program, told CBS News, \u201cOn either side, whether you win or lose, the idea is to be a gracious winner or loser.\u201d Focusing on that approach will go a long way to keeping the peace in deeply divided families, workplaces and communities, he said. But it may be easier said than done.\u00a0 Marcia Abercrombie, 52, said she felt anxious by the time Election Day rolled around and is glad it\u2019s over, but she worries how people whose candidate lost will act \u2014 and act out. \u201cEverything has been so volatile. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen it this volatile in all the years I\u2019ve been voting. Everybody has such strong opinions,\u201d said Abercrombie, who works for a tech company in North Carolina and is also a writer. In October, her state saw a Republican Party headquarters in Orange County firebombed and just this week, gunshots were fired at a Trump sign outside a home in the town of Cary. Yeager said fear and anxiety are normal feelings after such an unsettling campaign season \u2014 even for people whose candidate won. If their choice was a so-called \u201clesser of two evils\u201d vote, they may still have reservations about what the future holds despite the win. Sharon McNamara, 61, a paralegal from Austin, Texas, told CBS News, \u201cI feel very drained. The tone right now is that people are very drained. People are very worn out. I have friends who have really strained their friendships because of this election.\u201d She wonders if those relationships will repair themselves now that the ballots are counted, or if the damage is irreparable. Research suggests the election results may not impact a person the way they anticipate, though, said James Maddux, professor emeritus in the department of psychology at George Mason University. \u201cThere\u2019s a concept in psychology known as emotional forecasting which is concerned with our ability to predict what we\u2019re going to feel if certain things happen to us. It\u2019s largely based on the research of Daniel Gilbert at Harvard. It finds for the most part, that generally speaking, we are very bad at predicting our own emotions, how good we\u2019re going to feel about something or how bad,\u201d Maddux told CBS News. Typically, we over-predict both, he said.\u00a0 \u201cWhen the good thing happens, we don\u2019t feel as great as we thought we would. And if we feel bad, we get over it rather quickly.\u201d The concept has held true when it comes to how voters feel after elections, according to research, he added. \u201cPeople are very adaptive and very resilient,\u201d said Dr. Michael Thase, a professor of psychiatry and the director of the Mood and Anxiety Program at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.  Humans have the capacity to make strong connections and experience powerful feelings, and that can be especially apparent when it comes to politics and sports, he explained. \u201cPart of the glory of being human is to be able to care deeply and connect your sense of who you are into what you believe in and what you want to happen and in this case who you are voting for. Because we can care deeply, when those bonds break, when you lose, it\u2019s not unusual to feel sad, down, blue or sometimes angry,\u201d said Thase. But it\u2019s important not to succumb to feelings that are catastrophic, he said.\u00a0 \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been campaigning for someone and are convinced they are the right person, maybe you\u2019ve gotten into demonizing the opponent. The odds are, though, they\u2019re not really a demon. We\u2019ve had very few demons elected,\u201d said Thase. If the election didn\u2019t go your way \u2014 and even if it did \u2014 there are many constructive ways to express yourself, say the experts: If life goes on and you still can\u2019t move past the loss, even after venting about it, reach out for help, or nothing will change, Thase said. Yeager said there are constructive ways to address very real fears about the impact of potential health care changes, immigration policies and economic anxieties that can come with a new administration. He said that no matter what the candidates promised, it\u2019s not all going to happen overnight. \u201cThe political system is very complex and moves very slowly in the United States,\u201d he pointed out, and that gives individuals and families time to plan and become politically active. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of those families affected, ask yourself, how can you become active at a grassroots level and how can you make a difference? How can you stand together in your community and make your concerns heard?\u201d Mary Brophy Marcus covers health and wellness for CBSNews.com",

            "article_content": "A high school senior, Yaocihuatl Reyes didn\u2019t pay much attention to the presidential race until she found her teacher sobbing and her east Los Angeles classmates terrified that the election of Donald Trump would lead to the deportation of their families. At that moment, the 17-year-old daughter of a nurse and security guard with little political upbringing said she felt driven to act. She and a friend asked students from nearby high schools in the predominantly Latino neighborhood to meet at a park, where they decided to lead a walkout. They made signs, wrote chants and mapped routes for the march to City Hall days later. Hundreds took part. \u201cWe just wanted to go and tell our community that we\u2019re here for them, we\u2019re scared, too, but we\u2019re not going to give up,\u201d said Reyes, whose family is in the U.S. legally. \u201cThis walkout was kind of for unity, to unify each other.\u201d Though too young to vote, thousands of high school students from Seattle to Silver Spring, Maryland, have taken to the streets since Trump\u2019s election to protest his proposed crackdown on illegal immigration and his rude comments about women. It is an unusual show of political involvement on the part of young people. And experts say that kind of engagement can lead to increased activism when they are adults. \u201cThe election has really promoted a feeling on the part of many people that just staying silent is being complicit, and so we\u2019re seeing a huge uptick in engagement,\u201d said Jennifer Earl, a professor of sociology at the University of Arizona who researches the internet and social movements. On the other side of the political divide, students have also rallied in support of Trump, though in smaller numbers. The so-called millennial generation - the youngest adult generation - is the most racially and ethnically diverse in the country now, according to the Washington-based Pew Research Center. Nearly half of millennials identify themselves as political independents, more than in prior generations, according to Pew. Young people who are politically active and concerned about issues are more likely to vote once they turn 18, said Joseph Kahne, professor of educational policy and politics at the University of California, Riverside. Many teens are using social media to spread the word about demonstrations. The best predictor of whether a young person attends a protest is whether he or she is asked to go, Kahne said. Reyes said she had never even attended a political event until earlier this year, when she asked her mother to take her to a rally for Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders. Oregon teen Cole Sandlin said he, too, had never attended a political rally before organizing one at his high school. He and a friend ordered flags online to support Trump, affixed them to their trucks and gathered in the parking lot before class on Election Day. The rally drew about 30 students. \u201cWe thought, this is basically our first election that we\u2019re involved in, that we ought to do something to show our political views,\u201d said Sandlin, who turned 18 shortly after the election and likes Trump\u2019s promises to revamp health care and trade. Sandlin said he has long been interested in politics and grew up watching the news with his father, a farmer in Silverton, Oregon. He said he plans to work on the farm after graduation but will keep up on political issues. \u201cIf there was something I felt compelled to share my opinion, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem doing that,\u201d he said. Nor would Reyes, who plans to attend college next year and major in political science, inspired by Sanders\u2019 campaign. She said also wants to organize a community rally in east Los Angeles with speakers on topics such as criminal justice reform. \u201cIt was kind of bizarre. I didn\u2019t think people would come,\u201d she said of the walkout. \u201cI just kept telling my friends, \u2018Wow, we actually did this. People actually came. It worked.\u2019\u201d",

Donald Trump won the election with 289 electoral votes. \u00a0On Thursday, Nov. 10, Michigan and New Hampshire had not yet announced a winner.\u00a0 The 2016 race that began 595 days ago and involved\u00a022 major candidates\u00a0is expected to end Tuesday as millions of voters head to the polls across the U.S. to cast their ballots for president, vice president, their representatives in Congress and other elected officials. On Monday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and former first lady, held a small 4-percentage-point lead over GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, according to a CBS News poll\u00a0measuring the state of the race before the polls opened. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, is Clinton\u2019s vice presidential nominee and Republican Gov. Mike Pence\u00a0is Trump\u2019s running mate. Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein are two independent candidates who will appear on some or all ballots. Evan McMullin is another independent candidate who could perform well in his home state of Utah. In order to win the presidency, a candidate must win 270 electoral votes -- a majority of\u00a0the 538 electors. CBS News will be keeping an eye on 13 battleground states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. 1:36 p.m. ET Retired four-star General Michael Hayden told CBS News that Trump doesn\u2019t fit \u201cinto the intelligence picture.\u201d \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s fair to say that he\u2019s become the president-elect by showing anger, by being accusatory, frankly, not being all that fact-based and scapegoating real and imagined enemies,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cNone of that fits into the intelligence picture \u2013 that\u2019s very alien to the way intelligence comes at an issue. And unless he has a conversation with what I call the fact-based, inductive, world-as-it-is people and they have a meaningful dialogue, I fear he\u2019s going to continue to act on this other set of beliefs and that\u2019s going to be very bad for America and for the world.\u201d  Throughout the election season, Hayden was a frequent and outspoken critic of Trump. The former NSA and CIA director was among 50 national security officials who signed a letter in September warning that Trump was a \u201crisk\u201d to the country\u2019s national security. --CBS News\u2019 Julia Boccagno 1:24 p.m. ET A trove of notable and outspoken Republicans who initially opposed Trump have begun to send congratulatory messages to the president-elect via Twitter.

At the center of discussion was the filing of top cabinet posts. The plan is to present Trump with top recommendations for cabinet secretaries. The team is also prepared to vet any additional names Trump may mention for consideration.  A few names have circulated throughout the 2016 campaign season, including: RNC Chairman Reince Priebus for Chief of Staff and American businessman Carl Icahn for Treasury Secretary. The transition team completed all transition binders on schedule last Thursday. They covered cabinet secretaries, domestic and foreign policy, White House operations, timelines for the transition and national security.\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett 7:34 a.m. ET President Obama extends an invitation to the president-elect Donald Trump to the White House on Thursday Nov. 10.\u00a0 According to a White House statement, the meeting is meant to \u201cupdate\u201d Trump on the transition planning that the president\u2019s team \u201chas been working on for nearly a year.\u201d --CBS News\u2019 Julia Boccagno 3:12 a.m. ET CBS News projects Trump wins the 2016 presidential election. 3:04 a.m. ET Donald Trump just finished speaking to his reporters at the Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan, declaring victory in the presidential race and confirming that Clinton had conceded. \u201cI just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us on our victory and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cTo all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.\u201d \u201cI pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans and this is so important to me,\u201d he added.

Canada\u2019s immigration website crashes amid U.S. election uncertainity The Canadian government website for immigration crashed Tuesday night as Americans on both side of the political divide experienced anxiety over the presidential election. And Google reported web search terms like \u201cCanada immigration\u201d spiked as the GOP candidate did unexpectedly well in the presidential election. The website cic.gc.ca went to a 500 Internal Server Error throughout the night Tuesday and into the early hours on Wednesday.\u00a0 There was no answer at the Canadian Immigration Services headquarters late Tuesday, so it\u2019s unknown if the website\u2019s outage is related to nerves from Americans on either side of the political divide. 1:40 a.m. ET Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s spokesman Zack Roday said Ryan called Trump and Pence. \u201cSpeaker Ryan called Donald Trump earlier this evening, and the two had a very good conversation. The speaker congratulated Trump on his big night and also spoke with his good friend Governor Mike Pence.\u201d 1:38 a.m. ET When do presidential candidates get recounts? The presidential race remains tight in several battleground states. Some of those results could be contested if the margins are thin enough when the counting is done. Here are the rules governing some of those states: In New Hampshire,\u00a0where the number of votes separating Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has been as low as 34 votes at one point Tuesday night and remains locked at 47 percent each, the rules are fairly liberal. Any candidate can call for a recount if the margin is within 20 percent. \u201cAny candidate for whom a vote was cast for any office at a state general election may apply for a recount, provided that the difference between the votes cast for the applying candidate and a candidate declared elected is less than 20 percent of the total votes cast in the towns which comprise the office to be recounted,\u201d according to\u00a0New Hampshire election law. \u00a0 Pennsylvania\u00a0demands a margin of 0.5 percent, and a recount would be triggered by the secretary of state. \u201cA candidate for a public office which appears on the ballot in every election district in this Commonwealth was defeated by one-half of a percent or less of the votes cast for the office,\u201d the law says. Nearing 1 a.m. Wednesday morning, Trump led Clinton there 48.5 percent to 47.9 percent. In Michigan, there\u2019s a mandatory recount triggered by a difference of 2,000 votes or less. But any candidate suspecting there\u2019s either fraud or a mistake can petition for a recount. At 12:52 a.m., Clinton lagged behind Trump by 52 thousand votes -- 1.785 million to 1.837 million. Like Michigan,\u00a0Wisconsin\u00a0also allows any candidate to request a recount if fraud or a mistake is suspected. The candidate has three days to make the request and has to foot the bill if the margin between the candidates exceeds a half percent.\u00a0 Minnesota\u00a0has tight requirements for a federal recount -- a losing candidate can request a recount if the margin is a razor thin quarter of a percent. Also, since 2008, all recounts in Minnesota are to be conducted manually. 12:36 a.m. ET CBS News projects Clinton wins Nevada. 11:36 p.m. ET CBS News projects wins Florida and Iowa. 11:17 p.m. ET CBS News projects Trump wins Utah and Clinton wins Oregon. 11:11 p.m. ET CBS News projects Trump has the edge in Wisconsin. 11:04 p.m. CBS News projects Trump wins North Carolina. 11:04 p.m. CBS News projects Clinton wins Hawaii. 11:00 p.m. CBS News projects Clinton wins California, Trump wins Idaho\u00a0 CBS News also projects Washington and Oregon lean Democratic.\u00a0 10:42 p.m. ET CBS News projects Clinton wins Colorado. 10:31 p.m. ET CBS News projects Trump wins Ohio. 10:29 p.m. ET CBS News projects Clinton wins Virginia.\u00a0 10:27 p.m. ET While CBS News hasn\u2019t called Ohio yet, Trump is performing well in the Cleveland suburbs.\u00a0 Donald Trump is overperforming in Cleveland suburbs. #CBSElection #Election2016 https://t.co/H9n7JKbYS7 pic.twitter.com/xmFOkkOMvm 10:20 p.m. ET CBS News projects Clinton wins New Mexico. 10:10 p.m. ET\u00a0Donald Trump could win election without his home state, and that\u2019s pretty rare: The list of presidents who have won the White House without winning their home state is short, but it could get one name longer tonight.\u00a0 CBS News has\u00a0projected\u00a0that Donald Trump will lose his home state of New York to Hillary Clinton. That means if he wins, he\u2019ll take the White House without the support of his state of residency. Only three candidates have done that before. James Polk lost his home state of Tennessee to Henry Clay in 1844, and Woodrow Wilson lost New Jersey to Charles Evan Hughes in 1916. Richard Nixon is the third candidate to lose at home, but win the country. He lost New York in 1968, his state of residency at the time.\u00a0 Most people think of California when they think of Nixon, which is the state he represented in the House and Senate. He even ran a failed bid for governor there. But when he lost the governor\u2019s race in 1962, he moved to New York to work for a law firm. When he won the presidency in 1968, that was his legal home. -- CBS News\u2019 Cydney Adams 10:09 p.m. ET CBS News projects Trump wins Missouri. 10:06 p.m. ET CBS News\u2019 latest Electoral vote tally is Clinton with 104 and Trump with 140.

Overall, she is beating Trump by 71 percent to 22 percent among all non-white voters. Trump\u2019s margin among white voters is 62 to 34 percent. Clinton is getting 84 percent of the vote from black voters and 62 percent from Hispanic voters. Among non-Cuban Hispanics, Clinton is winning 70 percent to 25 percent for Trump. Black women in Florida are supporting Clinton more strongly than black men with 88 percent of black women supporting her compared to 80 percent of black men.  White voters in Florida had different views about the fairness of the U.S. criminal justice system with 49 percent saying that it treats all people fairly while 39 percent said that blacks are treated unfairly. Among white voters who said that all people are treated fairly, 81 percent voted for Trump. Clinton received 61 percent of those voters who said that blacks are treated unfairly.  Sixty-eight percent of both men and women said that Trump\u2019s treatment of women bothered them a lot or some. Among women who said this, Clinton won by a 75 to 35 percent margin. Among men who said that that Trump\u2019s treatment of women bothered them, Clinton is ahead by a much smaller 54 to 35 percent margin.\u00a0 NORTH CAROLINA Clinton is running very strongly among younger voters. She is beating Trump 54 percent to 38 percent among voters under 45 although Gary Johnson is winning 7 percent of those voters. Trump is leading by a 53 to 44 percent margin among voters over 45.  Overall, Trump is winning among white voters by 60 percent to 35 percent for Clinton. This varies a great deal by gender and education. Trump is getting 70 percent of white male voters with no college education. Trump and Clinton are running equally among white women with college degrees.  There is no evidence of Republican women defecting from Trump in North Carolina. He is getting 93 percent of Republican men\u2019s votes and 91 percent of Republican women. Among Democratic identifiers, 92 percent of women are voting for Clinton compared to 88 percent of men.  Only 8 percent of North Carolina voters said they made up their minds in the last week, but Trump won 49 percent of their votes compared to 35 for Clinton and 13 percent for Johnson.  60 percent of North Carolina voters said that immigrants today do more to help the country and 70 percent of them voted for Clinton. 29 percent said that immigrants do more to hurt the country and 82 percent of them voted for Trump.  So far it looks like Republicans are strongly supporting Trump. We are seeing 90 percent plus support for him among Republicans in the states we\u2019ve looked at so far. One surprising pattern is that support for Clinton among black men is in the low 80\u2019s. Among black women Clinton is getting over 90 percent.\u00a0 OHIO Trump has the majority of the support of male voters in Ohio (55 percent Trump vs 38 percent Clinton). In 2012, male support was 52 percent Romney vs 45 percent Obama. Clinton\u2019s support among women (55 percent) is similar to the support Obama received in 2012 (55 percent). Looking at the vote by race is similar to what was seen in 2012. Trump\u2019s support from white voters is similar to the support seen in 2012 for Romney (Clinton 38 percent vs. Trump 57 percent as compared to 2012: Obama 41 percent vs. Romney 57 percent. The majority (89 percent) of black voters in Virginia are voting for Clinton, a bit less than the 96 percent level of support that Obama had in 2012. Trump continues to see support among white non-college voters, with almost 60 percent voting for him in Virginia. \u00a0 Union households are split between Clinton (44 percent) and Trump (49 percent) whereas is 2012 Obama \u00a0garnered 60 percent support amongst this group. -- CBS News poll analysts Stanley Feldman and Melissa Herrmann 9:13 p.m. ET Here is more from exit polling in Pennsylvania, which is currently a tossup between Clinton and Trump: The gender gap is alive and well among voters in Pennsylvania, according to exit polling: Males are supporting Trump (54 percent) while females are supporting Clinton (58 percent). Among white voters in Pennsylvania, over half are voting for Trump. Clinton has the majority support among black voters in the state (93 percent). \u00a0She also has more support among the white voters with a college degree (55 percent), while white voters without a college degree are more split in Pennsylvania (Clinton 46 percent, Trump 50 percent). Young voters (18- to 29-year-olds) support Clinton 55 percent, but that support is not as high as the 63 percent who supported Obama in 2012. Among voters who say that they decided who to vote for in the last week, over half voted for Trump. Trump is getting 90 percent of Republican men\u2019s votes. He has a slight dropoff with Republican women, getting 85 percent of their votes. Among Democratic identifiers, 91 percent of women are voting for Clinton compared to 85 percent of men.

You know, there are some areas being seriously contested, you know that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re gonna see what happens. Hopefully, I won\u2019t have to. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 the numbers are gonna start to come out pretty soon and we\u2019ll see what happens but hopefully I won\u2019t have to bother.

I appreciate his views on a strong America and the need to rebuild our military. #3 4:23 p.m. ET GOP nominee Donald Trump tweeted about his election night plans: I will be watching the election results from Trump Tower in Manhattan with my family and friends.

The judge seemed particularly bothered by the request to sequester ballots from a location \u2013 to match them up with specific people \u2013 and said that there is no way to do that. The judge eventually denied the Trump campaign\u2019s petition to isolate ballots that were allegedly cast after polls closed, suggesting the team pursue other administrative remedies first. --CBS News\u2019 Paula Reid 2:43 p.m. ET Trump, in a Fox News interview Tuesday afternoon, weighed in on the state of the election but declined to give a clear answer on if he would accept the outcome.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re essentially close to being tied, I guess,\u201d Trump said, referring to \u201cpolling booth results today.\u201d\u00a0 On whether he would accept election results if he loses the presidential election, Trump said this: \u201cWe\u2019re going to see how things play out today and hopefully they will play out well and hopefully we won\u2019t have to worry about it. Meaning hopefully we will win but we\u2019re going to see how they play out and I want to see everything honest.\u201d Asked to clarify whether he was saying whether the election will not be over Tuesday night, Trump responded in the negative.\u00a0 \u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m saying you have to look at what\u2019s happening. I have to look at reports that are coming out,\u201d Trump said, then cited unsubstantiated reports of malfunctioning voter machines. \u201cThere are reports that when people vote for Republicans the entire ticket switches over to Democrats.\u201d\u00a0 --CBS News\u2019 Reena Flores 2:12 p.m. ET\u00a0At a polling location in Pompano Beach, two poll watchers were fired for \u201cnot adhering to policy/training,\u201d Broward Department of Elections told the\u00a0Miami CBS affiliate.

Kaine emphasized that the key issue Tuesday is turning out voters, and he also acknowledged that the Latino vote could make a huge difference in some of the battleground states.\u00a0 First, he said Latino voters perceive a huge difference between Clinton and Donald Trump because Clinton and Kaine support comprehensive immigration reform and Trump supports \u201cbuilding a wall and deporting people.\u201d  \u201cBut the other thing that\u2019s really important, I think this is the election where the Latino community understands that they make a big difference, that they don\u2019t view themselves as a minor part of the electorate anymore,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cIn states like Florida, Virginia, North Carolina and Nevada, Colorado, all over the country, the Latino vote now sees that they could be a difference-maker.

            "article_content": "NEW YORK --\u00a0Thousands took to the streets Saturday across the United States as demonstrations against President-elect Donald Trump continued in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and beyond.\u00a0 Thousands of protesters marched from Union Square to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue Saturday, for the fourth day of demonstrations, CBS New York reports. Once the crowds arrived at Trump Tower in the afternoon, they spanned all the way down to West 51st Street, 1010 WINS\u2019 Darius Radzius reported.\u00a0 Police warned the protesters not to cross the metal barricades protecting the \u201cfrozen zone,\u201d but two did and were immediately arrested, Radzius reported. Otherwise, the demonstration has been peaceful. Protesters rallied at New York\u2019s Union Square before picking up steam and taking their cause toward Trump Tower. Police set up barricades in front of some of the most expensive stores in Manhattan as the group made its way along Fifth Avenue. \u201cI just can\u2019t have Donald Trump running this country and teaching our children racism, sexism and bigotry,\u201d said Noemi Abad, 30, a fashion designer, as she marched down the famous road. \u201cOut of his own mouth he made this division. He needs to go - there\u2019s no place for racism in society in America.\u201d  Trump\u2019s comments - particularly a 2005 recording of him making lewd comments about women - sparked outrage during his campaign. That spilled over into a fourth day of demonstrations following an election that ended with half of U.S. voters choosing the other candidate, Hillary Clinton.  In Portland, where some of the most contentious protests have taken place, several hundred people have started an \u201cunpermitted protest march\u201d near Pioneer Courthouse Square, CBS affiliate KOIN reports. One arrest was made short after 7 p.m. PST and two more were arrested about an hour later. A small group started with a peaceful anti-Trump gathering with people chanting \u201cpeaceful protest.\u201d Things escalated after that with people in masks and throwing things at police. This is the fifth night in a row that protesters have been demonstrating in Portland. Previous protests have grown out of hand, resulting in significant property damage and disruption. Police in riot gear are on the scene and working to control the crowd. Police made announcement over loud speaker telling protesters to move off the streets. In some areas, protesters were letting cars through, but other streets are completely blocked with people sitting or standing in the road. Over the loud speaker, police told protesters to stay on the sidewalk or they would be arrested. Police have already arrested more than 40 people over the course of 5 days of protesting and riots. Thousands of people rallied Saturday In Los Angeles for in a fourth consecutive day of protests denouncing the president-elect, CBS Los Angeles reports.\u00a0 The event organized by Uni\u00f3n del Barrio got underway at 11 a.m. and was expected to took emonstrators to downtown Los Angeles. As a precaution, police closed several on- and off-ramps of the 110 and 101 freeways to prevent protesters from getting onto the thoroughfares. Saturday\u2019s protest is was\u00a0 the largest march yet in LA against Trump. Overnight, 195 protesters in downtown were arrested as another protest against Trump came to an end. CBS Los Angeles said Saturday\u2019s march and rally remained peaceful. No attests were reported. There was some drama when police said a small group of protesters refused to allow a police SUV through one area. People chanted, \u201cNot my president\u201d as well as \u201chey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go.\u201d They also chanted, \u201cNo Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\u201d Jennifer Cruz, 18, of Ventura, California, carried a sign that asked: \u201cLegalize weed but not my Mom?\u201d - a reference to Californians\u2019 Tuesday passage of a measure legalizing recreational marijuana use.\u00a0 Cruz said her parents have been in the United States illegally for 30 years, although her mother has spent years seeking citizenship. She called the possibility of their deportation terrifying.  \u201cWe talk about it almost every day,\u201d she said. \u201cMy Mom wants to leave it in the hands of God but I\u2019m not just going to sit back and not do anything. I\u2019m going to fight for my parents, even if it kills me.\u201d  \u201cHe doesn\u2019t realize all the families he\u2019s hurting,\u201d she said of Trump.  Shawn Smith, 41, of Los Angeles, wore an American flag vest and held a glittery sign that said \u201cLove Trumps Hate.\u201d  \u201cWhat he\u2019s been able to do is make 50 percent of the nation look over their shoulder,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re gay, if you\u2019re LGBT, if you\u2019re Muslim, if you\u2019re Latin, if you\u2019re special needs, if you\u2019re female, it\u2019s a much unsafer place now.\u201d  \u201cWhat is happening today is going to be the normal for a while,\u201d he said of the demonstration, \u201cbecause we\u2019re not going to just sit back and watch our rights being taken away, our health care being taken away.\u201d  Protests were mainly peaceful, but in Portland, Oregon, a man who was participating in a march was shot after a confrontation with someone in a vehicle. Police expect the man to survive and detained four people in connection with the shooting. A motive for the shooting was unclear. The four people detained are believed to be gang members, but the victim is not.  The shooting followed rowdy Friday night protests, when police used tear gas in response to \u201cburning projectiles\u201d thrown at officers, police said on Twitter. Hundreds of people marched through the city, disrupting traffic and spray-painting graffiti.  Authorities reported instances of vandalism and assault during a rally that organizers had billed as peaceful earlier in the day.  In other parts of the country, spirited demonstrations on college campuses and peaceful marches along downtown streets have taken place since Wednesday.  Evening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta.  Trump supporter Nicolas Quirico was traveling from South Beach to Miami. His car was among hundreds stopped when protesters blocked Interstate 395.  \u201cTrump will be our president. There is no way around that, and the sooner people grasp that, the better off we will be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a difference between a peaceful protest and standing in a major highway backing up traffic for 5 miles. This is wrong.\u201d  Protests also were held in Detroit; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Olympia, Washington, Iowa City and more.  More than 200 people, carrying signs, gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted \u201cnot my president\u201d and \u201cno Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\u201d  In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic.  In Cincinnati, hundreds of protesters had already taken to the streets early Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest the jury\u2019s deadlock in the trial of a former white police officer who killed an unarmed black motorist in 2015.  A mistrial was declared in the trial of former University of Cincinnati officer Ray Tensing. He was fired after shooting Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing front license plate last year.  Anti-Trump protesters had joined up with trial protesters and marched through downtown.  In Chicago, hundreds of people including families with small children chanted \u201cNo hate. No fear. Immigrants are welcome here\u201d Saturday as they marched through Millennium Park, a popular downtown tourist attraction.  The protesters were chanting, \u201cNo KKK, no racists. USA. No Trump,\u201d \u201cNo more deportation. We say yes to immigration\u201d and other slogans, CBS Chicago reports.\u00a0 Michigan Avenue near Wacker Drive was blocked to vehicle traffic as the protesters headed toward what organizers said was a gathering near the Art Institute. On Saturday about 1 p.m. Richard Domenico Ehlert, an organizer of a larger group, said the group was walking heading east on Adams towards the Art Institute. His group is not named and Ehlert said the protesters are peaceful. Sonja Spray, 29, who heard about the protest on Facebook, said she has signed an online petition urging the electoral college to honor the popular vote and elect Clinton.  \u201cWomen aren\u2019t playthings. Journalists aren\u2019t pawns. People of color are not commodities. Marriage equality is not up for debate,\u201d Spray said.\u00a0 Ashley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re sore losers,\u201d said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation.\u201d  Demonstrations also took place internationally. A group of Mexicans at statue representing independence in Mexico City expressed their concerns about a possible wave of deportations. One school teacher said it would add to the \u201cunrest\u201d that\u2019s already in Mexico. About 300 people protested Trump\u2019s election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy near the landmark Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.  President Barack Obama meets in Berlin next week with Chancellor Angela Merkel and several other European leaders, and is expected to confront global concerns about Trump\u2019s election.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "CHICAGO -- Major U.S. cities and counties are beefing up legal services for immigrants to help them fight deportation and avoid fraudulent lawyers in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election and his hard-line immigration enforcement promises. Tapping local government funds to represent immigrants in federal proceedings provides an early example of the type of pushback the Republican incoming president will receive in Democratic strongholds. Advocates call it a matter of justice and smart economics, but some question whether it\u2019s a fair use of taxpayer money. Chicago has approved a $1.3 million legal fund. Los Angeles elected officials said Monday they are working with private foundations to set up a $10 million fund, while some California state lawmakers have proposed spending tens of millions of dollars to provide lawyers to immigrants facing deportation. New York is mulling a public-private legal fund, building on New York City\u2019s public defender program that\u2019s considered a national model. \u201cWe need to be able to stand by people who are fearful,\u201d Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff, said after the measure passed the City Council last week. Trump\u2019s pledges to build a border wall and deport the estimated 11 million people living in the country without legal permission have triggered uncertainty in immigrant circles. He has since scaled back the deportee number, but not detailed his platform. Since his win, a lack of legal representation for immigrants has become a growing concern. It was the top issue raised by a Chicago task force of leaders, including Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, convened after the election. Los Angeles County supervisor Hilda Solis said she\u2019s especially worried about the fate of unaccompanied minors and young immigrants who filed personal information with the federal government to obtain work permits under the Obama administration. In Los Angeles, officials want the fund set up before Trump becomes president in January. About half the money will come from the city and county and half from private donations. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how far the new administration will go when it comes to our nation\u2019s immigration policy, but we\u2019ve all heard the rhetoric, the dangerous rhetoric of the election,\u201d said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. \u201cAnd we are ready to support people who can\u2019t afford or who don\u2019t realize they might need a lawyer.\u201d Immigrants aren\u2019t guaranteed a lawyer in immigration court and only about 37 percent of those in deportation proceedings have legal representation, according to a September American Immigration Council report. Democratic state lawmakers in California have proposed legislation that could cost up to $80 million for immigration attorneys and other legal training. Santa Clara County is looking into the idea and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee added $1.5 million to a fund for immigrant legal services. In Chicago - where an estimated 150,000 people do not have permanent legal status - the money will be divided among two nonprofits. One will focus on poor immigrants facing deportation. The other will employ 200 \u201ccommunity navigators\u201d who will network through churches, schools and community events to find immigrants who are in the country illegally and help them figure out if they have avenues to stay. \u201cPeople are nervous,\u201d said Esperanza Villalobos, who already does the job in Mexican-heavy Chicago neighborhoods. She reports a surge in immigrants seeking her out since the election. In Chicago, which has some of the most immigrant-friendly laws in the nation, the debate over the fund had tense moments, highlighting how contentious the issue is outside Democratic strongholds. Chicago set aside money only for one year and is banking on private donations to keep it going. Three aldermen representing neighborhoods with strong Trump support voted against it, including Nicholas Sposato. He dismissed it as \u201cthe legal defense fund for the illegals\u201d and said Chicago should consider the money for other issues. The cash-strapped city diverted the funds from a little-used homeowner rebate program. \u201cI\u2019m not a hater,\u201d Sposato said during the vote at full the council meeting. \u201cAny given day, 1,000 homeless veterans out there. What are we doing for them?\u201d Another reason cited by local governments for creating the funds is the economy, because immigrants, regardless of legal status, work and pay taxes. In addition, children of immigrants who are deported may end up needing publicly-funded services such as foster care and health care, said Avideh Moussavian, a policy attorney with the National Immigration Law Center in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s the due process issue, but there\u2019s actually quantifiable economic impact,\u201d she said. In 2013, New York City tested a program to infuse public defender offices with money for attorneys dedicated to representing detained immigrants. The program has grown from $500,000 in its initial year to roughly $6 million. Attorneys have represented more than 1,500 immigrants from 2013 through late last year, the most recent statistics available. About 70 percent of attorneys won their cases, according to the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice. In Chicago, another goal is to help immigrants avoid fraudulent services, something 24-year-old Jose Lopez knows firsthand. The college student, brought to the country illegally as a child, qualified for a work permit under the Obama administration. Twice he sought out attorneys who advertised on Spanish-language radio stations. However, the paperwork they filed was unnecessary, his case stalled and he lost nearly $2,000. He\u2019s since obtained the permit and has a graphic design job, but hopes others can avoid his mistakes. \u201cI had to stall a career. I had to stall school,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to stall life.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president creates new uncertainties for a world economy that\u2019s already fragile, said investors and economists who wonder how far he will take his promises to tear up trade deals and restrict immigration. The real estate billionaire struck a conciliatory tone in his victory speech, arguing he would seek good relations and partnership with other countries. That has helped world markets and U.S. stock futures to recover some of the huge losses suffered earlier. But Trump\u2019s trashing of trade agreements -- including his promise to back out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership with Asian countries -- and the general lack of detail on key issues leave many uncertain about the direction of the world\u2019s biggest economy and market. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t know what type of President Trump will be,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics. \u201cWill he be the demagogue from the campaign trail, who threatened to lock up his political opponents, punish the media, build border walls and start a global trade war?\u201d said Ashworth. \u201cOr is he capable of becoming a statesmanlike figure who leads in a more measured manner?\u201d Uncertainty itself carries risks to the global economy and has been one factor slowing growth since the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession. It can make businesses and government postpone spending on new plants, infrastructure and jobs. Due to such uncertainty, risks to global growth will rise as companies wait to see what Washington does, said South Korea Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho. Trump\u2019s campaign tapped frustration among American workers who feel hurt by globalization and the loss of well-paid manufacturing jobs. He threatened to penalize U.S. firms that shift jobs abroad. Proposals including building a wall along the Mexican border to block immigration resonated with working-class voters who felt abandoned by traditional leaders. He has called for challenges to what he calls China\u2019s manipulation of its currency for trade advantage. Key trading partners appear nervous. Ulrich Grillo, head of the Federation of German Industries, said \u201cDonald Trump would be well advised not to seal off the U.S. economy from the world. Otherwise, the lack of clarity about the future course will lead to significant negative effects for the world economy.\u201d The U.S. is a major market for German companies like BMW and Daimler. By one estimate, some 1.5 million jobs depend on German exports to the U.S., the country\u2019s biggest trading partner. The U.S. and the European Union are already struggling to make progress in free trade talks due to anti-trade sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic. The trade section of Trump\u2019s website has no mention whatsoever about the talks. U.S. import barriers could hit economies such as China and South Korea especially hard as they struggle with slowing growth. China\u2019s exports in the first 10 months of this year fell by 7.7 percent from the same period of 2015 while its latest quarter economic growth of 6.7 percent is the lowest quarterly level since the 2008 global crisis. World trade in merchandise will grow this year by only 1.7 percent, the slowest pace since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, according to the World Trade Organization. In his victory speech, Trump adopted a softer tone but pledged to put U.S. interests first. \u201cI want to tell the world community that while we will always put America\u2019s interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone. With everyone. All people and all other nations,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will seek common ground, not hostility. Partnership, not conflict.\u201d Said analysts at FBR & Co.: \u201cTrump\u2019s consensus building will be an important signal to investors about the policy direction in the coming months.\u201d Domestically, Trump has pledged to overhaul U.S. infrastructure, something that could boost growth through higher government spending. He has vowed to spend $1 trillion on roads, tunnels, ports and bridges, citing the interstate highway system built by President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. But the funding details remain uncertain. He has emphasized private money and said the plan would not increase the deficit. An analysis in June by Moody\u2019s Analytics said fully adopting Trump\u2019s proposals on taxes, trade, immigration and government spending would slash U.S. economic output and eliminate 3.5 million jobs. It said the U.S. economy would be \u201cisolated and diminished.\u201d The Trump victory follows another populist election victory: the British vote to leave the European Union. And it could energize right-wing, anti-immigration and anti-globalization forces, such as Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s National Front. She is a candidate in next year\u2019s presidential election there. \u201cAs with the U.K. referendum, many people voted against the establishment as they believed they have been ignored for many years and the recent low growth, non-inclusive growth environment has only accentuated this feeling,\u201d said Martin Gilbert, CEO of Aberdeen Asset Management in London. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s victory is likely to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to delay another rise to its key interest rate. The Fed had been thought all but certain to hike interest rates at its next meeting in mid-December, reflecting a strengthened U.S. economy. But the uncertainty generated by a Trump victory could prompt the Fed to wait.",

            "article_content": "Delivering a shock to the nation\u2019s pollsters and the world at large, Donald Trump was elected early this morning to be the 45th president of the United States. He took the stage before a raucous crowd of supporters and announced that Hillary Clinton had called him to concede. Then, taking a more conciliatory tone than he has in a year, he vowed to be \u201cpresident for all our citizens.\u201d Many observers thought this election would be decided by Donald Trump\u2019s polarizing rhetoric, history of behavior toward women and questionable qualifications for the office. But CBS News exit polls suggest it was more a Clinton loss than a Trump victory. She won a lot of minority votes, but not enough to overcome her deficit with white voters. Clinton\u2019s gender may also have been a factor in the outcome. Donald Trump\u2019s victory has demolished so many baseline assumptions and truisms of American politics, on which politicians and journalists alike have based their thoughts and predictions, that it will likely forever change the way we think about and report on politics. We look at some of the most basic assumptions that, after Tuesday, have been completely upended. Will Rahn says the first thing we\u2019ll find out now is how interested Donald Trump is in actually doing the things a president does. Many suggested Trump didn\u2019t really want to be president. Clearly he did, but that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t be happy to outsource much of the mundane, day-to-day stuff. So, will Mike Pence be the most powerful VP ever?  From celebration in Russia and among Europe\u2019s rising anti-immigration far-right politicians, to nervous messages of congratulations from NATO and elsewhere, the world is grappling this morning with a U.S. election victory that has shocked America\u2019s allies and its adversaries. The fallout for investors in the U.S. and overseas could resemble what happened after Britain\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote -- only bigger -- judging by how swiftly and steeply global markets descended into chaos once Donald Trump\u2019s surprising path to victory became clear.

The presidential campaign is headline news in neighboring Mexico, where that \u201cwall\u201d (and who\u2019d pay for it) is a regular part of the discourse.  Russia has figured prominently with allegations of hacking and trying to influence the election. Some leaders have started to publically court candidates. Israel\u2019s prime minister has kept his options open, meeting with both, while North Korea\u2019s state media indicated that country would lean Trump. Sarah Varetto, vice president of news at Italy\u2019s Sky TG 24, believes people there are paying more attention to this election than in years past. \u201cI think in this case, with Donald Trump as a candidate, it\u2019s a huge story.\u201d Varetto says they\u2019re dedicating \u201cmore and more\u201d airtime to the campaign, because it\u2019s good TV.  \u201cWe cannot imagine two candidates that are so different, or more opposed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also because of this campaign. It is dominated by scandal.\u201d And, it\u2019s not just the personalities, but the political issues that are relevant. In particular, she says, the rise of populism, and not just in the United States. \u201cI think there is a part of society in the U.S., but also here in Europe that is not voting for something or somebody, for a political platform, but they simply are voting against the establishment,\u201d Varetto said.  Take Brexit, for example, the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, or Iceland\u2019s anti-establishment Pirate Party, which tripled its parliamentary seats in a recent election.  Sky News in Britain is promoting its coverage with a rap battle spoof that pits the \u201ccandidates\u201d against each other in a boxing ring. Appropriate, since in real life, this match has gotten ugly. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged it\u2019s made it tricky to push world leaders to promote democracy. \u201cThere are moments when it is downright embarrassing,\u201d Kerry said. At a rally in Iran, President Hassan Rouhani asked Iranians, \u201cIs this the kind of democracy you want?\u201d In China, where the ruling Communist Party often speaks through state media. A recent \u201cXinhua\u201d commentary noted the election revealed the \u201cdefects \u2026 of democracy,\u201d adding, \u201cthe selection of [the U.S.] leader has become a shouting match of insults.\u201d Still, CBS News found Chinese watching the presidential debate at a Beijing coffee shop, live at 9 a.m. The debates aired at 3 a.m. local time in Italy. Sarah Varetto told us Italians tuned in anyway. \u201cYeah, we have ten times the usual audience that we have during the night,\u201d she said.  People in each country, of course, are paying attention to the issues that will affect them most. In Iran, it may be the future of the nuclear deal; in Mexico, issues of immigration and trade.  In Italy, parallels have been drawn between Donald Trump and the scandal-plagued billionaire businessman and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The world is watching, and wondering, and can barely wait for November 9th. ",

In an essay for Broadly, the Oscar-winning actress confronted the anger and fear many citizens are feeling. \u201cThis country was founded on immigration, and today the only people that feel safe -- that their rights are recognized and respected -- are white men,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI want to be positive. I want to support our democracy, but what can we take away from this? It\u2019s a genuine question that we all need to ask ourselves.\u201d\u00a0 But Lawrence proposed more proactive approaches to the problems facing America than turning on each other following such a divisive election. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t blame anyone, we shouldn\u2019t riot in the streets. We should think strongly and clearly about what to do next because we cannot change the past,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about the health of our planet, find out everything you can about how to protect it.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about racial violence, love your neighbor more than you\u2019ve ever tried to before -- no matter what they believe or who they voted for. If you\u2019re afraid of a wall putting us all into another recession, then organize and stand against it.\u201d Lawrence admitted she doesn\u2019t have all the answers -- especially when it comes to her fellow women. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re worried that no matter how hard you work or how much you learn, there will always be a glass ceiling, then I don\u2019t really know what to say,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would tell my daughter if I were you.\u201d But rather than give in to despair, the \u201cHunger Games\u201d star urged U.S. citizens despondent over the election results to use it as motivation to make a change. \u201cDo not let this defeat you -- let this enrage you.\u201d she wrote.\u00a0 \u201cLet it motivate you. Let this be the fire you didn\u2019t have before.

            "article_content": "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Protesters were not slowing down six days after Donald Trump\u2019s election, many of them high school students leaving class by the hundreds Monday to carry signs and flags on the streets of several U.S. cities. They walked out in California, in Maryland and in Oregon, many declaring that their young voices matter and expressing concern over the president-elect\u2019s comments about minorities and the effect he will have on their communities. Some students said they had the approval of administrators. Some of Trump\u2019s supporters have called for the demonstrations to stop, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who dismissed the protesters as \u201cspoiled crybabies.\u201d Trump has accused some of being \u201cprofessional protesters,\u201d although he added in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview Sunday that he also believes some are afraid for the country\u2019s future \u201cbecause they don\u2019t know me.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at some of Monday\u2019s protests: ___ Seattle, Washington\u00a0 Police said they have arrested two men for assaulting officers in connection with a student demonstration in downtown Seattle against the election of Donald Trump to the White House.  Seattle police tweeted Monday afternoon that the men are not students with Seattle Public Schools.  Aside from the arrests, police say the demonstration continues to be peaceful. No further information was given about the alleged assaults. Seattle Public Schools spokesman Luke Duecy said more than 5,000 students from 20 middle and high schools walked out of classes Monday to demonstrate.  Students chanted \u201cWe reject the President-elect,\u201d among other statements. Seattle\u2019s mayor tweeted his support of the middle and high school students.\u00a0 Mayor Ed Murray said Monday afternoon on Twitter that he applauds students for taking a stand for inclusiveness.  Murray added, \u201cIt\u2019s important their peaceful voices be heard. Let\u2019s look out for each other & be safe.\u201d ___ LOS ANGELES Hundreds of students from several schools on Los Angeles\u2019 heavily Hispanic east side marched out of classes shortly after they began in a protest they say was organized over the weekend. The demonstrations began at Garfield High School, the subject of the 1988 film \u201cStand and Deliver\u201d focusing on teacher Jamie Escalante\u2019s successful college-level math programs. Students carrying signs and shouting slogans marched toward the city\u2019s nearby Mariachi Plaza. They were soon joined by hundreds of students from several schools, many of them shouting, \u201cSay it loud. Say it clear. Immigration, welcome here.\u201d Some carried signs reading, \u201cDeport Trump.\u201d Among the protesters was 16-year-old Brian Rodriguez, who said he is U.S.-born to parents from Mexico and Guatemala and was offended by Trump\u2019s criticism of Latinos. \u201cIt hurt me inside knowing somebody from outside our race is talking bad about us,\u201d said Rodriguez, who carried a sign that read, \u201cBrown and Proud.\u201d Rodriguez said his school\u2019s principal opened the gates and told students they could participate. Nancy Meza, a community organizer who announced the walkout, said she helped students organize it after they reached out to her. \u201cIt was really out of frustration of students wanting to voice their opinions,\u201d Meza said. \u201cAnd wanting to feel protected.\u201d ___ DENVER About 200 middle- and high-school students left two Denver charter schools to march to the state Capitol, where they chanted and held up signs saying, \u201cMillennial voice matters\u201d and \u201cMake peace not war.\u201d Police and school officials escorted the students, who attend Denver\u2019s Strive Prep Excel High School and Byers Middle School, along city streets to the Capitol building to ensure their safety. They called out \u201cSi, se puede\u201d -- Spanish for \u201cYes, we can\u201d -- and \u201cThe people united will never be divided\u201d as they waved their signs. Noelie Quintero, 17, who attends Strive Prep, said they were representing Latinos, Muslims, women and others marginalized by Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere -- we\u2019re going to continue to stand strong,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though we\u2019re only 16- and 17-year-olds and we can\u2019t vote, our voice matters. What we believe matters, and we\u2019re not going to stop.\u201d ___ PORTLAND, OREGON In a city that has seen some of the largest and most destructive protests, a few hundred high school students from at least four campuses walked out of class to gather in the rain in front of City Hall. Portland Public Schools officials said students from Beaumont, Irvington, MLC, Tabor, Sunnyside, Hosford, Cleveland, Wilson, Benson and Franklin were among the participants in the protest and march,\u00a0CBS affiliate KOIN reported.\u00a0 College students from Reed College joined the group, who held signs saying \u201cStudents for change\u201d and \u201cLove trumps hate.\u201d The protesters marched across the Hawthorne Bridge, some of them climbing up it, while officers stopped traffic. It comes after protesters smashed windows at Portland businesses and caused other vandalism recently. Daily demonstrations since Thursday have led to $1 million in damage and more than 100 arrests. Portland Mayor Charlie Hales says violent protests aren\u2019t a productive way to create change and believes they are being used in his city as cover for \u201coutrageous, bad, criminal behavior.\u201d A protest organizer says activists are reaching out to their counterparts in New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., and other major cities in an effort to keep Trump from prevailing on many of his issues. \u201cTrump is going to be president, so we need to prepare for that,\u201d Greg McKelvey of the group Portland\u2019s Resistance said Monday. McKelvey said they want to ensure local governments fight racial disparities in policing and help address global warming. ___ SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND Hundreds of high school students left campus and took to the streets to declare their opposition to Trump, while hundreds more gathered for a rally at a school football stadium. About 800 Montgomery Blair High School students attended the rally at the stadium, and most returned to class afterward, Montgomery County Public Schools spokeswoman Gboyinde Onijala said. The ones who left joined students from nearby Northwood High School, making up a gathering that Onijala estimated at 200 to 300, some of them chanting, \u201cNot my president.\u201d Police Capt. Paul Starks says the protesters were peaceful except for one bottle-throwing incident. No one was hurt. ___ New York Organizers in Manhattan carried signs in English and Spanish saying things like \u201cHate won\u2019t make us great,\u201d and chanted, \u201cWe are here to stay,\u201d on Sunday.\u00a0 As the protests continued across the country, President-elect Trump\u00a0told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d\u00a0Sunday about his\u00a0mass deportation plans\u00a0and urged Americans of all stripes to give him a chance after a tumultuous campaign that saw vitriol largely replace serious debate over policy. He also urged those people reportedly harassing Muslims and immigrant groups to \u201cstop it.\u201d\u00a0 The area surrounding the president-elect\u2019s Midtown home had become like a fortress, with Secret Service agents and NYPD \u00a0officers going to extremes to protect the future president,\u00a0CBS New York reported. More than 1,000 people joined the march in New York City on Sunday that started mid-afternoon and extended into the evening.",

            "article_content": "Among the many impacts of Donald Trump\u2019s Election Day victory is an apparent spike in Americans\u2019 interest in Canada. According to job-search site Indeed.com, U.S.-based searches for employment in Canada rose Tuesday night at 10 times the rate of previous nights. And Google (GOOG) reported that search terms like \u201cCanada immigration\u201d spiked as the election returns rolled in. Another telltale sign: The website for the Canadian immigration office crashed last night, and as of Wednesday morning it still wasn\u2019t operational. Media reports have blamed the trouble on a rush of traffic from skittish Trump opponents. \u00a0 Officials from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s far too soon to guess how many of these searchers will make a move after the shock wears off,\u201d said Indeed.com chief economist Jedd Kolko in a press release. \u201cBut the jump in searches shows how many Americans were surprised by Trump\u2019s victory and are thinking about their options elsewhere.\u201d A spokeswoman for My Visa Place, which provides immigration services to people looking to emigrate to Canada said the company is fielding more calls from worried Americans. \u201cThe phones haven\u2019t stopped ringing,\u201d she said. Canada, though, has plenty of its own challenges. Last year, its economy grew 1.1 percent, well less than its southern neighbor\u2019s 2.6 percent gain, as the country was hurt by low oil prices. Economists there don\u2019t forecast much of an improvement this year, thanks partly to last summer\u2019s fire in Alberta that destroyed an area the size of Delaware and forced a shutdown of its huge oil fields, which are now back on-line. Americans looking for a job in Canada may find few offers. Unemployment in October was 7 percent, well above the U.S. rate of 4.9 percent. Still, Canadian businesses added 44,000 net new jobs during the month, better than the contraction economists had expected. Lumberjacks might do well: Among the industries showing increases was natural resources, which posted its first noteworthy gain since March 2015. Looking ahead, IHS economist Arlene Kish said she\u2019s feeling optimistic about Canada, which she says is benefiting from an open immigration policy. \u201cThere are definite signs of improvement,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cAn increase in oil prices should result in a rebound in investment activity in energy-producing provinces, which we are just beginning to see now. As well, the federal government has an aggressive infrastructure investment plan (public transit, green infrastructure, social infrastructure), along with trade and transportation initiatives that will help create jobs, drive growth, and diversify Canada\u2019s economy.\u201d Not all Canadians, however, are as enthused about immigration, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s plan to resettle 25,000 Syrian refugees has been controversial. A recent survey by the Globe and Mail newspaper of 1,000 Canadians found that 39 percent of respondents wanted the government to accept fewer immigrants in 2017 than the 300,000 it admitted this year. Thirty-seven percent wanted the same number of foreigners to be able to permanently settle in their country, while 16 percent supported an increase. They weren\u2019t specifically asked about taking in more Yanks. Jonathan Berr is an award-winning journalist and podcaster based in New Jersey whose main focus is on business and economic issues.",

            "article_content": "As Inauguration Day approaches, among those wondering what a Donald Trump presidency holds for them are the immigrants living in the U.S. as \u201cDREAMers,\u201d that is, those who have qualified to remain in the U.S. under the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he\u2019d quickly terminate the immigration executive actions of his predecessor. That includes President Obama\u2019s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which protects immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents when they were young children. Under the action, they are given temporary legal status that they must renew every two years. Should Mr. Trump follow through on this threat, he could effectively guarantee the deportation of the nearly 750,000 immigrants who qualified for DACA. It\u2019s not yet clear what action he\u2019ll take. In an interview with Time magazine, Mr. Trump said of DACA recipients, \u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud,\u201d though a Trump transition aide told the AP that he didn\u2019t intend to set new policy. But with weeks until the transition, Democrats and immigration advocates are still hoping that the White House will find a way to shield these undocumented immigrants from deportation.  The question they\u2019re asking now is, how much can the president really do to protect DREAMers these once President-elect Trump takes the White House? Advocates have urged Mr. Obama to use what influence he has at the bully pulpit to convince his successor that rolling back DACA is against the country\u2019s best interests. Some are asking Mr. Obama for an executive order safeguarding the personal information of DREAMers, obtained by the federal government through detailed DACA applications. Others still are pressuring the Obama administration to use grant presidential pardons to protect these undocumented immigrants. (A presidential pardon would be binding, and neither Congress nor a new president could undo it.)  But some scholars and presidential pardon experts caution that these actions may not work. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the options President Obama has to shield DREAMers -- and why the president could ultimately fail to enact any of them.  Reps. Zoe Lofgren and Lucille Roybal-Allard of California and Luis Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois sent a letter to the White House within days of Mr. Trump\u2019s Election Night victory, urging the president to use his pardon authority to forgive DREAMers\u2019 civil immigration offenses. \u00a0 \u201cUsing your pardon authority, which is not subject to reversal, to protect these young people who relied on the program you implemented is quite literally a matter of life and death,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe urge you to exercise your Constitutional authority to provide pardons to DREAMers both retroactively and prospectively.\u201d  The White House issued a swift response, indicating that it would not consider a pardon en masse. \u201c[T]he clemency power could not give legal status to any undocumented individual. As we have repeatedly said for years, only Congress can create legal status for undocumented individuals,\u201d an administration official said in a statement.  House Democrats remained undeterred. In a statement to CBS News, Rep. Guti\u00e9rrez, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, says the White House still needs to explore its options. \u201cThe White House response completely avoided the question. We knew when we asked the White House to pardon people in the DACA program that presidential pardons are primarily used in criminal matters and do not confer legal immigration status on any individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want the White House to explore all the options before they say no to an idea that could help keep a lot of American families from being split up through deportation.\u201d  The Illinois Democrat went on to note that pardons have been used in the past to forgive offenses committed by large groups, citing President Jimmy Carter\u2019s pardon of those who fled to Canada to avoid the Vietnam War-era draft. \u00a0 And on Wednesday, Guti\u00e9rrez escalated his call to pardon DREAMers with another letter, signed by 63 other Democratic legislators.\u00a0 Still, advocates recognize the limits of this pardon power. For these undocumented immigrants, this clemency wouldn\u2019t allow them the work permits currently granted to them under DACA. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying this is a great option,\u201d Rep. Lofgren of California told CBS News. \u201cIt\u2019s just that given the alternative, it\u2019s better than a million kids living in fear of deportation.\u201d  But even if Mr. Obama considered granting a pardon, some scholars argue that such an action is not only unprecedented -- it could be unconstitutional.  Sam Morison, an expert on federal executive clemency who worked for over a decade with the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Pardon Attorney, noted that the U.S. Constitution specifically allows for the president to pardon for federal crimes and not civil offenses.  \u201cMerely being an undocumented alien -- that\u2019s not a crime, even if it\u2019s commonly colloquially referred to as an illegal alien,\u201d Morison told CBS News. \u201cSo there\u2019s no criminal offense for the president to pardon in that case.\u201d  Some, like Rep. Lofgren, who is also an immigration attorney, have argued for an interpretation of the Constitution that says \u201cthe power to parole is not limited to criminal offenses.\u201d  But even if the president could forgive civil offenses, P.S. Ruckman, a professor of political science at Northern Illinois University and an expert on presidential pardons, warned that clemency applies to the past, not to the future. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t seem likely to me is that the president could pardon persons for past offenses and, at the same time, immunize them from ever being punished again for repeated, separate violations,\u201d Ruckman told CBS News. \u201cClemency in perpetuity does strike me very much as granting [and] declaring status.\u201d  On a technical level, Rep. Judy Chu, D-California is concerned about the possibility that the Trump administration could DACA recipients\u2019 information against them. She wants to make sure the information DACA recipients have already given the government won\u2019t be used to deport them. As a result, Chu is asking the president to protect the personal information, including fingerprints and relatives\u2019 home addresses, gathered when undocumented immigrants applied for DACA.  \u201cWe are looking for an executive order,\u201d Chu told CBS News. \u201cIt\u2019s to protect the personal information of the DREAMers and to ensure that it is not used for later deportation proceedings.\u201d  An executive order to secure the information provided to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, however, faces the same threat of rollback by the incoming administration.  David Leopold, an immigration attorney who has advised advocacy groups like America\u2019s Voice, suggested that the most effective route President Obama could take is to convince Mr. Trump, who seems open to amending his initial hardline immigration proposals, of DACA\u2019s benefits. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe most important thing that the president could do is to, in either private discussions or public statements, use any influence he might have with the president-elect to see to it that DACA is not removed,\u201d Leopold said.  The president-elect might entertain suggestions from his predecessor -- Mr. Trump said this week that he continues to consult with Mr. Obama, and he has previously said the president has influenced his thinking on keeping certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0 Manuel Bartsch, a DACA recipient who was brought to the U.S. from Germany when he was 11 years old, told CBS News that the president-elect\u2019s flexible promises have given him some measure of hope. \u201cHe\u2019s already flip flopped on a few things, such as Obamacare,\u201d Bartsch said, \u201cso why not immigration?\u201d\u00a0 In his interview with Time magazine for their \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d feature, Mr. Trump addressed the possibility.\u00a0 \u201cI want Dreamers for our children also,\u201d the president-elect told Time. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out. On a humanitarian basis it\u2019s a very tough situation. We\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud. But that\u2019s a very tough situation.\u201d Immigration advocates retain some hope that the Senate can deliver some relief for DACA recipients. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, is currently working towards a bipartisan bill aimed specifically at those granted reprieve under DACA, according to a recent Politico report. Other senators who have appeared to commit to the push include Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois.  \u201cThe worst outcome is to repeal the legal status that these kids have,\u201d Graham told the news outlet in November. \u201cWhether you agree with them having it or not, they\u2019ve come out of the shadows.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is only days into being the country\u2019s president-elect, and the questions are already piling up for him. In his first extensive post-election interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Trump answered questions about his policy priorities as president, including which areas might ultimately look a bit different than what he said on the campaign trail. \u201cIt\u2019s enormous,\u201d he told correspondent Lesley Stahl with \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve done a lotta big things, I\u2019ve never done anything like this. It is -- it is so big, it is so -- it\u2019s so enormous, it\u2019s so amazing.\u201d Asked whether it took his breath away late last Tuesday night when he realized he would be the 45th president, Trump replied: \u201cA little bit.\u201d  \u201cAnd I think -- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now,\u201d he added.  As Trump adjusts to his post-election reality, there are \u00a0issues on which his post-election stances don\u2019t quite match his campaign-trail rhetoric -- several of which he addressed with \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Speaking about his potential picks for the Supreme Court, Trump was asked whether he supports same-sex marriage -- and he said he is \u201cfine\u201d with it. \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant because it was already settled. It\u2019s law,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it\u2019s done \u2026 these cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They\u2019ve been settled. And I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d On other issues, too, Trump signaled a willingness to depart from his previous campaign statements. Despite frequent cries of \u201cLock her up!\u201d and \u201cHillary for prison\u201d at his campaign rallies -- and his suggestion during the presidential debates that he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server -- Trump said he has not decided whether to prosecute Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m going to think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cUm, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on -- all of these other things that we\u2019ve been talking about.\u201d Clinton \u201cdid some bad things,\u201d he said, but added that ultimately the Clintons are \u201cgood people.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt them, I don\u2019t want to hurt them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re, they\u2019re good people. I don\u2019t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.\u201d On health care, Trump said he is open to amending the Affordable Care Act or keeping pieces of it that are popular, such as coverage for people with pre-existing conditions or children under 26 who want to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance. \u201cIt happens to be one of the strongest assets,\u201d Trump said about insuring people with pre-existing conditions. \u201cIt adds cost, but it\u2019s very much something we\u2019re gonna try and keep.\u201d When it comes to immigration, Trump said his priority is to deport undocumented immigrants with a criminal record -- which he estimated would include 2 to 3 million people -- and said he is open for some of his famous border wall to be made up of fences instead. \u201cFor certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very good at this, it\u2019s called construction.\u201d Trump, who met President Obama for the first time when Trump visited the White House last week, called the president \u201cterrific,\u201d adding that despite their differences of opinion he had a productive 90-minute conversation with Mr. Obama. \u201cI found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice,\u201d Trump said. \u201c...Again, I never met him before, but we had -- we had a very good chemistry going. And -- and I really found -- it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the -- the conversation unbelievably interesting.\u201d Trump said he believes he\u2019s a \u201csober\u201d person, not the \u201cwild man\u201d he believes the media has made him out to be. That, he said, was apparent in his serious expression while meeting with President Obama at the White House last week. \u201cNo, I think I\u2019m a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different -- in my case, a little bit of a wild man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m actually not. I\u2019m a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the President.\u201d  Trump said Clinton was gracious in congratulating him for his victory -- and despite referring to her throughout the campaign as \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d said Clinton is \u201cvery strong and very smart.\u201d \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been nicer. She just said, \u2018Congratulations, Donald, well done,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor.\u2019 She is very strong and very smart.\u201d Does Trump regret the harsh and often vitriolic tone of the campaign? He says he doesn\u2019t. \u201cI can\u2019t regret. No-- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say,\u201d he said. \u201cBut \u2026 it really is something that I\u2019m very proud of. I mean, it was a tremendous campaign.\u201d Still, Trump said he was \u201csaddened\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d to hear that his supporters are inciting violence after his victory, especially targeting minorities or gay people. Asked whether he had any message for those supporters, Trump replied: \u201cStop it.\u201d \u201cI would say don\u2019t do it, that\u2019s terrible, \u2018cause I\u2019m gonna bring this country together,\u201d he responded. Told that they were harassing Latinos and Muslims, he added, \u201cI am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \u2018Stop it.\u2019 If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "With immigration taking a front seat in the U.S. presidential election, some voters may be wondering just how many unauthorized immigrants are working in the American labor market.  The answer: Not as many as there were in 2008, according to new research from the Pew Research Center, which analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau. About 8 million unauthorized workers held jobs in the U.S. labor force in 2014, down from 8.3 million in 2008, during the recession, and 8.1 million in 2009. Since 2009, the American labor force -- or workers who were born in the U.S. or are lawful immigrants working here -- has expanded by 2.2 percent, which means unlawful immigrants are making up a smaller share of the labor force than they did in 2009.  Republican candidate Donald Trump has focused on immigration as one of his top policy issues, saying that enforcing stricter regulations will boost wages and \u201censure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.\u201d Trump also insists as president he\u2019d build a wall across the border with Mexico, even though, as Pew found in a September report, the number of unauthorized Mexicans living in the U.S. has declined by about 500,000 since 2009.\u00a0 With the rhetoric heating up about immigration, there are some widespread misperceptions about unauthorized immigrants, said Pew demographer Jeffrey Passel. \u201cI\u2019ve described the discussion as fact-free,\u201d he said. \u201cThis notion that they are doing jobs that Americans want to do doesn\u2019t show up in our data.\u201d Unauthorized immigrant workers tend to concentrate within a few industries, such as agriculture and construction, Pew found. But even the occupations with the largest share of unauthorized immigrant workers -- such as drywall installers, where unauthorized immigrants comprise 31 percent of all workers -- still had a much larger share of native-born employees.  \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that they \u201ctake jobs\u201d from natives,\u201d Passel said. \u201cThe major consequence is expanding the labor market, and expanding the economy. To the extent that there are groups out there that are affected by new immigrants, the main one is the previous immigrants.\u201d In some occupations, immigrants are filling in roles where native-born workers have retired, or they are finding work in occupations that aren\u2019t as appealing to U.S.-born workers, who typically have the means to find more job opportunities than illegal immigrants. Not surprisingly, unauthorized immigrants tend to work in low-skilled occupations, which is likely due to a lack of education as well as language barriers and the difficulty in finding other work because of their legal status.  So where are unauthorized immigrants coming from? Mexicans make up the biggest slice of the pie, despite their declining numbers. About 5.85 million unauthorized immigrants are from Mexico, compared with 700,000 from El Salvador, which is the second most likely country of birth for unauthorized immigrants. The country representing the biggest increase in unauthorized immigrants since 2009 is India, Pew found earlier this year. Since 2009, there has been an increase in unauthorized immigrants coming from China, Guatemala, and, lastly, Canada.  The ranks of unauthorized workers declined in eight U.S. states from 2009 to 2014, including California, Georgia and South Carolina, while seven states witnessed increases in the number of unauthorized immigrants in their labor forces, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Pew found.  Below are the 10 occupations with the highest share of unauthorized immigrant workers in 2014, according to Pew\u2019s analysis of the latest available data.  1. Drywall installers (31 percent of drywall installers are unauthorized immigrants)2. Miscellaneous agricultural workers (30 percent)3. Roofers (29 percent)4. Painters, construction and maintenance (26 percent)5. Brickmasons, block masons and stonemasons (25 percent)6. Maids, housekeepers and cleaners (24 percent)7. Carpet, floor and tile installers and finishers (24 percent)8. Sewing machine operators (23 percent)9. Construction laborers (21 percent)10. Grounds maintenance workers (20 percent)",

            "article_content": "The following script is from \"The 45th President,\" which aired on Nov. 13, 2016. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Rich Bonin and Ruth Streeter, producers. During what seemed an interminable campaign, a divided country found all kinds of ways to describe Donald Trump: visionary businessman, vulgar self-promoter, political neophyte. But after Tuesday, for all Americans, there's only one description that counts: president-elect. Since the election, demonstrations against him have broken out in over a dozen cities across the country.\u00a0 And people on both sides are on edge. What we discovered in Mr. Trump's first television interview as president-elect, was that some of his signature issues at the heart of his campaign were not meant to be taken literally, but as opening bids for negotiation.  Tonight, you will also hear from his family about whether they'll play roles in a Trump presidency. But we begin with President-elect Trump, whom we interviewed Friday in his penthouse home in the Trump Tower. Lesley Stahl: Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump. Donald Trump: Thank you. Lesley Stahl: You're president-elect. Donald Trump: Thank you. Lesley Stahl: How surprised were you? Donald Trump: Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I really-- I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven and-- Lesley Stahl: But everyone thought you were going to lose. Donald Trump: I know, I did my final speech in Michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31,000 people, many people outside of the arena. And I felt-- when I left, I said, \"How are we gonna lose?\" We set it up a day before. And we had all of these people. And it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and I said, \"This doesn't look like second place.\" So we were really happy, I mean, it was-- these are great people. Lesley Stahl: On election night, I heard you went completely silent. Was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you? \u00a0Donald Trump: I think so, it's enormous. I've done a lotta big things, I've never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so-- it's so enormous, it's so amazing. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: It kind of just took your breath away? Couldn't talk? Donald Trump: A li-- a little bit, a little bit. And I think-- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now. Lesley Stahl: Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call. Donald Trump: So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn't have been nicer. She just said, \"Congratulations, Donald, well done.\" And I said, \"I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor.\" She is very strong and very smart. Lesley Stahl: What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him? Donald Trump: He did, he called the next day. Lesley Stahl: Really? What did he say? Donald Trump: He actually called last night. Lesley Stahl: What did he say? Donald Trump: And he-- he couldn't have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he's ever seen. Lesley Stahl: He said that. Donald Trump: He was very, very-- really, very nice. Lesley Stahl: It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her? Donald Trump: Well, it was a double-side nasty. Donald Trump: I mean they were tough and I was tough and-- do I regret? I mean, I'm sitting here with you now and we're gonna do a great job for the country. We're going to make America great again, I mean, that's what-- it-- it began with that and that's where we are right now. There are so many-- Lesley Stahl: So no-- no regrets about-- Donald Trump: I can't regret. No-- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say. But-- but I will say that-- it really-- it really is something that I'm very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign. Lesley Stahl: Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama? Donald Trump: Sure. Lesley Stahl: 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15? Donald Trump: 15 max.  [Barack Obama: We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy.] Donald Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was-- just-- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me-- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now-- Lesley Stahl: Like what? Donald Trump: Well\u2026 Lesley Stahl: Give us some meat. Donald Trump:\u00a0 Well, look I don't want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that's tough. It's a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view. Lesley Stahl: Uh-huh. Donald Trump: And I like having that because I'm going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects. Donald Trump:\u2013and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But-- Lesley Stahl: Like-- Donald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation. Lesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it. Donald Trump: Well, he didn't ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.  Lesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or-- Donald Trump: No, I think I'm a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I'm not. I'm actually not. I'm a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found\u2014it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting. [Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.] Lesley Stahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you've said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you're-- unqualified-- Donald Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like? Lesley Stahl: Yeah. Donald Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other\u2014 Lesley Stahl: There was no awkwardness? Donald Trump: I'll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that's strange. I'm actually surprised to tell you that. It's-- you know, a little bit strange. [Donald Trump: Thank you, sir.] Lesley Stahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency? Donald Trump: No, I think it's a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They've let 'em down on the job front. They've even let 'em down in terms of the war front. You know, we've been fighting this war for 15 years-- Lesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign. Donald Trump: We've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what's been taking place over a longer period of time than that. Lesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president? Donald Trump: You know, I'll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it's going to be America first. It's not going to be what we're doing\u2014we, we've lost-- we're losing this country. We're losing this country. That's why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in? \u00a0Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don't want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.  Lesley Stahl: Can you be? Donald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that's easier. Honestly to do that, it's easier. Lesley Stahl: So let's go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you're going to do what you said or you're going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall? \u00a0Donald Trump: Yes. Lesley Stahl: They're talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence? Donald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I'm very good at this, it's called construction. Lesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence? Donald Trump: Yeah, it could be \u2013 it could be some fencing. Lesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants? Donald Trump: \u00a0What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it's very important, we want to secure our border. [Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.] Lesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away? Donald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We're going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes-- Lesley Stahl: And you've got both Houses? Donald Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things-- Lesley Stahl: You can do things lickety-split. Donald Trump: It's been a long time since it's happened. Donald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don't forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed. Lesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money. Donald Trump: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team\u2014 Donald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that? \u00a0Donald Trump: I don't like it, no. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: You don't like it, but your own transition team, it's filled with lobbyists. \u00a0Donald Trump: That's the only people you have down there. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby. Donald Trump: Sure. Everybody's a lobbyist down there--  \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Well, wait \u00a0Donald Trump: That's what they are. They're lobbyists or special interests\u2014 Lesley Stahl: On your own transition team. \u00a0Donald Trump:\u2013we are trying to clean up Washington. Look-- \u00a0Lesley Stahl: How can you claim-- \u00a0Donald Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that's the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we're going to clean it up. We're having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits. We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist. Lesley Stahl: But you're, but you're basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them? Donald Trump: I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out. You have to phase it out. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Let's talk about your cabinet. \u00a0Donald Trump: OK. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions? \u00a0Donald Trump: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Tell us. Donald Trump: Well, I can't tell you that, but I have made-- Lesley Stahl: Oh, come on\u2014 Donald Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I've spoken to many of them and I'll call the rest of them, but and I said, \"Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is.\" France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia\u2014and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country.  Lesley Stahl: One of the things you're going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you'll do that quickly? Donald Trump: Yes. Very important. Lesley Stahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade? Donald Trump: So look, here's what's going to happen-- I'm going to-- I'm pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They'll be very\u2014 Lesley Stahl: But what about overturning this law-- Donald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They'll be pro-life, they'll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody's talking about the Second Amendment and they're trying to dice it up and change it, they're going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and-- \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women won't be able to get an abortion? \u00a0Donald Trump: No, it'll go back to the states. Lesley Stahl: By state\u2014no some -- \u00a0Donald Trump: Yeah. \u00a0Donald Trump: Yeah, well, they'll perhaps have to go, they'll have to go to another state. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: And that's OK? Donald Trump: Well, we'll see what happens. It's got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you're taking on? \u00a0Donald Trump: No. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Not at all? \u00a0Donald Trump: I respect it. But I'm not scared by it. Lesley Stahl: Now you're not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric-- Donald Trump: That's only because they don't know me. I really believe that's only because-- Lesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that's-- Donald Trump: I just don't think they know me. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think they're demonstrating against? Donald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had-- \u00a0Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are\u2014 \u00a0Donald Trump: Well Lesley\u2014 \u00a0Lesley Stahl: are professional? \u00a0Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah-- Lesley Stahl: OK, but what about \u2013 they're in every city. Lesley Stahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don't you say to yourself, I guess you don't, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They're afraid. \u00a0Donald Trump: I would tell them don't be afraid, absolutely. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: But that's not what you're saying, I said it- \u00a0Donald Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, I've been saying it. \u00a0Lesley Stahl: OK. Donald Trump: Don't be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don't be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, \"Oh, that's a terrible thing.\" And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here. It has been five full days since the election and anti-Trump demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clinton's edge in the popular vote, have been significant. When we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name\u2026 or against his supporters.\u00a0  Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters. Donald Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that-- Lesley Stahl: But you do hear it? Donald Trump: I don't hear it\u2014I saw, I saw one or two instances\u2026 Lesley Stahl: On social media? Donald Trump: But I think it's a very small amount. Again, I think it's-- Lesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people? Donald Trump: I would say don't do it, that's terrible, 'cause I'm gonna bring this country together.  \u00a0Lesley Stahl: They're harassing Latinos, Muslims-- Donald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \"Stop it.\" If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.  During the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton's email issue. So we asked him if he plans to carry that out. That part of the interview and a discussion with the next first lady, Melania Trump, when we come back. On Friday, Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team. Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump also added his three older children to the transition team.\u00a0 Between now and Inauguration Day, the team must fill the new administration with 4,000 political appointees. That's 4,000 new hires in just nine weeks. When we talked to Donald Trump on Friday, the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in.\u00a0 He was subdued.\u00a0 We wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric, lower the flame. Lesley Stahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators. Donald Trump: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: You said that they were professionals\u2014and you said it was unfair. Donald Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are -- Lesley Stahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you're upset about just put out there when you're president? Donald Trump: So it's a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people-- Lesley Stahl: So you are going to keep it up? Donald Trump: It's a great form of communication. Now, do I say I'll give it up entirely and throw out, that's a tremendous form-- I pick up-- I'm picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I'm not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, 'cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That's very tough-- Lesley Stahl: But you're going to do that as president? Donald Trump: I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's-- it's where it's at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that. Lesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail? Donald Trump: Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do, I'm going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we've been talking about. Lesley Stahl: You-- you know, you-- Donald Trump: And get the country straightened away. Lesley Stahl: You called her \"crooked Hillary,\" said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, \"Lock em' up.\" Donald Trump: Yeah. She did-- Lesley Stahl: Do you\u2014 Donald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things-- Lesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might\u2026 Donald Trump: I don't want to hurt them. I don't want to hurt them. They're, they're good people. I don't want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together. With that\u2026 [Donald Trump: You look great, honey.] We were joined by the next first lady, Melania Trump. She'll be only the second foreign-born first lady. She's from Slovenia. John Quincy Adams' wife Louisa was the first.\u00a0  Lesley Stahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You're about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little-- Melania Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it's-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- it's-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I'm very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart. Lesley Stahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she's going to be? Donald Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she's very warm. And I think she'll have a platform where she'll really be able to do a lot of good. And that's what she wants to do. Lesley Stahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you've already said you're interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.  Melania Trump: I think it's very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way. It's an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign. Lesley Stahl: What about your husband's tweeting? Melania Trump: Well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following. Lesley Stahl: So you never say to him, \"Come on\"? Melania Trump: I did. Donald Trump: She does-- Melania Trump: I-- Melania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But\u2026 Lesley Stahl: Does he listen to you? Melania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn't-- Donald Trump: I'm not a big tweeter. I mean, I don't do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across. Lesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him? Melania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time.  Lesley Stahl: All the time? Melania Trump: All the time. Lesley Stahl: And does-- Melania Trump: And-- Lesley Stahl: --he listen? Does he-- Melania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He's an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it. Lesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval? Donald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he's affected every bit as much. Maybe more. Lesley Stahl: Maybe more. Donald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, \"I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job.\" And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.  Lesley Stahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10? Melania Trump: 10. Lesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know? Melania Trump: He knows. He knows-- Lesley Stahl: He knows? Melania Trump: --what's going on. And, he's very proud of his dad. Lesley Stahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given-- Melania Trump: No. Lesley Stahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign? Melania Trump: No. I didn't feel it. Lesley Stahl: Not at all? Melania Trump: No. Lesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting. Melania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice. Lesley Stahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That's an enormous help. Your parents are here, right? Melania Trump: They're here. Lesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you? Melania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that. Lesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair's out of place. Are you both prepared for this? Melania Trump: We are used to it. Donald Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, 'cause I've had a lot. But I've never had anything like this. Lesley Stahl: You won't be able to walk down the street-- Melania Trump: I didn't do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It's another level, but it will continue. At that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces. Lesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation? Donald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don't-- I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think -- Lesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much? Donald Trump: Well, there's been a lotta leaking, there's no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I'd answer a question like that. Lesley Stahl: Sounds like you're not sure. Donald Trump: Well, sure, I'm not sure. I'd wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did. Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns? Donald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I'm under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn't care because I won the election very easily. So they don't care. I never thought they did care.  Lesley Stahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy.  Donald Trump: I do. Lesley Stahl: So do you still think it's rigged? Donald Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College. Lesley Stahl: Exactly.But do you think-- Donald Trump: You know, it's-- Lesley Stahl: --it's rigged? Donald Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated-- Lesley Stahl: Even though you won you're saying that-- Donald Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I'm not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There's a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there's something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system. Lesley Stahl: What about vacations? You're not going to take any vacations? You've said that. Donald Trump: We have so much work. There's so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We're lowering taxes, we're taking care of health care. I mean, there's just so much to be done. So I don't think we'll be very big on vacations, no.  Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president's salary? Donald Trump: Well, I've never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I'll take $1 a year. But it's a -- I don't even know what it is. Donald Trump: Do you know what the salary is? Lesley Stahl: $400,000 you're giving up.  Donald Trump: No, I'm not gonna take the salary. I'm not taking it.  In a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and ISIS. On Tuesday, Donald Trump reached deep into America's ranks of the discouraged and neglected, a largely white constituency.\u00a0 They feel their America hasn't been great for a long time. And they accepted a promise to make it great again. But Mr. Trump's appeal wasn't just to the disaffected. A map on election night was a sea of red, as he won support across the traditionally Republican South, but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the Midwest. Hillary Clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs, among minorities and especially women.\u00a0 Just 51 percent of college-educated white women voted to make her the first female president.\u00a0 Her base didn't come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off Donald Trump's new and energized coalition. On Friday Mr. Trump's four older children \u2013 Tiffany, Donald, Jr., Eric And Ivanka -- joined us to talk about their father's surprising victory. Lesley Stahl: Set the scene. It's election night. Your father-- no one's expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you. Tell us about being in that room.  Eric Trump: You start to see the states falling. You start seeing Florida come in and he was declared the winner. And then you saw Ohio, you saw North Carolina. You saw Pennsylvania. You saw Wisconsin. I mean, you saw all these great states \u2013 they're all falling. And I think it was when we got Pennsylvania that we knew. And it was amazing. We were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family. And I actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention. So-- Lesley Stahl: He went quiet is what I heard. Eric Trump: --it's-- it's-- Lesley Stahl: --is what I heard. Eric Trump: --it's a moment I'll never forget, I can tell you that. I mean, the team was around and everybody's cheering. And it was just-- it was-- it was a beautiful night.  Ivanka Trump: It is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the United States of America. We had enormous pride, joy. It's incredibly exciting. And we're very grateful for the opportunity. And we take that opportunity very seriously. Lesley Stahl: Tiffany? Tiffany Trump: I mean I don't think we can really prepare for our father becoming president. But we were all there together with everyone that's worked so hard. And my dad has worked so hard. And it's just \u2013 it's really awe-inspiring. At some point that night and into the next day, calls from well-wishers started pouring in \u2013 including, Mr. Trump told us, from both ex-presidents Bush. Neither of whom supported him in the campaign.  Lesley Stahl: What did the b=Bushes say when they called you? Donald Trump: Well, it was very interesting. I got a call from Father Bush, who is a wonderful man. And he just said, \"Congratulations. It was an amazing campaign.\" And then I got a call from George and he said-- \"Congratulations. It was great.\" \u00a0And, you know, look, it's-- it's a tough situation. I went to war with Jeb. And Jeb's a nice guy, but it was a nasty campaign. It was a nasty campaign. And, I mean, I'm disappointed in one thing. He signed a pledge and I don't know how you sign a pledge and then you don't honor it. It was a rough primary. It's a rough primary. Although I think the general was probably just as tough. Probably as a combination, it was the roughest ever. Lesley Stahl: Ivanka, you said that your father's changed in the campaign. How has he changed? Ivanka Trump: I think it's impossible to go through this journey and not change for the better. You meet-- and in my father's case, literally millions of Americans, and they speak to you with a candor about their struggles, their challenges. They share with you their most intimate stories. So you connect with people in a different way. And you grow. Lesley Stahl: Do you think your father's changed? Eric Trump: I think as a family, we've changed, to tell you the truth. I mean, how big this platform is, is incredible. And I have to say, one of the most rewarding things of my life, and I can speak on behalf of really all of us, it's fighting by our father's side every single day as you've gone through a grueling, grueling process like this. Lesley Stahl: Don, did you discover something about your father that you didn't know before? Donald Trump, Jr.: You know-- we-- we know him pretty well. And we've got to, you know, be by his side for many years, both as a father and in business. So, you know-- the tenacity that he's always shown-- was just there. But it was just so much more. When I was watching him working 20-hour days, doing seven major speeches to tens of thousands of people and just saying, \"Well, it wasn't triage. Which state are we gonna do today,\" it's, \"We're just gonna do 'em all. We're gonna speak to all of these people.\" And I think people saw that energy. They fed off that energy. That energy was so much of the movement-- that he was able to create. And, you know-- it-- it only furthered what I already knew. Lesley Stahl: I want to ask you all about something that's going on right now around the country. A lot of people are afraid. They're really afraid. African Americans think there's a target on their back. Muslims are terrified. Donald Trump: I think it's horrible if that's happening. I think it's built up by the press because, frankly, they'll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could've been there before. If I weren't even around doing this, and they'll make into an event because that's the way the press is. Lesley Stahl: Do any of you want to say anything about this fear that's out there? Donald Trump, Jr.: I-- I think the fears, you know, while they may be there, some fabricated, some not-- are totally unfounded.  Lesley Stahl: One of the groups that's expressing fear are the LGBTQ group. You-- Donald Trump: And yet I mentioned them at the Republican National Convention. And-- Lesley Stahl: You did. Donald Trump: Everybody said, \"That was so great.\" I have been, you know, I've been-a supporter. Lesley Stahl: Well, I guess the issue for them is marriage equality. Do you support marriage equality? Donald Trump: It-- it's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it's done. Lesley Stahl: So even if you appoint a judge that-- Donald Trump: It's done. It-- you have-- these cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They've been settled. And, I'm fine with that. Lesley Stahl: One of the issues that has come up in the campaign is your father's temperament. And he has himself has said, \"If someone insults me or says something unkind about me, I'm gonna strike back.\" And now people are saying, \"Well, maybe he should kinda soften that, control that a little.\" What-- how do you think he's going to comport himself as president? Eric Trump: I think very presidential. At the same time, my father, if he needs to be a fighter, he can be a fighter. And I think this country, quite frankly, needs a fighter. And I think that's what this country elected. Donald Trump: They spent $1 billion against me on the word \"Temperament.\" It was given by Madison Avenue. And they thought that, by temperament, they could maybe, you know, win the election. Obviously, it didn't work because we're here and they're not. And I think my strongest asset is my temperament because I have a temperament where we win and we're going to start winning again. We're going to win on trade, we're going to win at the borders, we're going to knock out ISIS. Lesley Stahl: You have said that you're gonna destroy ISIS. Now, how are you going to? Donald Trump: I don't tell you that. I don't tell you that. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what can -- Donald Trump: I'm not like the people going in right now and fighting Mosul and they announced it four months before they went into Mosul and everybody now is -- it's a tough fight because, number one, the people from the --leaders of ISIS have left. What do you-- why do I have to tell you that? Lesley Stahl: Troops on the ground? Donald Trump: I'm not gonna say anything. I don't want to tell them anything. I don't want to tell anybody anything. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what about\u2014the American people. Donald Trump: I wanna do the job. We have some great generals. We have great generals.  Lesley Stahl: You said you knew more than the generals about ISIS Donald Trump: Well, I'll be honest with you, I probably do because look at the job they've done. OK, look at the job they've done. They haven't done the job. Now, maybe it's leadership, maybe it's something else. Who knows? All I can tell you is we're going to get rid of ISIS.  Lesley Stahl: Let me ask you about Obamacare, which you say you're going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered? Donald Trump: Yes. Because it happens to be one of the strongest assets. Lesley Stahl: You're going to keep that? Donald Trump: Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period, we're gonna-- Lesley Stahl: You're gonna keep that-- Donald Trump: Very much try and keep that. Adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep. Lesley Stahl: And there's going to be a period if you repeal it and before you replace it, when millions of people could lose -\u2013 no? Donald Trump: No, we're going to do it simultaneously. It'll be just fine. We're not going to have, like, a two-day period and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. And we'll know. And it'll be great health care for much less money. So it'll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination. Lesley Stahl: Roles during the administration. Any of you want a job in your father's administration? Eric Trump: So we have an amazing company. You know, one of, I think, the fortunate things for my father and our father is that he was able to step out of the company to run for commander-in-chief. And I think he's going to rely on us more than ever. And-- Lesley Stahl: So you'll stay up here? Eric Trump: So we'll-- we'll-- we'll be in New York and we'll take care of the business. I think we're going to have a lot of fun doing it. And we're going to make him very proud. Lesley Stahl: People think that you're going to be part of the administration, Ivanka. Ivanka Trump: I'm-- no. I'm going to be a daughter. But I've-- I've said throughout the campaign that I am very passionate about certain issues. And that I want to fight for them. Lesley Stahl: But you won't be inside-- Ivanka Trump: Wage equality, childcare. These are things that are very important for me. I'm very passionate about education. Really promoting more opportunities for women. So you know, there're a lot of things that I feel deeply, strongly about. But not in a formal administrative capacity. Lesley Stahl: Let me ask whether any of you think that the campaign has hurt the Trump brand. Ivanka Trump: I don't think it matters. This is so much more important. And more serious. And-- so th-- I-- I-- you know, that's the focus. Donald Trump: I think what Ivanka trying to say, \"Who cares? Who cares?\" This is big league stuff. This is-- this is our country. Our country is going bad. We're going to save our country. I don't care about hotel occupancy. It's peanuts compared to what we're doing. Health care, making people better. It's unfair what's happened to the people of our country and we're going to change it. As simple as that.

            "article_content": "LONDON -- Europe\u2019s leaders are not expecting a smooth ride in 2017 following a year marked by political upheaval, extremist attacks, unchecked immigration, and a rising military threat from Russia.\u00a0 Britain is suing for divorce, the\u00a0far-right is on the march, some former Soviet satellites seem disillusioned with the West even as Russia seeks to regain its influence, and America will soon inaugurate an untested, seemingly Russia-friendly president who has voiced doubts about the usefulness of the NATO alliance. The uncertainty is thick enough to breathe.  It all looks so different from the triumphant panorama presented more than two decades ago when the European Union was expanding. Formerly captive nations freed from Soviet control seemed eager to embrace liberal democracy, capitalism - and substantial subsidies - from their wealthier neighbors.  There was rosy talk of an ever-closer union, the development of a single currency, and a cooperative relationship with Russia. It hasn\u2019t turned out that way - the EU, with its touted ideals of shared democratic values and free movement of people, has never seemed so frayed and vulnerable.\u00a0 \u201cThe risks for 2017 remain very high,\u201d said Adam Thomson, director of the London-based European Leadership Network research group. \u201cWe Europeans need to recognize that we face a level of risk in the West-Russian confrontation that we have not seen since the 1960s. It is partly because a lot of the security rules of the road have been torn up or suspended, so there are fewer rules and less predictability.\u201d  He said most Europeans do not perceive the danger because they have been lulled by the cordial East-West relations that prevailed for years after the Soviet collapse in 1991.  \u201cEuropeans have gotten used to 25 years of peace dividend, and a stability they have come to think of as normal but in fact might be the abnormality in Europe\u2019s long history of conflict,\u201d Thomson said.  There is deep unease in the Baltics, Scandinavia and elsewhere as Russia moves more military forces to its border regions and even places nuclear capable Iskander ballistic missiles into the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, where they can threaten part of Poland, Germany, and other countries.  Russian President Vladimir Putin seems emboldened by the lukewarm international response to his government\u2019s annexation of the Crimea two years ago and his strong intervention in Syria this year - and by the growing support he enjoys among far-right political leaders who are gaining ground in Europe.  He has already been making inroads, with a pro-Russia candidate elected president in Moldova and a candidate calling for a European rapprochement with Russia winning in Bulgaria.\u00a0 Electoral focal points in the coming year are France, where voters may bring to power a far-right National Front government that wants to follow Britain out of the European Union, and Germany and the Netherlands, where far-right parties also stand to make gains.  The increasing appeal of the far-right has been fueled by public unhappiness with the ongoing influx of migrants, mostly from the Middle East and Africa. Events like the recent extremist attack that killed 12 people at a Christmas market in Berlin - combined with earlier assaults on civilians in Paris and Brussels - have made it more common for Europeans to view the incoming human tide as a potential threat.  The coming year will determine whether\u00a0Britain\u2019s surprise decision in a June referendum to walk away from the many benefits of EU membership in favor of establishing firm border controls was an anomaly or a harbinger of things to come.  Elections in the Netherlands in March are expected to bring strong gains for Geert Wilders\u2019 anti-Islam, anti-EU Party for Freedom, which could emerge as the biggest party. Even if that happens, he will likely find it very difficult to find enough partners to form a majority government in a country where coalitions are the norm due to the voting system and proliferation of smaller parties.  Wilders\u2019 outspoken opposition to Islam has gained traction in a nation long known for its tolerance. He wants the Netherlands, a founding member of the EU, to leave the 28-nation bloc.  The first round of French voting in April is expected to bring far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen into the final round against conservative Francois Fillon.  Both pose a threat to the European status quo: Le Pen wants to take France out of the EU, end its use of the shared euro currency, and close the border-free zone. Both candidates favor closer ties to Russia, including a lifting of sanctions. Both want to reduce immigration and strengthen border controls, though Fillon prefers to do so from within the EU bloc.\u00a0 German elections expected in September are likely to bring the nationalist Alternative for Germany party into the federal parliament for the first time. The party\u2019s strength, stemming from dissatisfaction at the influx of migrants to Germany over the past two years, has put Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s center-right Christian Democrats on the defensive - particularly after the Christmas market truck attack, apparently carried out by an asylum-seeker from Tunisia.  Some experts believe a Le Pen triumph in the final round in France in May would deal a fatal blow to the EU.  \u201cFrance is the critical one,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe research group.  \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll win, but if she does I think it would probably mean the end of the EU because she would start to challenge the authority of EU law,\u201d he said. \u201cShe would ignore laws she doesn\u2019t like, unilaterally start to impose border checks, and the sheer fragility of the EU would be brought into sharp relief. People don\u2019t understand how fragile it is.\u201d ",

            "article_content": "\u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor Scott Pelley spoke with Vice President-elect Mike Pence in an exclusive interview after Pence and President-elect Donald Trump announced a deal with Carrier to keep 800 manufacturing jobs in Indiana that were slated to go to Mexico. About 1,300 other Carrier jobs will still be moved to Mexico. Pelley also asked Pence about Trump\u2019s seeming reversal on some campaign promises, including a vow to deport 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally. Watch an extended version of the interview above.\u00a0 SCOTT PELLEY: Mr. Vice-President-elect, you\u2019re there at the Carrier plant. Earlier today, the president-elect said that companies would no longer be allowed to leave the United States without consequences. What are the consequences? MIKE PENCE: Well, I think, first and foremost what the president-elect has made clear is that we\u2019re simply going to improve the environment in America for job creators and for businesses. We\u2019re going to lower taxes. We\u2019re going to roll back the kind of regulations that, frankly -- we\u2019re placing a crushing weight on Carrier here in Indiana and literally was responsible for driving them out of this country. The president was able to reach out to their parent company, United Technologies, tell the story of his vision -- to make this country more competitive and more attractive for jobs and for businesses. And the announcement today, I think, is just the beginning of many good days, where businesses are going to recognize that change is coming. Help is on the way. And the best place to grow jobs and create opportunities is right here, in the United States. PELLEY: When Mr. Trump talks about consequences, are we talking about punitive taxes? PENCE:\u00a0I think \u2026 everything is really on the table as we negotiate trade deals going forward, as we renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. I think what the American people can anticipate that the Trump administration is going to roll our sleeves up. And we\u2019re going to drive a hard bargain. Look the, the American worker has been losing -- for decades now. We\u2019ve seen manufacturing in decline here in the industrial Midwest. Today\u2019s announcement here at Carrier, I think, gives hopes to millions of Americans that they now are going to have a president, after January 20th, who\u2019s going to fight for manufacturing jobs, going to negotiate deals that put American workers and American jobs first. And we\u2019re going to use all the tools that are available to make sure that we create a more attractive environment for business in the United States, less taxes for businesses and individuals, less regulations that are stifling jobs and growth, repealing and replacing Obamacare that\u2019s stifling growth in our economy. But it also means we\u2019re going to have policies in trade that really do protect the American economy. PELLEY: Now, Carrier tells us that you have saved 800 jobs that were headed to Mexico. How did you do it? PENCE:\u00a0Well, it all began with a phone call, by President-elect Donald Trump, almost about a week to the day after the election. He picked up the phone. He called the chairman of the parent company and just asked them to reconsider their decision to move jobs to Mexico from here in the state of Indiana. And he shared our vision for less taxes on businesses, to roll back the avalanche of regulations that\u2019s been stifling companies like Carrier, driving them out of our country. And I, I just couldn\u2019t be more grateful. PELLEY: But not to put too fine a point on it, sir, 1,300 jobs are still going to Mexico. And I wonder, why were you not able to save those? PENCE:\u00a0This change in, in their business policies was set into motion many months before he even secured the nomination. But I think what the American people have seen here is that, that they\u2019re going to have a president, after January 20th, the likes of which they\u2019re already seeing in a president-elect who\u2019s going to roll his sleeves up. And he\u2019s going to fight for American jobs. And I have to tell you, Scott, the fact that Carrier was set at this factory to go to zero jobs and now, we have more than 1,100 good-paying jobs here in the state of Indiana with the opportunity for that to grow, I think, is welcome news. And I will say to you, I think it\u2019s just the beginning, of a real revival of manufacturing all across the heartland and all across the United States of America. PELLEY: Just since the election, President-elect Trump has reversed himself on prosecuting Hillary Clinton and on deporting 11 million illegal immigrants in this country. Did he just say those things to get elected? Did he never intend to do them? PENCE: I think what the American people know they have in President-elect Donald Trump is someone who speaks straight from his mind and straight from his heart. And on the issue of illegal immigration, I promise you, as we were meeting yesterday on Capitol Hill with leaders of the House and Senate, we\u2019re going to go straight to work after this Congress convenes and this administration takes office. And we\u2019re going to pass policies that will end illegal immigration in this country. PELLEY: But he made these promises. And now, he\u2019s reversed himself. And I wonder, what does that tell us about Donald Trump? PENCE: Well, I think, I think what it tells you about Donald Trump, in both cases, that he\u2019s always going to tell the American people where he stands. And, make no mistake about it. There\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s been no change in the policy about ending illegal immigration in this country. PELLEY: The speaker of the House told us today that, when it comes to deporting 11 million illegal immigrants, it\u2019s not going to happen, and he won\u2019t fund it. PENCE: I promise you that, that we\u2019re going to get a tremendous amount of support, from members on Capitol Hill for border security, for strengthening internal enforcement, expanding our border agents, expanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement, identifying and prioritizing, the removal from this country of criminal illegal aliens, those who\u2019ve overstayed their visas. I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019ll have broad-based support in the Congress for what the president-elect outlined in the course of his campaign. And we\u2019re going to work every day to make sure that we advance those policies and end illegal immigration once and for all. PELLEY: Vice President-elect Mike Pence, also governor of Indiana until January 20th, we thank you very much for your time. You\u2019ve made a big difference...\u00a0in your home state there. Thank you very much again. PENCE: Thank you, Scott.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Trump has offered Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions the post of attorney general, sources directly involved in the selection process tell CBS News. Sessions has been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest and most consistent allies, and he was the first senator to announce his support for the president-elect. An architect of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration, counterterrorism and trade policies, Sessions was also considered for secretary of defense. The Trump transition team pronounced itself \u201cunbelievably impressed\u201d with Sessions in a statement, citing his work as a U.S. attorney and state attorney general in Alabama. Appointing him the nation\u2019s top prosecutor is sure to be controversial, though. Trump transition to the White House - live blog He\u2019s been through the Senate confirmation process before, with mixed success. \u00a0And confirming the four-term lawmaker this time around, even in a Republican-controlled chamber, is not guaranteed. \u00a0He did make it through a Republican-controlled Senate in 1981, when they approved him to be the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. But then, nominated for a federal judgeship in 1986, Sessions, R-Ala., was dogged by racist comments he was accused of making while serving as U.S. attorney. \u00a0A black assistant U.S. attorney accused Sessions of having addressed him as \u201cboy,\u201d and that he condemned the NAACP as \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ccommunist-inspired.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMr. Sessions is a throwback to a shameful era, which I know both black and white Americans thought was in our past,\u201d the late Massachusetts Democrat, Sen. Edward Kennedy, said during the 1986 confirmation hearing. \u201cIt is inconceivable to me that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a U.S. attorney, let alone a U.S. federal judge.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0  During the hearing, a former assistant U.S. attorney, Thomas Figures, who is black, said Sessions referred to him as \u201cboy,\u201d and told him to be careful what he said to \u201cwhite folks.\u201d Sessions said he never called Figures \u201cboy,\u201d but Kennedy produced a letter from an organization of black lawyers that said Figures made the allegation about Sessions to the organization\u2019s investigators at least twice. \u00a0 \u00a0  Sessions told the committee that he told Figures to be careful what he said to \u201cfolks.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cI believe that the statements and actions of Mr. Sessions regarding race, and regarding civil rights, impact tremendously on whether he is decent,\u201d Figures told the committee. Figures died in 2015. \u00a0 \u00a0  Sessions was also criticized for joking in the presence of an attorney with the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division that the Ku Klux Klan was \u201cOK\u201d until he learned they smoked marijuana. During his confirmation hearing, he said his comment about the Klan \u201cwas a silly comment, I guess you might say, that I made.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0  Sessions told the committee he made the joke while his office was investigating the 1981 murder of Michael Donald, a black man who was kidnapped, beaten and killed by two Klansmen who slit his throat and then hanged his body in a tree in Mobile, Alabama. The two men were later arrested and convicted. \u00a0 \u00a0  Sessions said he never meant the joke to suggest he supported the Klan. He said the joke was intended to convey that he thought it was \u201cbizarre\u201d that Klansmen had smoked marijuana after one of their meetings. \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cAll of us understood that the Klan is a force for hatred and bigotry and it just could not have meant anything else than that under those circumstances,\u201d Sessions said, noting that he had been involved in the decision to try one of the killers in state court so he could face the death penalty. \u00a0 \u00a0  Sessions\u2019 spokesman said the senator was unavailable to be interviewed for this story. \u00a0 \u00a0  Barry Kowalski, a former Justice Department attorney who was in Mobile, working with Sessions on the Donald case, said he was there for the so-called joke about the Klan, and he did not interpret it as a racist comment. He said it was a joke. \u201cThat was totally hospital room humor,\u201d Kowalski told the AP Thursday. \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cI can only speak from what I saw,\u201d Kowalski said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have been more supportive of making sure we got convicted the murderers of the last black man who was lynched by the Klan.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0  Gerry Hebert, another former Justice Department attorney who had worked with Sessions in the early 1980s, told the Judiciary committee about racist comments Sessions made regarding the NAACP being un-American and said Sessions agreed with another person\u2019s comment that a prominent white civil rights lawyer was a disgrace to his race for trying voting rights cases. \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cI filed all these things away thinking, \u2018God, what a racist this guy is,\u2019\u201d Hebert told The Associated Press. \u00a0 \u00a0  During Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearing, then-Sen. Joe Biden asked Hebert if he would be comfortable trying a voting rights case before Sessions as a judge or whether he would ask that Sessions be recused because of racist comments he had made. \u201cI would certainly raise the issue, absolutely,\u201d Hebert responded. \u00a0 \u00a0  Most of the senators who voted against Sessions in 1986 are no longer alive or in office. Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy is the only one who voted against him still in the Senate. \u00a0 \u00a0  Today, Sessions would face confirmation as a member of the chamber. Senators often are deferential to current and former members who are nominated for Cabinet posts. The last time the Senate rejected one of its own was in 1989 when then-Sen. John G. Tower, a Texas Republican, could not get confirmed as President George H. W. Bush\u2019s defense secretary amid reports of heavy drinking and womanizing. \u00a0 \u00a0 Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearing could take place as early as January. The Republicans will have only a 52-48 advantage, assuming Republicans win an upcoming Senate election. That means Sessions can\u2019t afford to lose any votes from members of his own party. If there are Republicans upset by his comments - not just years ago about race but also what he has said in recent years about immigration - his confirmation could be a challenge. \u00a0 \u00a0  Sessions is an immigration hard-liner, not in step with mainstream Republicans. In the past year, he has supported mass deportations for immigrants in the country illegally, suggested that the administration quickly deport unaccompanied children and families who have been caught crossing the border illegally, linked terror attacks against the U.S. to Muslim immigrant families and complained that the Obama administration has increased the number of green cards issued to immigrants from \u201cMuslim-majority countries.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0  But South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would support a Sessions nomination. \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cI\u2019d vote for him. I like Jeff. He was the early, only supporter for Donald Trump in the Senate,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd I believe Jeff Sessions has earned the right to serve President Trump in the highest levels, and I think he\u2019s a good, competent, capable man.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0  Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, would also support Sessions, spokesman Conn Carroll said. \u201cSen. Lee has worked closely with Sessions in the Senate and has the utmost respect for his abilities,\u201d Carroll said. \u00a0 \u00a0  Sessions was asked by reporters at Trump Tower Thursday whether he thought he would be confirmed by the Senate. \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cPeople have to make that decision. The actual senators will cast those votes on any confirmation,\u201d Sessions said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who was just elected as the next ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement Friday that she is \u201ccommitted to a full and fair progress\u201d when lawmakers debate Sessions\u2019 nomination as attorney general next year. \u201cWhile many of us have worked with Senator Sessions closely and know him to be a staunch advocate for his beliefs, the process will remain the same: a fair and complete review of the nominee,\u201d Feinstein wrote. She added that the attorney general should be \u201cabove the political fray,\u201d is the person who has jurisdiction over many crucial laws and is in charge of overseeing immigration judges who will hear cases on applying for asylum status.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON, CBS HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION: New reports about Russia influencing the presidential election create a political firestorm and sour relations between the president-elect and the intelligence community.  President-elect Donald Trump took a break Saturday afternoon to take in an all-American classic, the Army-Navy game, but the news about Russia took some of the attention off the field.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  QUESTION: Do you trust the U.S. intel community?  DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: I do.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: But does he really? And will Mr. Trump join a bipartisan call for a wider investigation of Russian efforts? We will talk to the senator leading the charge for an investigation, John McCain, and also get his thoughts on the leading contender for secretary of state, Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson.  Top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway will be here.  And Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders also joins us.  Then we will hear about efforts to improve relations between the police and the community from South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.  Plus, plenty of political analysis and some thoughts about an American hero who died last week.  It is all ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I am John Dickerson.  New developments this morning. A bipartisan group of senators led by Senator John McCain have called for an investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. election, this after \u201cThe Washington Post\u201d reported the CIA had come to a new conclusion, that the Russians were actively working to elect Donald Trump.  Mr. Trump responded to \u201cThe Washington Post\u201d report in an interview that aired on \u201cFOX News Sunday.\u201d  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \u201cFOX NEWS SUNDAY\u201d)  TRUMP: I think it is ridiculous. I think it is just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t know why. And I think it is just -- you know, they talk about all sorts of things. Every week, it is another excuse. We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College. I guess final numbers are now at 306, and she is down to a very low number.  No, I don\u2019t believe that at all.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: And we begin this morning with Senator John McCain.  Senator McCain, you want an investigation, a bipartisan investigation. The president-elect says that this notion of Russians trying to be involved in the election is ridiculous.  What do you make of that disconnect?  SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I don\u2019t know what to make of it, because it is clear the Russians interfered.  Now, whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate, I think that is a subject of investigation.  But the facts are stubborn things. They did hack into this campaign. And they did it, I think, with some -- with at least what seemed to be effective. Sort of every week or so, there was new information. And were they hacking the Republicans the same way? The Republican National Committee?  And, if so, why didn\u2019t they -- there is a whole lot of issues out there. It requires an investigation. The president has ordered an investigation for the -- you are not going to find this all out in the next month between administrations. It is fine with me if he starts an investigation.  But it is going to require congressional involvement. It is going to require in-depth -- and, by the way, the Russians have interfered in a lot of other elections. The Russians have hacked into some of our most secret military information. The Russians have been active using as a tool as part of Vladimir Putin\u2019s ambition to regain Russian prominence and dominance in some parts of the world.  DICKERSON: So, your point is both there is specific evidence that points you to this conclusion, and then there is a broader pattern of behavior that the Russians have been a part of?  MCCAIN: And they have hacked. They have -- in the case of a little country called Estonia, they basically tried to cut -- shut down their economy for a while.  They have intervened -- here is a fundamental fact that -- and we may get to this later on. Vladimir Putin is a thug and a murderer and a killer and a KGB agent. He had Boris Nemtsov murdered in the shadow of the Kremlin. He has dismembered the Ukraine. He has now precision strikes by Russian aircraft on hospitals in Aleppo.  Let\u2019s call Vladimir Putin for what he is. Does that mean you don\u2019t deal with him or talk to him? Of course you talk to him. But you do it the same way that Ronald Reagan did. And that\u2019s from a position of strength.  And, by the way, the Congress of the United States is not acting very responsibly on that issue, which is the subject of another encounter with us -- between us.  DICKERSON: Based on what you heard the president-elect say about Russia, he doesn\u2019t seem to share your view of Russia.  And speaking about it plainly -- if speaking about it plainly is really the starting position in your case, then what do you say to the president-elect about his view of Russia?  MCCAIN: I say I hope that he will listen to people like General Mattis, for example, his appointee to the secretary of defense. I hope that he would call people that he respects and who the American people respect and get the facts.  The facts are there about Russian behavior, and Russian, not just hacking into the United States in the 2016 election campaign, but throughout the world. Vladimir Putin, and the Chinese, by the way, and other rogue states, view cyber as a form of warfare.  And, by the way, according to testimony of our chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others, that\u2019s the area, cyber, that we are not ahead, do not have an advantage over our adversaries, nor, by the way, does the Obama administration have a policy or a strategy in this whole issue of cyber-warfare.  DICKERSON: Well, in terms of this investigation into Russian efforts with the election, do you want a just regular old through the Senate investigation? Do you want a special commission? Do you want a select committee?  MCCAIN: I would like, in an ideal world, to have a select committee.  DICKERSON: And why is that important? Explain to people.  MCCAIN: But that would have -- I would want that to be -- that would be either a Senate -- the leaders of the Intelligence Committee, Foreign Relations, then Armed Services, obviously.  But that takes a long time. It takes a lot of negotiating, et cetera. So, on the Armed Services Committee -- by the way, I work very closely with Richard Burr, with Senator Cardin and Senator Corker. We work closely together.  But what we are going to do in the meantime is going to have a subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee. We are going to ask Senator Lindsey Graham, who is as smart as anybody on this issue, to be the chair, along with a really smart Democrat.  And we will go to work on it. We will go to work immediately, because the issue of cyber is not a static issue.  DICKERSON: But on this question of the election, you are trying to -- that would be part out of it? You have said you want it to be bipartisan.  The president-elect Trump says this is basically cooked up by the Democrats. How do you squeeze the politics out of this?  (CROSSTALK)  MCCAIN: Because I am confident -- Chuck Schumer -- in the statement we made this morning, Chuck Schumer said we would be working on a bipartisan basis.  You can\u2019t make this issue partisan. It is just -- it is too important. A fundamental of a democracy is a free and fair election. And, again, I am saying, they are doing this in other countries, not just this one.  So I am confident that we can address this in a bipartisan fashion.  DICKERSON: You are headed to the Balkans with Senator Lindsey Graham to do what?  MCCAIN: Yes.  DICKERSON: What message are you...  (CROSSTALK)  MCCAIN: To talk to them.  The message is that we will not abandon them. We understand the challenges that they face. We understand the cyber-attacks. We understand the threats and the bullying of Vladimir Putin. And we are a government that has a role to play for the Congress of the United States, as well as the president. And so...  DICKERSON: Are they more worried about -- because of this president\u2019s position on Putin?  MCCAIN: They are very worried.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about...  MCCAIN: But they aren\u2019t the only ones who are very worried.  DICKERSON: ... his potential nominee for secretary of state, Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson. What is your view?  MCCAIN: I don\u2019t know him. I believe that we should give every nominee of the president of the United States a fair hearing, because that is the result of elections, and elections have consequences.  But I just described my view of Vladimir Putin. And I think it is correct. And so I\u2019m...  DICKERSON: And you\u2019re worried he has ties to him?  MCCAIN: Maybe those ties are strictly commercial and got to do with his business in the oil business. Fine.  But we will give him a fair hearing. But is it a matter of concern? Certainly it should be a matter of concern. But I am sure, in a bipartisan way, he will get a fair hearing.  DICKERSON: But if it is a matter of concern, play that out for people. What...  MCCAIN: It is a matter of concern to me that he has such a close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin.  And, obviously, they have done enormous deals together, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat. But that is a matter of concern. We will give him his chance. That\u2019s what the confirmation process, that is what advise and consent is all about.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator John McCain, thanks so much for being with us.  MCCAIN: Thanks, John.  DICKERSON: And we turn now to Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to president-elect Trump. She is in Philadelphia this morning.  Good morning, Kellyanne.  KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: Good morning, John.  DICKERSON: Will Mr. Trump support a congressional investigation into question of Russia being involved in the election?  CONWAY: Well, the president-elect will not interfere in the legislative branch in that way.  But he has made very clear in an interview aired this morning on a different network, John, that he feels, A, there is a great deal of confusion, no on source -- no on-the-record sources coming to a very bright-line conclusion about what happened here, and that he thinks that people are trying to relitigate the election.  People like Senator McCain say that he has an interest in making sure that a foreign government hasn\u2019t tried to interfere with our electoral process. And I respect him enormously for saying that. But there are others who aren\u2019t so high-minded about cyber- security. This is the latest attempt. First, it was Jim Comey\u2019s fault. Then we are going to have a recount. Then it is the alt- right\u2019s fault. And now it\u2019s Russian interference.  And I would just tell you that there does seem to be a lack of certainty among some of these agencies, no on-the-source person. Maybe that\u2019s why congressional investigations are at hand.  DICKERSON: Right. So I guess that is the question. Since there is confusion, you said Mr. Trump won\u2019t get in the way of -- the executive branch.  Will he cooperate,to the extent it is ever required, with these investigations, bipartisan now, that have been called for to look into whether Russia was involved?  CONWAY: And how are you characterizing his cooperation?  DICKERSON: Well, who knows where the investigation may lead.  CONWAY: Right.  DICKERSON: But just in terms of gauging how seriously the president-elect takes this notion, leaving politics out of it, because you have now got senators on the Republican and the Democratic side saying this is worth looking into, if for no other reason than to clear up the confusion, does Mr. Trump, in the spirit of that, want to cooperate with such an investigation?  CONWAY: John, he has made very clear how he views this. I mean, we don\u2019t want anybody, any foreign government...  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: But he said it is ridiculous. That seems to be pretty critical of the idea that it is worth looking into.  CONWAY: But let\u2019s be fair to him.  What president-elect Trump said is ridiculous is this idea that it was meant to help him become president of the United States. So there is no evidence of that. And if you go back and you listen to Clinton campaign spokespeople on your program and others, if you listen to their private briefings to media and others, they said very little about this.  They were talking about -- they were talking about how they were going to win the election before Election Day because of the early voting. False. They were going to have record turnout. If that were true, we would have won. And we did win.  So, I think the president-elect\u2019s point is that the conclusions all are making, some are making here that the interference went to affecting the election results to try to defeat Hillary Clinton, that is what he is calling ridiculous. And let me just point out, because I think it got muddied here a little bit, the RNC has a great source in its chairman, Reince Priebus, who also happens to the incoming chief of staff. He has denied again and again and again that the RNC was hacked. They obviously dealt with the FBI and other agencies.  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: Before we go off on that track, can I just keep us on the rails here for just a second, because we are not really talking about the RNC at the moment?  I just -- on this question of intelligence here, not talking about the election, but what bipartisan senators have now called for, is what I am trying to figure out here.  Mr. Trump has had several briefings as a candidate and now as president-elect. What is his feeling about the intelligence community?  CONWAY: He answered that question. I think you are going to show a clip later. I saw it in the beginning of your program, John, where he was asked, do you have faith in the intelligence community? And he said, \u201cI do.\u201d  So there is your answer from him. He appreciates these briefings, but let me make very clear that even me as a close adviser and many others with whom you will be speaking about this do not have access to those top-secret briefings. We don\u2019t have that type of clearance, nor should we.  And so he needs to not -- he is not divulging the information that he has, nor should he.  DICKERSON: Sure. The reason I ask is...  CONWAY: So, I want to make that very clear.  I do feel compelled, though, to back up a second. A lot of what is being concluded and has not been evidenced and proved by individuals, pundits and otherwise, John, is, it does center on the -- it would center on the fact that is false, that the RNC and DNC were both hacked.  DICKERSON: How about -- I am just trying to get a sense of the new president-elect\u2019s views about the intelligence community, which doesn\u2019t have to do with that at the moment.  The reason I ask that he has had a lot of intelligence briefings. And then when he was asked about this question, which is coming from the intelligence community, he said that -- it was not a talk -- he said it was a laughing point, in other words, the notion that the Russians were involved in any action was laughable.  And so I am just wondering how he can both respect the intelligence community and then think something they are telling him is laughable. That seems to be a disconnect.  CONWAY: It is completely compatible.  He absolutely respects the intelligence community. He has made very clear he is going to put his own people in there as well. What he has said is laughable and ridiculous is this entire notion, which people are just using as a foregone conclusion, that somehow this was meant to defeat Hillary Clinton and elevate him to the presidency.  It is not -- it is not -- it is untrue and it\u2019s also unfair. It is untrue so far. And it\u2019s unfair because of what he also told a different network, John, which is, look, this was -- this was a significant victory.  He got 306 electoral votes. And the idea that people aren\u2019t trying to undercut that election result is just false.  DICKERSON: Sure. I understand.  CONWAY: They did a recount. They\u2019re vilifying Jim Comey. It\u2019s everybody\u2019s false but Hillary Clinton\u2019s.  DICKERSON: I understand.  So, what I am hearing you say is that he is really questioning this specific claim. But if that is the case then, why then did the transition team put out this statement that said: \u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d referring to the intelligence community?  That\u2019s not a criticism of this specific finding. That is taking their worst moment in the last 15 years and defining the entire intelligence community by that.  Why would he take a swing like that at these people he has now got to work with?  CONWAY: The real question is, why are people taking this specific allegation, which still has confusion among the agencies, no on-the-source record, unnamed official -- quote -- in \u201c\u2019The Washington Post.\u2019\u201d? That is not -- you can\u2019t take that...  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: That is a valid...  CONWAY: ... and make all these conclusions about it.  DICKERSON: It is a totally valid point, but then why respond to it by saying, you know, let\u2019s go back 15 years and talk about the worst part of your record in the intelligence community and remind everybody about that?  It seems disproportionate. Everything you say is right. Why believe rumors? But then why in response to these allegations in the paper take a swing like that at the entire intelligence community?  CONWAY: You know what is disproportionate, John? Entire -- the criticism, the naysayers, the election deniers, that\u2019s what disproportionate. That is not you and that is not your colleagues there.  But that is many people right now. And I will tell you, it is very unfortunate. It is very unfair. This is a democracy that deserves a peaceful transition. The election was five weeks ago, practically, and you have people trying to relitigate it now through this instance, this allegation, frankly.  And, you know, if your, if you\u2019re team Trump, you are accustomed to this. But I want to tell everybody, take the clues from President Obama himself, who has not just congratulated Donald Trump as the new president, but conceded to him.  And he and his advisers have made very clear to all of us, beginning with the president-elect and the vice president-elect, they are there to support this peaceful transition into democracy. And I just believe unfounded allegations like this really undercut that.  DICKERSON: Kellyanne, we appreciate you being with us. Thank you so much.  CONWAY: Thank you, John.  DICKERSON: And now joining us from Burlington, Vermont, is Senator Bernie Sanders.  Senator Sanders, I want to start with you on this question of Russian interference in the election. What do you make of it?  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: Well, I think, when you have the intelligence agencies saying that that happened, when you have John McCain, when you have Democrats, when you have a bipartisan effort saying that we need an investigation, because this is very serious stuff, I think we go forward.  But I don\u2019t want to go backwards. I think we have got to go forward. We have got to take a hard look at the role that the Russians played in this election process. We will see where the investigation goes.  But for Donald Trump to summarily dismiss all of this makes no sense to me at all.  But, John, I will tell you what my major concern is right now, what I am hearing from people all over Vermont and all over this country is, during the campaign, Mr. Trump made some promises. And what people want to know is if he is going to keep the campaign promises that he made.  He said: I, Donald Trump, am not going to cut Social Security. I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare. I\u2019m not going to cut Medicaid.  And yet we are seeing Republicans in the Congress coming forward with devastating plans to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare.  And I challenge Mr. Trump, today, tell the American people you are going to keep your campaign promises. Tell the Republicans to back off, no cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and go forward with your campaign promise to lower the cost of prescription drugs.  DICKERSON: But these promises, or these ideas that are being floated by Republicans, as you point out, are not being -- not coming from Donald Trump himself. So, you still give him the benefit of the doubt on that?  SANDERS: Well, but I think it is important, when you appoint somebody like Congressman Price to be head of Health and Human Services agency, who has spent his career in trying to cut or privatize Medicare, I mean, that is not a good signal to send.  So I think all that Mr. Trump has got to do today is to tell his Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate, back off, it ain\u2019t going to go anywhere, I\u2019m going to veto any legislation that will cut Social Security because I promised the American people that I would not do that.  Look, we have people watching this program right now, we have got disabled veterans watching this program right now who are trying to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year in Social Security. And they are frightened about cuts to Social Security.  My view is, we have got to expand Social Security benefits by lifting the cap on taxable income. If we do that, we can extend Social Security for 50 years. Only the top one-and-a-half percent of people in this country will pay more in taxes. That\u2019s the right thing to do.  But at the very least, president-elect Trump has got to reassure the American people he is going to keep his promises.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator, we are just going to take a quick break.  And we will be right back in a minute with more from Senator Bernie Sanders. Don\u2019t go away.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we are back with Senator Bernie Sanders.  Senator, just going back on this Russian question quickly before we move on, I just want to get a sense from you, do you think the -- a congressional investigation is sufficient? Or is that -- do you have any other thoughts about how these reports should be responded to?  SANDERS: Well, I think, first of all, you need to get the facts. And I think that is what a bipartisan investigation should do.  And once we get the facts, I think we go forward. But the word has got to go out to Russia, any other country on Earth, that we are going to protect our democracy, that cyber-security is very, very dangerous stuff, and we will not tolerate other countries interfering in the democratic process in this country.  DICKERSON: You have some issues -- although we just talked about on Social Security where you disagree with the Republicans, but you have some issues where you could work with Donald Trump. We have talked about this before.  Have they ever reached out to you? They have reached out to some Democrats, the president, Al Gore.  SANDERS: Well, I\u2019m glad, by the way, that they reached out to Al Gore, because, obviously, the former vice president has played an enormously important role in educating the American people about the planetary crisis of climate change.  But I will tell you -- to answer your question, no, they have not reached out to me. I am glad they reached out to Gore. But, apparently, they are not hearing what Gore had to say.  The debate on climate change is over. Climate change is real. It is caused by human activity. It\u2019s already causing devastating problems. It is beyond my comprehension -- it really is -- when the entire planet is struggling to cut carbon emissions, that Mr. Trump would appoint somebody to be head of the EPA who is a denier.  It is too late for that. And the American people are going to have to take matters into their own hands and demand and in their own ways, state by state, transform their energy system away from fossil fuel.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about that, those selections that Donald Trump has made to his -- they go through, those that go through the Senate, you supported the so-called nuclear option, which means those nominations cannot be blocked by a filibuster. Do you regret having supported the nuclear option?  SANDERS: No, I don\u2019t.  But we did that because Republicans were denying -- obstructing President Obama in every way, making it impossible to appoint federal judges, district judges, and really paralyzing the judiciary branch. Many, many people there were not just getting the hearings they needed. We had to move forward.  But, right now, what concerns me very much is, it looks like we have a Cabinet of billionaires. I guess they have a few poor millionaires on it, but, mostly, it is billionaires. And this is coming from a candidate for president, Mr. Trump, who told us he was going to take on the establishment.  Well, maybe I am not seeing something here, but you don\u2019t appoint the head of ExxonMobil to be secretary of state. That is not quite taking on the establishment. You don\u2019t appoint a Cabinet of billionaires to be taking on the establishment. So, we will see how the hearings proceed. But I think there are a lot of very important questions that have to be asked of these nominees.  DICKERSON: But without the filibuster, there is really not much Democrats can do in the Senate.  SANDERS: Well, I think we can expose. If somebody comes forward who tells us that climate change is not real and wants to be head of the EPA, well, we can bring in all of the scientific evidence all over this world to contradict that person and let the American people make a decision.  And if we have somebody who thinks that we should cut Medicare, cut Social Security for disabled veterans, trust me, there will be a lot of very sharp questions of them.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator Sanders, we have to end there. Thanks so much.  And we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Be sure to tune in next week for an interview with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a man with as much insight into the Kremlin as anyone in the American foreign policy establishment.  We will also talk with celebrated author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who has written the cover story for \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d about President Obama as he prepares to leave the White House.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Some of our CBS stations are leaving us now, but, for most of you, we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including our panel, Senator Tim Scott, and a tribute to the astronaut John Glenn.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  Joining us now for our political panel, we have Michael Duffy, deputy managing editor of \u201cTime\u201d magazine. This year\u2019s \u201cTime\u201d magazine person of the year is Donald Trump. Jamelle Bouie is a CBS News political analyst and chief political correspondent at Slate. Lisa Lerer is national politics reporter for The Associated Press. And Michael Gerson is a columnist for \u201cThe Washington Post.\u201d  Michael Duffy, let\u2019s start with Russia and the election. What do you make of it? And what do you make of Donald Trump\u2019s response to the intelligence community? Let\u2019s start there.  MICHAEL DUFFY, \u201cTIME\u201d MAGAZINE: Well, I think there are two shocks, and it\u2019s important not to overreact or underreact to either of them. The facts on the ground, that the intelligence community has concluded that Russia tried to turn the election to Donald Trump is deeply disturbing. It means that Russia attacked the United States. And -- and an investigation, a bipartisan investigation, under some banners, John McCain said, is inevitable now.  But the second shock is Donald Trump\u2019s reaction. He seems to be implying or suggesting, both in his tweets and his comments, that he does -- he\u2019s not really interested in what happened during the election. He doesn\u2019t think whatever happened should affect U.S./Russia relations going forward. And he\u2019s drawn a fairly dark cloud over his relationship with the intelligence community, on whom he will rely and need as president and need to be successful as president. So I think sweeping this stuff under the rug as a first reaction might be at his own peril.  DICKERSON: Jamelle, as Michael points out, that the distinction here on the CIA and what they seem to have found, what\u2019s new here. We heard about Russian involvement potentially while the election was going on, but what seems to be new is that it was targeted to help Donald Trump. That seems to be the new development that -- that we\u2019re -- that in order to just update people on where things are.  JAMELLE BOUIE, \u201cSLATE\u201d MAGAZINE: Right. Right. Exactly. We -- we\u2019ve sort of had to acknowledge and suspicion that the Russian government has been involved in, you know, helping leak documents like -- and -- and engaging in election interference that way, but that\u2019s different. That\u2019s materially different than the suggestion that, hey, they were doing this specifically to help Donald Trump.  I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sort of in this place right now where I\u2019m not entirely sure, beyond investigations, beyond sort of serious scrutiny of this, what -- what we do about this, because it really is unprecedented. And if -- if it is true, if -- if we have further verification of this, then what it suggests potentially is that the election was in some sense ill legit. And I don\u2019t know where you go from there.  DICKERSON: All right, Lisa, is anybody calling -- because where you would go -- if -- if you take that as a conclusion, then that takes you somewhere more than an investigation. That kind of stopped the -- stop the presses --  LISA LERER, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Right.  DICKERSON: Or stops the process. Is anybody calling for that right yet?  LERER: Nobody\u2019s calling for that. That, of course, is Donald Trump\u2019s number one fear --  BOUIE: Right.  LERER: Is that this will destroy this sweeping mandate that he believes he has. He, of course, does not have that since it was a very -- unlike what he\u2019s claimed again and again, it was a very tight race and Hillary Clinton had -- you know, won the popular vote by a large margin.  But, you know, that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t look into this. Look, fair and free elections are the fundamental underpinning of American democracy. We live in this conspiracy era age, as we saw from like the proliferation of fake news over the election. You\u2019re playing a dangerous game if you start having voters and the electorate lose confidence --  BOUIE: Right.  LERER: In the integrity of our election.  So it is really important to investigate this, whether it changes the outcome or not. And Hillary Clinton\u2019s team did a really extensive investigation of whether there was any systemic manipulation of results from Russians or otherwise and they found that the answer was no. So her team is even saying that this could have potentially -- you know, the election was rigged or something like that. But, you know, the investigation has to happen regardless.  DICKERSON: Michael Gerson, as -- as Michael Duffy was saying, you know, presidents that get in fights with their CIA or with their intelligence communities --  MICHAEL GERSON, \u201cTHE WASHINGTON POST\u201d: They lose. I can\u2019t think of an instance where a White House and the CIA got into conflict where the CIA did not win through leaks and other things. I mean that is the history of this.  But even more importantly, you know, we face such a variety of threats right now, if it\u2019s China in the, you know, South China See, or if it\u2019s North Korean nukes or it\u2019s threats for Russia to the Baltic states. We need a good relationship between the intelligence community and the president. And people I talk to in the intelligence community about this were most offended by the ad hominem nature of this attack. They felt like -- one told me, i feel like he\u2019s, you know, attacking little Marco or lying Ted, OK? That\u2019s the way he\u2019s treating his intelligence community.  DICKERSON: That\u2019s --  LERER: And, you know, I think this is also a really interesting moment for domestic politics. He\u2019s -- Donald Trump is really putting his own party in an impossible position. Either they go against their incoming president, who\u2019s shown a propensity, as you point out, to -- for these ad hominem attacks, or they go against voters, a majority of which don\u2019t trust Russia and, you know, a significant portion of which would like to see a tougher line against Russia. So he -- you know, I think part of what John McCain is doing is giving the rest of the party cover by calling for these investigations, but it\u2019s not an easy way to start that relationship.  DUFFY: Well, I was just going to say one other thing about -- about where we\u2019re going here in terms of an investigation, in terms of future events, regardless of what\u2019s happened already. We know from the campaign, John, that Democratic e-mails were vacuumed up and leaked. We don\u2019t know exactly how much was vacuumed up from the Republican e- mails, but we now know from the intelligence -- or the reports about the intelligence committee\u2019s assessment that they also got Republican e-mails, which means someone in -- if that\u2019s true, and, of course, the RNC has denied this, but if it\u2019s true, and it stands to reason that it may be true, then someone in Moscow or in Russia is holding on to all of those e-mails too. And those affect not Hillary Clinton, but Donald Trump, presumably, as he steps into the role of president.  DICKERSON: Right.  DUFFY: So whatever force in -- with Russia that is in control of this information, or this -- now stands in a position to exert some leverage if it is true --  DICKERSON: Right.  DUFFY: Over the future president.  BOUIE: And it\u2019s --  LERER: (INAUDIBLE).  BOUIE: It\u2019s worth saying as well that we -- we have very little information on Donald Trump\u2019s financial ties on -- on sort of the -- the -- the business -- his business dealings globally. So it\u2019s entirely possible that in addition to that information, there are reams of information about Trump\u2019s relationship with financial interests in Russia that we\u2019re sort of completely blind to and opaque to.  LERER: It\u2019s not clear that he -- that Putin loves Donald Trump. We know that he did not like Hillary Clinton, right? And that\u2019s an important distinction, you know?  BOUIE: Right.  LERER: He certainly could turn on Trump or the Republicans just as quickly if it was in his interests.  DICKERSON: And just to help those who may not have been following along, \u201cThe New York Times\u201d has reported that these e-mails may have been hacked at the Republican Committee. The Trump campaign and the RNC are pushing very much against that.  GERSON: Against (ph) that, right.  DICKERSON: Kellyanne Conway was trying to bring that up. I was focused more on, you know, points a and b, but they -- they dispute that \u201cNew York Times\u201d claim.  DUFFY: I would dispute it too, but I --  DICKERSON: You mean if you were in their position?  DUFFY: I would, but I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s potentially quite a big lever if -- if the evidence takes us in that direction. I think it\u2019s something we all are looking for as a next step in this investigation.  DICKERSON: Right.  So, Michael Gerson, let\u2019s switch a little bit to the Trump -- the picks, the cabinet picks he\u2019s made.  GERSON: Oh, sure.  DICKERSON: Let\u2019s start with the secretary of state. Rex Tillerson, the CEO of Exxon, is in the mix, maybe, although now Donald Trump has tweeted today, and he -- and he said the following. \u201cWhether I choose him,\u201d this is Tillerson, \u201cor not for state, Rex Tillerson, the chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil, is a world class player and deal maker, period. Stay tuned!\u201d  The secretary of state pick has been a bouncing ball. It\u2019s kind of been interesting to follow. What do you make of how this is going?  GERSON: Well, I kind of feel bad for Tillerson in a certain way because he comes into this context. He\u2019s a very competent guy, respected business leader, but in the midst of all of this, his views on Russia are going to get hyper scrutiny, and, you know, Russia wants one thing, more than anything else, which is to get rid of the sanctions without changing their behavior, OK? And, you know, Tillerson has opposed sanctions in the past, has a history of opposes sanctions, and so he\u2019s going to be put in this context. He\u2019s -- he seemed like a qualified nominee who some people are going to say is a payoff for services rendered.  DICKERSON: Lisa, do you think there\u2019s a -- a trial balloon aspect to this? Donald Trump now saying whether I pick -- choose him or not. I mean this has been sort of the fourth or fifth name for secretary of state.  LERER: Yes.  DICKERSON: Is this trial by sort of response and then he\u2019ll make another choice?  LERER: Well, the process has been remarkable to watch. And what\u2019s been most -- one of the most striking things to me has been the -- just the vast policy differences between the people whose names are being considered. So you have Tillerson, who, of course, opposed sanctions and won the friendship medal from Russia, and then you have Mitt Romney, who in 2012 people now say didn\u2019t get enough credit for calling Russia the biggest geopolitical threat. This feels more like who\u2019s going to get the rose, you know?  DICKERSON: Right.  LERER: It\u2019s a personality contest. He wants -- clearly that\u2019s what Donald Trump -- he likes executives. He like people who are a big presence. He said himself, he wants someone who looks the part. So that\u2019s been really interesting and I think it gives us some insight into how Donald Trump is going to make decisions and what we can expect.  DICKERSON: Jamelle, what do you make of the other choices that Donald Trump has made, or not made? There have been all kinds of people going by the cameras at Trump Tower. Some of them get jobs and then some of them, like Al Gore, are there, we\u2019re not sure, for what reason, but -- but -- well, and the reason I say that is -- is that Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the EPA, Scott Pruitt, is -- is an -- is an opponent of the EPA.  BOUIE: Right. Right.  DICKERSON: Donald Trump said he wants to basically dismantle the EPA. Do we have a situation here in which department heads are being asked to go in and basically take apart their departments?  BOUIE: I think we may. This is not just true of Trump\u2019s pick for the EPA, but for the Labor Department and for to the Department of Education, you have picks that seem to be opposed to the missions of those agencies. I cannot recall the name of Trump\u2019s pick for the Labor Department at this moment, but he is a long-time opponent of raising minimum wages, he\u2019s a long-time opponent of unitization, he\u2019s and long-time opponent basically of anything workers can do to organize themselves and -- and sort of advocate for themselves. And that\u2019s a -- a very odd choice to have for a department that has jurisdiction over (INAUDIBLE) national labor relations department.  DICKERSON: Andrew Puzder is the nominee.  DUFFY: It\u2019s -- there\u2019s no question this is setting up to be the -- the closest cabinet or a government, an executive branch with the closest relationship between government and business, at least since Ronald Reagan and maybe since Eisenhower. But I was just going to say that I -- in a -- in a race that was supposedly about outsiders versus insiders, about non-elites versus elites, this is shaping up to be a pretty -- a group of consummate insiders. You know, two governors, half a dozen CEOs, several people from Goldman Sachs, you know, representatives. And -- and Trump gave that amazing quote yesterday where he said, or maybe it was Friday where he said, I want people that made a fortune.  DICKERSON: Yes.  DUFFY: Because he believes that people with money negotiate from strength, which is interesting in a -- in a public service or a government job because you\u2019d think that the strength that they negotiate from is the will of the people, the consent of the governed, but he wants that added piece, which is, he doesn\u2019t just want that, he wants something else.  GERSON: I think there\u2019s a fallacy there too about business leaders and military leaders, that their habits of command, their approach to governing can transfer to governing. I mean sometimes, you know, we don\u2019t know if the person who built up the World Wrestling Federation can run the SBA, the Small Business Administration --  DUFFY: But we\u2019re going to find out.  GERSON: Yes. You have to lead. Career bureaucrats get the best work out of them. You have to come up with policy ideas, trying to get in the State of Union. There\u2019s a bunch of skills that, you know, it\u2019s not an exact overlap.  LERER: You know, for a guy who promised to drain the swamp, it\u2019s awfully, awfully murky in Washington these days. And, you know, it\u2019s not just the business leaders. It\u2019s, of course, the donors.  BOUIE: Right.  LERER: Linda McMahon, the incoming head of the SBA, gave $7 million to Trump\u2019s super PAC. That\u2019s a third of all the money that that super PAC collected. So you do wonder, is there a certain point at which his supporters -- you know he ran on this very populist message -- say, you know, this isn\u2019t what we bargained for.  DICKERSON: And he specifically said he wouldn\u2019t have big donors or lobbyist in his administration.  LERER: Right.  DICKERSON: So he\u2019s gone back on that.  BOUIE: So I think this gets to the nature of Trump\u2019s populism. You know, for as much as I think right now it\u2019s characterized as being against elites, it\u2019s elites as agents of immigration. It\u2019s elites as agents of tolerating black protesters, right? It\u2019s elites as they regard -- as they relate to nonwhites in America. And I have the suspicion that as long as Trump continues to cast elitism as being somehow racial, that elitism is a function of tolerating all these foreign elements in the United States, that Trump\u2019s voters aren\u2019t going to particularly care about who he appoints to cabinet agencies.  GERSON: Yes, I -- I would say that one thing that units all Republicans, McConnell, Ryan, Trump, is undoing the Obama legacy. I think that\u2019s about a lot -- a lot of these appointments are about that. He wants to undo the regulatory approach, undo executive orders. In fact, there\u2019s been a process to review under the Federalist Society, a bunch of -- of executive orders, so they\u2019re ready on day one to -- to revoke them. So I do think that\u2019s a -- kind of a unifying goal. We don\u2019t know what he wants to do in a bunch of different areas, but that\u2019s pretty common between Republicans.  DICKERSON: All right, we\u2019re going to have to end it there. Thanks to all of you.  Gosh, so much to get to. All right, thanks to all of you and we\u2019ll be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Last week, a mistrial was declared in the shooting death of a black man, Walter Scott, by a white police officer in South Carolina. And it also marked the beginning of the trial of Dylann Roof, who admits killing nine in a shooting rampage at the Mother Emmanuel Church in Charleston. Both incidents have put a painful focus on race relations in the state, which we talked about with South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: Donald Trump ran for president saying, I\u2019m going to be the law and order president. How does that come across in the community?  SEN. TIM SCOTT (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: A lot of people define it differently, law and order. I see law and order as a good, constructive part of what makes a community safer. So my approach and my perspective is that a law and order type of environment will be conducive for a higher quality of life. You\u2019ll see more folks hopefully out in the streets enjoying their neighbors than they -- than you have in the past and you\u2019ll have more law enforcement officers understanding and appreciating the communities by spending time, getting to know those communities when there is no incident to come and investigate. So I\u2019m -- I\u2019m fairly optimistic about that concept of law and order.  DICKERSON: What some people heard when -- when he talked about law and order was a kind of force first. A kind of escalation of fear about the community, about the inner cities. And some people believe that creates a state of fear that works against all the work you\u2019ve been doing to try to create empathy.  SCOTT: I would hope not and certainly people hear different things when they their law and order. My hope is that what we\u2019ll do overtime is we\u2019ll see that progress has not been stymied under a Trump administration, but we\u2019ll see that it has prospered. We\u2019re going to have to be very careful on what we do and what we say, and the circumstances, so as to bring people together and not see -- sew seeds that are poisonous.  DICKERSON: Donald Trump knows how to put on a good show. We saw him do it with Carrier. And not only protected jobs, but sent a message to working people all across the country. What could he do on these sets of issues having to do with community relationships with police that would be -- have that kind of -- same kind of message sending capability?  SCOTT: Well, one of the fastest things he can do that would bring about great change is to embrace our opportunity agenda that we\u2019ve been working on for the last three or four years. It starts with understanding that every zip code in this country needs quality education. If there\u2019s not a quality school in your neighborhood, we should make sure that there is one, whether that\u2019s charter schools or virtual schools or magnet schools or private schools. Realize that every student does not want to go to college, so having a duel track in education, you\u2019re too young to remember shop in high school.  DICKERSON: Oh, no, I took shop.  SCOTT: And now we know that you can -- you can be on FACE THE NATION if you take shop. This is great. So the --  DICKERSON: It\u2019s the only way you can get there.  SCOTT: So having that shop, that duel track, is a really important part of (INAUDIBLE) programs, something that I believe that Donald Trump will -- will focus on as president.  DICKERSON: Is there something you can think of that would be symbolic, that would send that kind of strong signal that he sent with the Carrier operation?  SCOTT: Well, I think, obviously, spending time is perhaps the thing that you do that is -- doesn\u2019t require legislation. It\u2019s how you use your time. And we are intentional about using my time in a way that says to communities that have perhaps felt disenfranchised from the conservative moment, we care. We go there. We spend time. We listen. We don\u2019t come with solutions first.  If Donald Trump will take the time and spend some time in Cleveland and Detroit and in Charleston and in other places, I think he\u2019ll find that people are receptive to the person who invests their time, energy and then their talents into solving problems.  DICKERSON: You gave a speech back in July after the -- the shootings in Baton Rouge and in Dallas, and you talked about, while there are so many officers that do good, you had experienced and seen those that did not.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SCOTT: In the course of one year, I have been stopped seven times by law enforcement officers. Not four, not five, not six, but seven times in one year as an elected official. I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you are being targeted for not being more than being just yourself.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: What\u2019s been the reaction to that speech since then?  SCOTT: I think it\u2019s opened the eyes to a lot of folks who perhaps have listened to the cries and the screams and the shouts of others and disregarded those. I think perhaps my speaking out on the issue has validated the concerns of many African-American males who have gone through similar situations, but it has says to others on the other side that perhaps there\u2019s some validity to the issue and we should take a second look.  DICKERSON: The conversation of race, and particularly where policing gets involved, gets hot pretty fast.  SCOTT: Absolutely.  DICKERSON: How bad has the pushback been?  SCOTT: Oh, yes, they\u2019ve -- some folks believe that, you know, it\u2019s been fairly aggressive without any question. But, listen, the way I look at it is, you either do the right thing for the right reasons or you don\u2019t. Speaking out on something that is real is the right thing. Folks who believe that I\u2019m -- I\u2019m feeding into a narrative, that\u2019s their problem, not mine. So I\u2019m -- I\u2019m comfortable with where I am. It\u2019s not necessarily been a comfortable ride, a journey, but it\u2019s been a necessary journey. But the good news is that disproportionately speaking, the response has been tremendously positive.  DICKERSON: The story you\u2019re trying to tell is -- it goes back, it seems to me, to this idea of empathy, understanding that there are two views here.  SCOTT: Well, that\u2019s something I try to explain to both sides, seek first to understand, and then to be understood. Said differently, even those folks who, to be blunt, the black community leaders need to spend time doing ride alongs with officers. You need to understand and appreciate the milliseconds that you may have in making decisions. You need to walk in those shoes for a little while. And by the same token, I -- I encourage and sometimes aggressively encourage, spend some time in neighborhoods. I grew up in many of those neighborhoods. I was a poor kid in a single parent household living in a very small house. I understand the pain and the suffering, the challenges and the frustration. You\u2019ve got to know the people that you -- you are responsible or placed in charge of.  DICKERSON: There are a lot of people who feel not only that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t represent them, but people of color who believe that he actively played on fears in the African-American community, in -- in -- basically in urban areas played on fears to get elected. How do you bridge that gap?  SCOTT: Anyone who watched this election and did not see that fear was a part of both sides of the aisle missed the election. I think we would have the same conversation had Hillary won, by the way, just perhaps a different perspective but the same conversation of fear and frustration. So what I say to folks is, let\u2019s give Mr. Trump a chance. Let\u2019s gauge progress in his administration by what he does. And I\u2019m going to hold him accountable, like every single American should hold all of our presidents accountable.  DICKERSON: Charleston\u2019s had a tough couple of years.  SCOTT: Absolutely.  DICKERSON: Walter Scott and the Mother Emmanuel Church. What -- tell, where are things now?  SCOTT: They certainly are sensitive times. There are -- there are levels of frustration, without any question. There\u2019s a lot of hope, though. There are African-American and white pastors coming together, asking our community to show the same type of resolve that we did after the Walter Scott shooting, after the Mother Emmanuel shooting. We are one cohesive Charleston family and we say we\u2019re Charleston strong. So the goal is to remain confident in the judicial process. I am confident that the -- that justice will be done.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator Scott, thanks so much.  SCOTT: Yes, sir. Look forward to talking with you again.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: The astronaut John Glenn died this week. In 1962, Glenn was the first American to orbit the earth.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God speed, John Glenn.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Roger, the clock is operating. We\u2019re underway.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: As he rose into the blue on that February day, Glenn described his every sensation.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JOHN GLENN, ASTRONAUT: Oh, that view is tremendous.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: When it was announced he\u2019d be the jockey on the Atlas D Rocket, news cameras gave him and his wife Annie a taste of a new phenomenon, the celebrity front lawn treatment. My mom was one of the ones trampling the grass.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  NANCY HANSCHMAN: This is Nancy Hanschman in Arlington, Virginia, at the home of Colonel John Glenn. He\u2019s back here resting with his wife Annie and their two children on this very bitter cold morning in Virginia. The astronaut came out to answer questions from reporters.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Glenn\u2019s active courage was a wonder to gaze at, but it was also a boost for Americans worried the Soviet Union and communism were winning. Glenn was proof that free societies could achieve greatness.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The cheering crowds roar a mighty welcome.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Glenn embodied every virtue Americans liked to think they had as a birthright, honor, modesty, grit, and courage. He was all-American. Now when the television cameras come to the front lawn to record the latest outrage, John Glenn\u2019s death reminds us again what makes America great, character and that there was a time when the quite display of it was a thing that we gathered around the television to watch.  Senator Glenn was 95. Godspeed, John Glenn.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: For us today. Thanks for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I\u2019m John Dickerson. \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Stocks saw solid gains Wednesday, defying expectations of a slump in financial markets following Donald Trump \u2018s stunning victory in the the U.S. presidential race. Global markets, which had been jittery over the prospect of a Trump administration in recent weeks, plunged overnight after it became apparent that he was leading at the polls.\u00a0 The Dow Jones industrial index flirted with record territory, shooting up 257 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 18,589. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index rose 24 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,163. The Nasdaq composite added 58 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,258. U.S. bond yields have surged in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory, a sign that investors think the outlook for the U.S. economy remains positive. The yield, or interest rate, on the U.S.\u2019s ten-year bonds is up 0.08 percentage point at 1.948 percent. That has helped the dollar recover its poise following earlier losses when Trump\u2019s victory became increasingly likely. The euro, for example, is now basically flat on the day at $1.1025. European stocks also closed higher after markets recovered from early losses. Germany\u2019s DAX ended the day 1.6 percent higher at 10,646.01 while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 1 percent to 6,911.84. France\u2019s CAC 40 rose 1.5 percent to 4,543.48. All the indexes were lower earlier in the day. One reason investors may be signaling their approval is that Trump\u2019s election could short-circuit possible plans by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as early as December, as many Wall Street analysts had expected.\u00a0 Trump also sounded a conciliatory tone in his victory speech, encouraging hope that he could moderate some of his more extreme positions once in the White House.\u00a0 \u201c[W]e doubt that Trump will follow through fully on his threats to impose large trade tariffs on Mexico or China, or to withdraw from existing deals (even though he does have a lot of leeway to do so without congressional approval),\u201d economists with Capital Economics said in a client note. Still, the outcome of the election proved a massive surprise for economic and market analysts, who overwhelmingly predicted a victory for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 The result also delivered a historic electoral mandate for Republicans, who will have control of Congress beginning in January. The last time Republicans controlled the White House, Senate and House was in 1928, when California Republican Herbert Hoover beat New York Democrat Al Smith. Investors scrambled Monday to digest the impact of the election on issues including global trade, taxes, monetary policy, health care, financial regulation and immigration. The gains Wednesday were led by drugmakers, which would have faced the likelihood of price controls under Clinton. Pfizer (PFE) jumped soared 8 percent, the biggest gain on the Dow. Hospital operators sank. Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act. HCA Holdings (HCA) plunged 14 percent. \u201cTrump\u2019s victory in the presidential election is likely to bring a set of policies that diverge sharply from those of the prior administration,\u201d said Robard Williams, senior vice president of Credit Strategy and Standards at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, in a note.",

Michigan has not yet been called, and it\u2019s the closest of the three states. If the three states were to move into Clinton\u2019s column, she would win, with 278 electoral votes, but this seems very unlikely. It\u2019s rare that recounts change the result of a race.

Earlier today, Trump had said he was \u201cseriously considering\u201d Carson for the job. I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people! In a meeting with the New York Times, Donald Trump appeared to back away from some of the most prominent promises he made during his presidential campaign, notably, whether he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton, and whether or not torture should be used in the war on terror.

The meeting between the president-elect and the 2012 GOP nominee was initially scheduled as a courtesy visit, and could have been awkward, given the animosity between the two during the presidential campaign. In March,\u00a0Romney delivered a speech specifically intended to derail Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy, calling him a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cphony.\u201d Trump, in turn,\u00a0labeled Romney a \u201closer\u201d and a \u201cchoke artist.\u201d Yet whatever tension there may have been seems to have dissipated. \u201cTrump enjoyed the meeting,\u201d the source told CBS News. Though Rudy Giuliani has been a leading candidate for secretary of state -- the source said Trump has had his \u201chead wrapped around Rudy Giuliani\u201d for the position \u2013 Trump has reconsidered since his meeting with Romney. Also, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, despite a meeting with Mr. Trump this past weekend, is out of the running for a position as a top adviser or department chief. Christie has been telling supporters he\u2019s \u201cin it for the long run.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019ll serve out his term as governor which ends in January 2018, and await what may come from Bridgegate. Christie, according to the source, wanted to be attorney general. His view is that he\u2019s been a good soldier for Mr. Trump throughout the campaign, once he ended his own presidential bid, and he\u2019ll continue to sit back and be a good soldier in hopes of serving in Trump\u2019s administration years from now. Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose father Christie prosecuted, was a driving force behind Christie\u2019s ouster from Trump world. -- Arden Farhi 10:08 a.m. ET Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with the New York Times is back on just hours after he ranted against the news organization on Twitter.

The topic didn\u2019t come up in the brief statement Pelosi and Pence made to the press afterward, in which they both expressed their desire to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d going forward. Both of them made mention of the fact that Pence, who served in Congress for 10 years, is familiar with Capitol Hill. 3:00 p.m. ET Mike Pence meets with individual members of Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. 11:00 a.m. ET Vice president-elect Mike Pence met with the Congressional Republican conference Thursday in Washington, D.C., telling the GOP that he was \u201cexcited\u201d about the Trump agenda.\u00a0 Pence, a former Indiana congressman, called it \u201chumbling\u201d to be back among his former colleagues.\u00a0 \u201cI am just very confident as we move toward inauguration and bring together a great team and work in concert with leaders in the House and Senate that we are going to move an agenda that rebuilds our military, revives our economy and in a word: make America great again,\u201d Pence said. UNIFIED. pic.twitter.com/QqXrIClMtX He is expected to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell later in the afternoon.\u00a0 10:50 a.m. ET In the president-elect\u2019s daily transition conference call with Sean Spicer and Jason Miller, the transition team offered a list of people Mr. Trump is meeting with today, including: South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Oracle business executive Safra Catz, Admiral Mike Rogers, and the Family Research Council\u2019s Ken Blackwell.\u00a0 Miller and Spicer also teased Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Abe, but made sure to indicate that there\u2019s only one president of the United States and the meeting with Abe was private.\u00a0 7:45 a.m. ET Kellyanne Conway on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d weighed in on\u00a0news of the Trump transition team, including Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was reportedly seeking national security clearance earlier this week.\u00a0 \u201cHe obviously is incredibly important to his father-in-law President-Elect Trump and was [a] big part of our election victory, frankly,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that he and his wife and her brothers will continue to be very supportive. But time will tell in terms of the positions that different people fill.\u201d On other names floated for Cabinet positions, Conway discussed the possibility of the secretary of state post getting filled by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. \u201cIt would probably be irresponsible to go ahead and name all the people right at once,\u201d Conway said. \u201cBut we\u2019re very happy that Governor Haley is coming to meet with President-elect Trump. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have a broad-- a wide ranging conversation.\u201d\u00a0 And of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is another contender to head up the State Department, Conway has this to say: \u201cIf he were the secretary of state, he would command a certain presence worldwide. But I think he\u2019s -- he\u2019s qualified for many different positions.\u201d Trump has begun making offers on key posts; lobbying ban instituted; Pence and Biden meet 11:52 p.m.: The president-elect began making offers for some key posts in his administration Wednesday, two sources close to the administration told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is being considered for Secretary of State, and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. -- Major Garrett The Trump transition team announced Wednesday evening that people who join the administration will have to adhere to a\u00a0lobbying ban: there will be no one hired who is a current registered lobbyist, and no lobbying will be allowed for five years after leaving government. It\u2019s an attempt, according to transition and RNC spokesman Sean Spicer, to ensure that those leaving government will not be able to immediately enrich themselves off their service. -- Sopan Deb 5:57 p.m. ET A Department of Justice official said Wednesday that the department hasn\u2019t been contacted yet by the Trump transition team and it\u2019s prepared when they reach out. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been contacted or received names of the transition team yet, but we\u2019re prepared to help when they do reach out. \u00a0The Department began planning for this transition well before the election and we are fully prepared to assist the incoming transition team. We are committed to a smooth and successful transition, including the seamless continuation of the department\u2019s essential law enforcement and national security functions which are performed each and every day by its career staff,\u201d the official said. 3:30 p.m. ET Vice President Joe Biden weighed in on the shakeup of the presidential transition team during a photo opportunity with vice president-elect Mike Pence and reporters Wednesday. \u00a0 \u201cNo administration is ready on day one,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready on day one. I\u2019ve never met one that\u2019s ever been ready on day one. But I\u2019m confident on day one everything will be in good hands and they\u2019ll be able to handle everything.\u201d 3:24 p.m. ET The presidential transition team announced Wednesday that President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have spoken with a number of foreign heads of state since winning the general election, including Russian leader Vladimir Putin. 3:16 p.m. ET\u00a0Transition chairman and vice president-elect Mike Pence has signed and submitted the Memorandum of Understanding formally initiating the transition with the Obama administration, according to White House spokesperson Brandi Hoffine. (New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who initially headed the transition operation, had signed it initially, but a new MOU was required when Christie was booted from his post.) The White House is still waiting to receive a list of relevant names from Mr. Trump\u2019s transition office so that individuals can begin interfacing with relevant agencies between now and January 20. Once that paperwork is submitted, transition employees can begin receiving documents and briefings from current members of the administration. The Obama administration says it has been preparing for the handover for months. At the state department briefing, John Kirby said there has been no contact between the transition team and State.\u00a0 1:26 p.m. ET\u00a0Mr. Trump met Wednesday with Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society to discuss Supreme Court nominations. Leo held a brief gaggle in the Trump Tower lobby with reporters after the meeting\u00a0 Leo called the meeting a \u201cproductive session\u201d and said Mr. Trump is committed to nominating a justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia who is \u201cindependent, courageous, smart [and] very high quality.\u201d Mr. Trump told Leo (and Kellyanne Conway reaffirmed) that he would pick from a list of 21 names that has already been released.\u00a0 The president-elect did not specify a timetable for a nomination, but said it was a \u201chigh priority,\u201d according to Leo. Mr. Trump also met with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio at Trump Tower Wednesday. According to Kellyanne Conway, who spoke with reporters briefly about the meeting, the hour-long meeting was \u201cvery productive.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI was glad that the mayor came here -- obviously mayor of the nation\u2019s largest city and a neighbor to the new president elect,\u201d Conway said. \u201cSo it was good that that happened.\u201d 12:02 a.m. ET Adviser and former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway discussed the transition team with reporters Wednesday during her visit to Trump Tower in New York. Of the reports that the transition team was in disarray, Conway said that they were \u201cfalse.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe just don\u2019t see it that way -- it\u2019s not that way,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Asked when the president-elect would have a press conference, Conway said one was expected \u201cshortly -- some time soon.\u201d 11:30 a.m. ET Jason Miller, a spokesperson for Mr. Trump, spoke with reporters Wednesday about the transition team and the president-elect\u2019s recent appointment of Steve Bannon as a top White House strategist.\u00a0 \u201cSteve Bannon is someone who\u2019s done a wonderful job on the campaign trail,\u201d Miller said, noting that he\u2019s seen \u201ca high character from\u201d the former campaign CEO and that Bannon has \u201creally embraced diversity at every step.\u201d\u00a0 Miller weighed in on the recent shakeup in the transition team, saying vice president-elect Pence was \u201ccoming in and making good on president-elect Trump\u2019s promise that we\u2019re not going to have any lobbyists involved with the transition efforts.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s happening in a very orderly fashion,\u201d Miller said of the transition to the White House. \u201cWe feel very good about it.\u201d\u00a0 10:57 a.m. ET Vice president-elect Mike Pence arrives at the Trump team\u2019s Washington, D.C. transition office.\u00a0 Pence, who now heads the transition to the White House, purged the team Tuesday of the many registered lobbyists, leaving them short-staffed but closer to Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d 10:20 a.m. ET A senior transition team member tells CBS News that the transition is back on track after purging many of the people put in place by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. They had to effectively re-build the team \u201cfrom scratch\u201d due to a number of poor appointments by Christie but they feel good about the team now. They hope to have some announcements today but do not expect any senior positions to be named. 9:00 a.m. ET Mr. Trump continues to tweet his denial that his transition team is facing any difficulty.\u00a0 The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. Eric Trump arrived at Trump Tower early Wednesday morning and spoke briefly with reporters.\u00a0 Asked if the transition team would be naming more positions later in the day, the younger Trump said it was \u201clikely.\u201d Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, is expected to speak to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C. Wednesday. He will also have lunch with Vice President Joe Biden in the afternoon. Trump transition: \u201cstalled...scrambling...on pause;\u201d Rogers out on transition team; Giuliani is top contender for secretary of state; McCain issues Russia warning Trump tweet denies any turmoil in transition. Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! Trump received his first Presidential Daily Briefing today. It is similar (if not the exactly the same) as the briefing given to President Obama. Mr.  Obama authorized President-elect Trump to receive the same briefing he receives. The briefing allows for questioning of the briefer, so in that respect the briefing between Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump may differ. Vice President-elect Pence is scheduled to receive his first PDB Wednesday. -- by Andres Triay 5:44 p.m. As the transition stalls, Sen. Armed Services Chairman John McCain issued a warning to the Trump administration about hitting the \u201creset\u201d button on relations with Russia, as Hillary Clinton attempted to do early in the Obama adminstration.\u00a0 \u201cThe Obama Administration\u2019s last attempt at resetting relations with Russia culminated in Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and military intervention in the Middle East. At the very least, the price of another \u2018reset\u2019 would be complicity in Putin and Assad\u2019s butchery of the Syrian people. That is an unacceptable price for a great nation,\u201d McCain\u2019s statement read. Of Putin\u2019s assertion that he wants to improve U.S.-Russia relations, McCain said, \u201cWe should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America\u2019s allies, and attempted to undermine America\u2019s elections.\u201d 4:19 p.m.\u00a0 The state of the transition is \u201cstalled...scrambling...and on pause,\u201d according to several sources familiar with the transition. The team at this point is not \u201cup and running fully\u201d after \u201cblowing up\u201d the team, beginning with Chris Christie\u2019s recent ouster as the chairman of the transition team.\u00a0 Personnel announcements that were supposed to be made this week have been put on hold.\u00a0 Members of the transition staff are waiting for further instructions from Trump Tower.\u00a0 For all intents and purposes, Christie no longer has a role in the transition, although formally he was merely demoted to the level of vice chair, a title held by several members of the team. He\u2019s \u201cgone, not involved -- on the sideline,\u201d according to one source, as is\u00a0ally Mike Rogers. \u00a0 Top contenders for cabinet positions include Rudy Giuliani for secretary of state, Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Kelly Ayotte for secretary of defense, Steven Mnuchin for Treasury and Ray Washburne for Commerce. \u00a0-- by Arden Farhi, Major Garrett and Steve Chaggaris 2 p.m.\u00a0 Former Rep. Mike Rogers announced he\u2019s stepping down as national security adviser for the Trump transition team. A GOP member of the national security establishment told CBS News\u2019 David Martin that Rogers was forced off because of his closeness to Chris Christie, who had been in charge of the transition before he was demoted last week (Christie is now one of several transition vice chairs). The other strike against Rogers was that he had done his own investigation of Benghazi and found that Hillary Clinton had done nothing wrong. Rogers\u2019 departure from the transition team may raise concerns among Republicans -- he\u2019s respected by the intelligence community and by his former colleagues in Congress, and he was a reassuring presence, since Trump has no foreign policy credentials. Rogers had been serving as a national security adviser to the transition team and he said his work has laid the groundwork for the post-election phase of Trump\u2019s effort.\u00a0-- by Rebecca Shabad The Trump team is seeking top-secret security clearances for Trump\u2019s children, Julianna Goldman reports.\u00a0 The Trump team has asked the White House to explore the possibility of getting his children the top secret security clearances. Logistically, the children would need to be designated by the current White House as national security advisers to their father to receive top secret clearances.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump took his last bow Saturday in Mobile, Alabama, concluding his victory tour with a final look back at his campaign trail triumphs, an election night tick-tock and a promise to focus on an economic agenda that \u201ccan be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\u201d \u201cThere is no better place to celebrate than right here,\u201d the president-elect told a crowd in Mobile, saying that the Alabama city was \u201cwhere it all began.\u201d  Amid intermittent cheers of \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d the president-elect crowed his approval of the state, saying voters \u201cpropelled\u201d the campaign to \u201ca historic win for the American worker and the American people.\u201d The president-elect relived what he counted among his campaign\u2019s greatest hits, including his defeat of third-party candidate Evan McMullin in Utah, his scant spending on political advertising and the frenetic pace of his rallies in the home stretch of the election.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s worked harder in the last months of a presidential campaign,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referencing himself.  But the spotlight wasn\u2019t all on the president-elect.  Mr. Trump also brought out a parade of surrogates during his own speech, calling to the stage Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now a top adviser to his transition team. (She told rally-goers that the president-elect had won \u201cover 2,600 counties\u201d and 306 electoral votes.) He also had spokeswoman Hope Hicks join him at the podium (she smiled and wished the crowd a \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d) and, earlier, his first Senate backer, Jeff Sessions, took over the mic. Later, Mr. Trump gave his account of Nov. 8, claiming that halfway through election night he wanted to switch venues with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, which had rented out a convention center on the west side of Manhattan.  \u201cI took sort of a small ballroom because if I lost, I wanted to get out,\u201d Mr. Trump jokingly explained. He added that his campaign had even offered to buy the fireworks ordered by the Clinton team because \u201cI found fireworks just don\u2019t work when you lose.\u201d The last stop on what was billed as a \u201cThank You\u201d tour, Mobile was an appropriate place for the president-elect to reminisce on his year-and-a-half long journey to the White House: It was in the state where Mr. Trump won one of his largest margins of victory, where Sessions (now his attorney general pick) first publicly jumped aboard the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d train and where, as the president-elect said, people began to think \u201csomething was really going on there.\u201d  But the jaunt through Mobile was also an attempt to look toward Jan. 20, his inauguration, and the four years to come.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to the old days,\u201d the president-elect said, with an economic agenda that included the promise to \u201cbuy American and hire American.\u201d  \u201cMade in the USA, remember?\u201d he asked.  Mr. Trump once again promised to build \u201ca great wall\u201d that would stop illegal immigration \u201cfor good.\u201d He added, however, that \u201cwe will have doors in that wall,\u201d where people can come through -- legally -- \u201cby the tens of thousands.\u201d \u00a0 The president-elect did not address the latest reports of Russia hacking during the U.S. election season. At the conclusion, Mr. Trump addressed first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s recent remarks about a hopeless America, pushing back on the notion and saying \u201cwe have tremendous hope.\u201d  \u201cI actually think she made that statement not meaning it the way it came out,\u201d he said, referring to an interview with Oprah Winfrey that\u2019s scheduled to be broadcast Monday.  \u201cNow we\u2019re feeling what not having hope feels like. You know? Hope is necessary. It\u2019s a necessary concept,\u201d Mrs. Obama told Winfrey in a clip released in advance. \u201cAnd Barack didn\u2019t just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes. I mean, he and I and so many believe that if you -- what else do you have if you don\u2019t have hope?\u201d The president-elect countered that by saying of his administration and the country as a whole: \u201cWe have tremendous potential.\u201d  \u201cWe are going to be so successful as a country again,\u201d he vowed.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump continued his post-election \u201cthank you\u201d tour on Tuesday with a speech in North Carolina, and formally introduced his pick for secretary of Defense, Gen. James Mattis.  In the speech, which lasted a bit longer than half an hour, Mr. Trump stuck to a more optimistic tone than the one he had on the campaign trail. Noting that North Carolina was the home to both the Army\u2019s Fort Bragg and the Marine Corps\u2019 Camp Lejeune, Mr. Trump repeatedly praised American veterans before insisting that he would keep the promises he made prior to his election. Mr. Trump said that he would revitalize America\u2019s armed forces but only use them \u201cwhen it\u2019s in the vital interest of the United States.\u201d He promised \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d and an end to the caps on military spending resulting from sequestration.  Mr. Trump also introduced the crowd to Gen. Mattis, whom he repeatedly referred to by his nickname \u201cMad Dog.\u201d  \u201c\u2019Mad Dog\u2019 plays no games, right?\u201d Mr. Trump said to hoots and hollers from the crowd.  The general then spoke briefly, thanking Mr. Trump for the \u201cconfidence you have shown in me.\u201d Mattis then said that he looked \u201cforward to being the civilian leader\u201d of the Defense Department, assuming Congress grants him a waiver to serve despite his recent military service and the Senate consents to his nomination.  After Mattis left the stage, Mr. Trump said there will be \u201ca lot of angry people\u201d should Mattis not receive the waiver, which would allow him to become secretary of defense even though he retired from the military in 2013. According to federal rules, a secretary of defense must be at least seven years removed from service in the armed forces.  Mr. Trump then pivoted to a discussion of the economy and jobs, promising \u201cbold structural reform\u201d that will bring more and better economic opportunities for American workers. He said that he would lower taxes dramatically, and insisted he would implement \u201cmassive tax cuts\u201d for the middle class. The president-elect also promised to \u201cget rid of all the unnecessary regulations\u201d and secure energy independence. Invoking President Theodore Roosevelt, the originator of the National Parks system, Mr. Trump also said he would \u201cpreserve and protect\u201d America\u2019s national resources, in part for the good of hunters such as his two adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.  After noting how his come-from-behind victory had surprised many, Mr. Trump said Hispanics and African-Americans, whom he \u201cdid so well\u201d with, would quickly be beneficiaries of his proposed infrastructure investments, particularly those in the \u201cinner cities.\u201d  Trade, a major focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s during the campaign, was also discussed, with the president-elect decrying what he called \u201cthe greatest jobs theft in history\u201d due to poorly-negotiated trade agreements. And he touted Tuesday\u2019s commitment from Japanese industrialist Masayoshi Son to invest $50 billion in the United States.  Meanwhile, companies that outsource jobs, he said, would face \u201cconsequences.\u201d  \u201cWe will defeat the enemy on jobs, and we will defend American jobs,\u201d Mr. Trump said, likening the loss of jobs due to international trade as a war. Additionally, he said he would make access to \u201csafe and affordable child care for all\u201d a priority, a policy that has been promoted by his daughter, Ivanka Trump.  \u201cDid anybody ever hear of Ivanka Trump?\u201d he said, to cheers from the crowd. Mr. Trump also said he \u201csupport the incredible men and women of law enforcement,\u201d and insisted his proposed repeal of Obamacare would lead to a \u201cmuch lower price\u201d and \u201cmuch lower deductable\u201d for insurance.\u00a0 Continuing with pledges made prior to his election, Mr. Trump said that his would be the administration that \u201cended illegal immigration\u201d and built a wall along the southern border. He said \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of immigrants would still come to the U.S., but that they would arrive legally, and would not be allowed to come from regions where he says it would be too difficult to screen them.  Mr. Trump also said that, under his presidency, \u201cwe will respect out great American flag again,\u201d an apparent reference to his tweet earlier this week calling for people who burn it to face criminal charges, and perhaps a loss of citizenship.  Mr. Trump closed the speech by thanking the people of North Carolina, a state he won, and promising that America\u2019s best days still lay ahead.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "On the whole, a new president\u2019s Cabinet picks have been overwhelmingly confirmed: in the last four decades, just five Cabinet secretary picks have withdrawn their names after being nominated and only one (John Tower, George H.W. Bush\u2019s pick for defense secretary) has been rejected by the Senate. But some of Mr. Trump\u2019s selections -- chiefly ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of State -- have seen pushback not just from Senate Democrats, but a handful of Senate Republicans as well. Republicans like John McCain, Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham have expressed concerns about his ties to and business dealings with Russia.  With a 52-48 margin in the Senate, even a few Republican defections could spell trouble for a Cabinet nominee -- and deal a political blow to Mr. Trump during his early days in office. Will Tillerson be confirmed? And will any other Cabinet nominees have trouble?  When a new president takes office, he (or she) usually has a limited amount of time in which to ride new political capital -- that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much emphasis put on a president\u2019s first 100 days.  Both Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have outlined a series of top priorities beginning next month: in a November video statement, Mr. Trump said his priorities in the first 100 days include formally withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, canceling environmental restrictions, cut business regulations, enact a lobbying ban for his administration, shore up the country\u2019s defenses against cyberattacks and investigate visa programs and abuses.\u00a0 In Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan has said that repealing the Affordable Care Act is priority number one. Which of those things happen first, and which of them ultimately take longer to accomplish?  Despite many Republicans\u2019 objections to Mr. Trump, he ultimately gave them their wildest dream on Election Day: not only the White House, but both houses of Congress. In the wake of that victory, many Republicans -- including Ryan -- have buried the hatchet with Mr. Trump in the hopes of working together. But the fact remains that the Republican Party spent much of 2016 having a battle over its identity and its future -- and that doesn\u2019t just get buried now that Mr. Trump is taking over at the White House and other Republicans want to make nice with him. Mr. Trump has some serious political and policy differences with Republican orthodoxy, from his stance on trade agreements to his views on Russia. How able is the Republican Party to stay united once they hold the reins to govern? And if we do see a major split between the Trump White House and the GOP-led Congress, what\u2019s the first issue to cause it? With Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss and President Obama\u2019s imminent departure from the White House, the Democrats are a party without a leader. This is true in a broad sense, but is also literally true: the Democratic National Committee is in the midst of a race to elect its next chair, a race that says a lot about where the party is headed.  As Democrats contend with a President Trump early next year, they do so without a unified strategy for combating Mr. Trump -- and without anyone to articulate that strategy. Who steps up to fill the party\u2019s leadership void?  As was just mentioned, Democrats are in the midst of a campaign for their next DNC chair -- a race that is in many ways a proxy war between wings of the Democratic Party who envision very different futures for the party.  There\u2019s one school of thought that says Democrats neglected the white working-class voters by focusing too much on identity politics in an attempt to recreate the Obama coalition. Others say the 2016 loss was more the result of Clinton\u2019s inability to energize and mobilize that Obama coalition. Democrats on the more establishment side hint that the party may need to moderate some of its views; progressives argue that the party must move left, particularly on economic issues, in order to reach more lower-income voters.\u00a0 Who helms the DNC says a lot about what the Democratic Party message will be going forward and whether the party learns the right kinds of lessons from 2016. Republicans will control the White House and both houses of Congress for the first time since 2006 -- and congressional GOPers have made it clear that repealing the Affordable Care Act is among their very highest priorities. But it\u2019s still unclear exactly what Republicans would do as an alternative. Some members -- including Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for the Department of Health and Human Services, Rep. Tom Price (R-Georgia) -- have put forth proposals, but there\u2019s been no real indication of a party-wide consensus around any particular solution. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump said the replacement would be \u201cfantastic\u201d but had few -- if any -- details of what the replacement might entail. \u201cWe\u2019ll have private health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I\u2019m president,\u201d is how he put it at one Republican primary debate last February.\u00a0 As discussions about repealing the ACA get real under a new Congress, what kind of health care plan do Republicans propose? And can Mr. Trump and the GOP Congress agree on one? Every president deals with unexpected crises -- the kinds of things that former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld referred to as \u201cunknown unknowns.\u201d  For President Obama, some of those crises have included natural disasters (Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Matthew, for example), major pandemics (Ebola, Zika) and terror attacks (the Orlando shooting, the San Bernardino shooting, and more). How a president reacts to situations outside his or her control says a lot about the kind of person and the kind of leader they are. What will Mr. Trump\u2019s first big test be, and how does he handle it?  It\u2019s no secret that Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump hold drastically different views on a whole host of political and policy questions -- but perhaps nowhere is that difference more pronounced than when it comes to the U.S. relationship with Russia.  With U.S. intelligence agencies \u00a0alleging that Russia deliberately worked to influence the U.S. election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor, that divide has become even clearer. The Obama White House is currently\u00a0readying a response to Russia over the hacking allegations, and Mr. Obama has spoken harshly about Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s attempts to meddle on this side of the Atlantic.\u00a0 On the other hand, Mr. Trump has dismissed the CIA and FBI\u2019s assertions and said Democrats who accuse Russia are politically motivated. Trump also repeatedly spoke of his desire for the U.S. to have a better relationship with Putin on the campaign trail, and has been largely unwilling to criticize the Russian leader.\u00a0 What does the U.S.-Russia relationship look like under Mr. Trump? Does he get as close with Putin as his words and actions have suggested he will? Mr. Trump began backtracking on his campaign promises just days after being elected: he suggested there might be parts of the Affordable Care Act he\u2019d be interested in keeping, said he doesn\u2019t actually plan to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton, and has said the U.S.-Mexico border wall that was a centerpiece of his campaign could include some fencing.  New presidents frequently change their tune a bit after getting elected. But some of those shifts have already begun to rankle his supporters, many of whom took him at his word when he said he planned to \u201cLock her up\u201d (regarding Clinton) or build that wall. And as Mr. Trump adjusts to the reality of governing, there will surely be other campaign promises that don\u2019t ultimately happen. The question is just how many of those broken campaign promises there are -- and whether his supporters understand and stick by him.  Mr. Trump himself has referred to his victory as \u201cBrexit plus-plus-plus\u201d -- a nod to the United Kingdom\u2019s vote last June to leave the European Union. Both the Brexit vote in June and Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November have been seen as the potential start to a rise of\u00a0right-wing populist \u00a0movements across the Western world.  It\u2019s unclear whether other populist movements will triumph or collapse, however. Earlier this month, Austrian voters rejected the Freedom Party\u2019s Norbert Hofer, who would have been the first far-right head of state in Europe since World War II; the same day, Italians voted against a set of proposed constitutional reforms that resulted in the resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi, which was seen as victory for populists.\u00a0 Next year, far-right populism will get tested at the ballot box in a handful of important European countries. On March 15, the Netherlands votes in its general election, with the Freedom Party\u2019s Geert Wilders, a populist running on an anti-immigration platform, potentially poised to become prime minister. In April and May, far-right French National Front leader Marine Le Pen is likely to advance to the final round of France\u2019s presidential election. And in the fall, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Christian Democrats will face the growing momentum of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD). Which places see big victories for far-right groups -- and how does that shape the group of world leaders that used to include people like Mr. Obama, Renzi and the UK\u2019s David Cameron?

            "article_content": "The following script is from \u201cThe Speaker of the House,\u201d which aired on Dec. 4, 2016. Scott Pelley is the correspondent. Robert Anderson and Aaron Weisz, producers. For Donald Trump\u2019s agenda to become reality it must pass through the office of the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Ryan didn\u2019t want Trump to be president. The men threw ugly names at one another and Ryan refused to campaign for Trump. But elections have a way of proving that old adage that politics makes strange bedfellows. We spoke with Ryan on Thursday in his Capitol office about a partnership that may become the most scrutinized in Washington.  Scott Pelley: How often are you speaking to the president-elect? Paul Ryan: About every day. Scott Pelley: Do you call him, or does he call you? Paul Ryan: Both. Scott Pelley: When you call over to the-- Paul Ryan: He answers his cell phone. I sh-- probably shouldn\u2019t say that on TV. He just-- he just answers the phone. Scott Pelley: You call Donald Trump on his cell phone? Paul Ryan: All the time. Scott Pelley: And how does he answer? What does he say? Paul Ryan: He says, \u201cHi, hello.\u201d Scott Pelley: He doesn\u2019t say, \u201cThis is the president-elect?\u201d Paul Ryan: No. He\u2019s a pretty casual guy. He calls me Paul. I call him Mr. President-elect, because I just-- I have a reverence for the office. But yeah, he\u2019s very casual about it. Scott Pelley:\u00a0 \u201cHey, this is Paul. And here\u2019s-- here\u2019s something I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d Paul Ryan: Yeah, yeah. All the time. Scott Pelley: How long do those conversations go on? Paul Ryan: Twenty to 45 minutes. Scott Pelley: Have you told him being president is not being CEO of the United States, that the Congress is going to have a say? Paul Ryan: Oh, we\u2019ve talked about that extensively. We\u2019ve talked about the Constitution, Article I on the Constitution, the separation of powers. He feels very strongly, actually, that-- that, under President Obama\u2019s watch, he stripped a lot of power away from the Constitution, away from the Legislative Branch of government. And we want to reset the balance of power, so that people and the Constitution are rightfully restored. Scott Pelley: And that\u2019s what Donald Trump believes? He believes in the separation of power? You don\u2019t think he thinks he\u2019s going to run this country the way he wants to? Paul Ryan: No, I think he understands there\u2019s a Constitution. And that those separate but equal branches of government give us a limited government. And he believes that. Scott Pelley: You called Donald Trump a racist. Paul Ryan: No, I didn\u2019t. I said his comment was. Scott Pelley: Uh-huh (affirm). Well, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a great deal of daylight between those two definitions. But he definitely called you ineffective and disloyal. Have you patched it up? Paul Ryan: Yeah, we have. We\u2019re fine. We\u2019re not looking back. That\u2019s behind us. We\u2019re way beyond that. Now we\u2019re talking about how do we fix this country\u2019s problems. Scott Pelley: You know, I\u2019m curious, though. How did you patch it up? Who apologized to whom? How did that conversation go? Paul Ryan: We went fine. It was pretty much the day after the election or maybe two days after the election. And we basically decided to let bygones be bygones. And let\u2019s move forward and fix this country\u2019s problems. And it was over and done with. And ever since then, we\u2019ve had nothing but extremely productive conversations. Paul Ryan has led the majority in the House just over a year. He took the job, reluctantly when his predecessor gave up on trying to pull the fractured party together. Ryan is 46, from Wisconsin and an expert on the budget. Scott Pelley: What is the first bill you intend to pass? Paul Ryan: Well, the first bill we\u2019re going to be working on is our Obamacare legislation.  Scott Pelley: You\u2019re going to repeal it first? Paul Ryan: Yes. Scott Pelley: You\u2019re not pulling the rug out from under the 20 million people who already have-- Paul Ryan: No, no. We-- Scott Pelley: --Obamacare. Paul Ryan: We want to make sure that we have a good transition period, so that people can get better coverage at a better price. Scott Pelley: So what are we talking about? Months? Years? Paul Ryan: I can\u2019t give you an answer to that. We\u2019re still working on that. Scott Pelley: But people talked about three years in terms of a transition. Paul Ryan: Yeah, I don\u2019t know the answer to that right now. What we know is we have to make good on this promise. We have to bring relief as fast as possible to people who are struggling under Obamacare. Scott Pelley: What do Republicans intend to put in its place? Paul Ryan: Patient-centered healthcare that gets everybody access to affordable healthcare coverage. So they can buy what they what they want to buy.  Scott Pelley: So people will still get coverage regardless of their preexisting condition? Paul Ryan: Yeah. We think preexisting conditions is a very important feature of any healthcare system. Scott Pelley: Children will stay on their parents\u2019 plans until the age of 26? Paul Ryan: Yeah, that\u2019s something that we actually have always had in our plan, as well. Scott Pelley: And women will pay the same as men? That didn\u2019t used to be the case. Paul Ryan: It depends on the age of a person. So we believe that we should have support based on age. The sicker and the older you get, the more support you ought to get. If you\u2019re a person that has low income, you probably should have more assistance than a person with high income, for example. Scott Pelley: Is your plan going to cover everyone in America? Paul Ryan: We will give everyone access to affordable healthcare coverage. Scott Pelley: In the first year, what else do you expect to get through the Congress? Paul Ryan: We really want to focus on economic growth and growing the economy. There are a lot of regulations that are really just crushing jobs. Look at the coal miners in the Rust Belt that are getting out of work. Look at the-- look at the loggers and the timber workers and the paper mills in the West Coast. Look at the ranchers or farmers in the Midwest with regulations.  Scott Pelley: Are you talking about rolling back environmental regulations, safety regulations-- Paul Ryan: We\u2019re talking about smarter regulations that actually help us grow jobs in this country. We want to have good stewardship and conversation of the environment and economic growth. We have a real economic growth problem in America. We are limping along. Wages are flat.\u00a0 And jobs aren\u2019t being created near to the extent that they could and should be.\u00a0 So we think regulatory relief is very, very important.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to work on day one.  Ryan told us that he can now support Trump\u2019s changed positions on immigration from deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants to focusing on only those who\u2019ve committed crimes and from building a 2,000-mile wall to something less.  Paul Ryan: No, we\u2019re not working on a deportation force. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with respect to immigration, securing our border, enforcing our current laws. He talked about criminal aliens. That\u2019s just enforcing laws for people who came here illegally, who came and committed violent crimes. We should enforce those laws. But really, what we\u2019re focused on is securing our border.  Scott Pelley: Well, Trump said he was going to build a wall. Paul Ryan: Yeah, I think conditions on the ground determine what you need in a particular area. Some areas, you might need a wall. Some areas, you might need double fencing. I-- my own view on this is, whatever kind of device or barrier or policy to secure the border, that\u2019s necessary to secure the border, then do it. Scott Pelley: How big will the tax cut be for the middle class? Paul Ryan: Well, again, we haven\u2019t written this bill. But if you want to get a sense of what we\u2019re looking at it\u2019s virtually identical with the one that Donald Trump rolled out in the campaign. It means everyone gets lower tax rates. But we plug loopholes to pay for it. Scott Pelley: But give me a number. What is the tax cut for the average middle-class family. Paul Ryan: When I have a bill, I\u2019ll tell you the number. Let\u2019s do this again. Scott Pelley: You\u2019ve thought this through. You\u2019ve been thinking it through for years. What would you like to see? Paul Ryan: Yeah, so the tax rates that we talked about for individuals, we would have a 15 percent bracket, I think a 25 percent bracket, and a 33 percent bracket. We have seven brackets. We consolidate down to three. The other thing that\u2019s really important in tax reform is making sure that we don\u2019t tax American businesses at much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors tax theirs. It is costing us jobs. It\u2019s one of the reasons all these American companies are moving overseas.  Scott Pelley: What should the corporate tax rate be? Paul Ryan: Well, our plan says 20 percent. And Donald Trump\u2019s plan says 15 percent. It\u2019s now 35 percent. Scott Pelley: Do you think the rich will benefit the most from your tax reform plan? Paul Ryan: Here\u2019s the point of our tax plan. Grow jobs. Get this economy growing. Raise wages. Simplify the tax system, so it\u2019s easy to comply with. Scott Pelley: You-- you\u2019re a little shy, when I ask you about the rich receiving the greatest part of the-- Paul Ryan: Well, here\u2019s the problem when you-- Scott Pelley: --of the tax cuts. Paul Ryan: --when you ask these things. Most of that income is small-business income. You have to remember, eight out of 10 businesses in America, they file their business as individuals, as people. And so we think of that as the rich. But it\u2019s that business in the-- in the business park outta Jamesville, Wisconsin, that has 50 employees. And do I want to lower their tax rates? You bet I do. Scott Pelley:\u00a0 Mr. Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure program.\u00a0 What are you going to build, and how are you going to pay for it? Paul Ryan:\u00a0 Well, I think, that should be decided by the marketplace. That should be decided by the needs in the particular states and communities as to what is built or rebuilt. And it\u2019s going to be one of our high priorities that we\u2019re we are going to be addressing this year. Scott Pelley: One of your high priorities that we heard almost nothing about during the campaign is poverty. Paul Ryan: Actually, I\u2019ve talked to him a lot about that. We feel very strongly about making work pay, about getting people transitioned from welfare to work. Get people skills they need, help they need, so they can get on the ladder of life.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  Ryan told us he has no plans to change Social Security but government health insurance, including Medicare, is a fire he says burning in the budget. Paul Ryan: If you want to think of the fire that\u2019s burning-- it is the fact that-- the Baby Boom generation, no offense, and there\u2019s a lot of you. Scott Pelley: I qualify. Paul Ryan: Yeah, you qualify. And we\u2019re just not ready for the retirement of the Baby Boomers. And we\u2019d better prepare for that. Scott Pelley: What changes do you plan for Medicare? Paul Ryan: Here\u2019s the problem. Medicare goes bankrupt in about 10 years. The trust fund runs out of money. So we have to make sure that we shore this program up. And the reforms that we\u2019ve been talking about don\u2019t change the benefit for anybody who is in or near retirement. My mom\u2019s now enjoying Medicare. She\u2019s already retired. She earned it. But for those of us, you know, the X-Generation on down, it won\u2019t be there for us on its current path. So we have to bring reform to this program for the younger generation, so that it\u2019s there for us when we retire, and so that we can keep cash flowing to current generations\u2019 commitments. And the more we kick the can down the road, the more we delay, the worse it gets.  Scott Pelley: But you are going to kick the can down the road for the next year or two. This is not your top priority. Paul Ryan: It\u2019s not our t-- I haven\u2019t even discussed this with Donald Trump yet. But it is an issue that we have to tackle. From his balcony the speaker is watching the rise of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration platform. But, for Ryan, the best view in Washington isn\u2019t a pretty sight. Scott Pelley: You know, one thing I noticed during our interview inside was that every time you talked about the evils of Washington, you glanced out the window. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 I do, \u2018cause that\u2019s where all the bureaucracy\u2019s are. Yea. Yea. Yea. That\u2019s right. Scott Pelley: You think of this town as part of the problem not part of the solution. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 Absolutely I do. If you look down, I can see HHS, Education, EPA.\u00a0  Scott Pelley: The two most prominent things on the skyline from this vantage point are the Washington Monument and the new Trump Hotel.  Paul Ryan:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I knew you were going to say.\u00a0  Scott Pelley: The new Trump Hotel. Paul Ryan: That\u2019s the new Trump Hotel.\u00a0 Yeah he notic\u2014he actually noted that when I took him up here. Scott Pelley:\u00a0 I bet he did, he probably told you what a great place it was. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 He said something like that. Scott Pelley: Is that a reminder of who\u2019s boss? Paul Ryan:\u00a0 The Washington Monument\u2019s the tallest one.\u00a0 And by the way, the dome, it\u2019s a little higher. Beneath the dome, Ryan will have a front row seat to Trump\u2019s swearing in. Scott Pelley: Did you believe he could be nominated? Really? Paul Ryan: Yeah, no, I-- I didn\u2019t see this one coming. He knows that. I don\u2019t think most people in the country saw. If you would\u2019ve put last year into a movie script and taken it to Hollywood two years ago, they would\u2019ve laughed you outta the room. Because it wouldn\u2019t have been believable. Scott Pelley: Did you see Election Night coming? Paul Ryan: No, not really. I think-- Scott Pelley: You expected Hillary Clinton to win? Paul Ryan: I thought the odds were clearly in her favor. So I was a little surprised, pleasantly so. Scott Pelley: Do you trust him? Paul Ryan: Yeah.\u00a0  Scott Pelley:\u00a0 Here\u2019s something many people wonder. Does he say the same bizarre things to you in private that he says in public?\u00a0 And it\u2019s an important distinction\u2014 Paul Ryan:\u00a0 You know, I think there is a bit of a difference between the private person and the public person. In the private person, there\u2019s a conversation like this. And it\u2019s all about how to get things done. So every conversation I have almost always revolves around, you know, personnel and policy focused on producing results.\u00a0  Scott Pelley: Trump tweeted, in the last week or so, that he had actually won the popular vote, if you deduct the millions who voted illegally. Do you believe that? Paul Ryan: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not really focused on these things. Scott Pelley: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You have an opinion on whether millions of Americans voted illegally. Paul Ryan: I have no way of backing that up. I have no knowledge of such things. Scott Pelley: You don\u2019t believe that\u2014 Paul Ryan: But I don\u2019t-- it doesn\u2019t matter to me. He won the election.  But how, we asked, does he negotiate with a man whose word, or tweets, cannot always be believed? Paul Ryan: Look, like I said, he\u2019s going to-- the way I see the tweets you\u2019re talking about, he\u2019s basically giving voice to a lot of people who have felt that they were voiceless. He\u2019s communicating with people in this country who\u2019ve felt like they have not been listened to. He\u2019s going to be an unconventional president. I really think we have a great opportunity in front of us to fix problems, produce results, and improve people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here in the first place. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s going to matter at the end of the day. Did we improve people\u2019s lives? Did we solve the problems that the American people need solved? Are we addressing the concerns of people who are tired of being tired? And who cares what he tweeted, you know, on some Thursday night, if we fix this country\u2019s big problems? That\u2019s just the way I look at this. Correspondent, \"60 Minutes\"",

            "article_content": "Three weeks out from Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 presidential campaign, his transition team has already begun rolling out a series of top staff hires and Cabinet picks. There are just over 4,000 political appointments to be made by the incoming Trump administration. About 1,200 of them will require Senate confirmation \u2014 the Cabinet secretaries and their deputies, as well as those appointees who will head independent agencies, like the CIA and EPA, for instance. These nominees will go through a vetting process and Senate hearing.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a list of the top Cabinet and staff announcements Mr. Trump\u2019s team has made so far, beginning with the most recent: Energy Secretary: Rick Perry Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who once said he\u2019d like to eliminate the Energy Department, sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and again in 2016, when Mr. Trump eventually captured the nod. The former Texas governor sits on two corporate boards - one of them is Energy Transfer Partners - and that may present a confirmation issue. Energy Transfer Partners has a subsidiary known as Dakota Access LLC, which is attempting to build the\u00a0Dakota Access Pipeline. Recently, the Obama administration blocked the Dakota Access Pipeline easement through Lake Oahe, a move that jeopardized the 1,172-mile underground pipeline. The incoming Trump administration has said it will review the decision. Perry has been tapped to lead an agency he has suggested should be shut down. Although when Perry ran for the 2012 GOP nomination, during a debate, he famously forgot the name one of the three agencies he had pledged to eliminate. \u201cThe third agency of government I would -- I would do away with Education, the --Commerce...Commerce and, let\u2019s see. I can\u2019t. The third one, I can\u2019t. Sorry -- oops,\u201d he said. Later in the debate, Perry remembered, \u201cIt was the Department of Energy that I was reaching for before.\u201d Secretary of State: Rex Tillerson Tillerson is the CEO of ExxonMobil, the largest oil company in the world. It operates in dozens of countries -- including Russia, which has sparked controversy recently for the Kremlin\u2019s alleged involvement in the U.S. elections -- and has oil and natural gas interests on six continents. The confirmation process for Tillerson could prove highly contentious, with some leading lawmakers already voicing concern about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tillerson and Putin met in the 1990s when Tillerson worked for Exxon in Russia during Boris Yeltsin\u2019s presidency and Putin worked for Yeltsin\u2019s KGB with an eye toward Russian economic revitalization. Tillerson\u2019s work had him dealing with Russian companies and the Russian government on a frequent basis. At Putin\u2019s behest, the Kremlin conferred on Tillerson Russia\u2019s Order of Friendship in 2013. The state decoration rewards foreign nationals whose work has been aimed at bettering relations with Moscow. Labor Secretary: Andy Puzder Puzder is the CEO of CKE Restaurants, which owns fast food restaurants Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s.\u00a0 If he is confirmed by the Senate, the Labor Department would be led by a man who opposes dramatically raising the minimum wage. Puzder has argued that a higher minimum wage cuts profitability, forces businesses to cut jobs and increases reliance on automation. Another assertion he\u2019s made is that raising the minimum wage does nothing structurally to break the cycle of poverty for the working poor. Like Mr. Trump, Puzder also favors repealing and replacing Obamacare. In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, he blamed rising health insurance premiums for reductions in restaurant revenues. He wrote that consumers, feeling pinched by premiums were also eating at home because of lower grocery-store prices, and that has resulted in \u201cwhat you might call a government-mandated restaurant recession.\u201d Homeland Security Secretary: Retired Gen. John Kelly Kelly is the third general tapped by the president-elect,\u00a0joining Gen. James Mattis, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick to become the next secretary of Defense,\u00a0and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming national security advisor. Like Mattis, Kelly is a Marine with a reputation for bluntness. Kelly was the commander of U.S. Southern Command until earlier this year. In that posting, he oversaw American military operations in South America and Central America. Before that, he commanded American forces numerous times in Iraq, and spent a year as the top Marine in that country. He then was an aide to defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates. Kelly, who served nearly 46 years in the Marine Corps, is the highest-ranking American military official to lose a child in combat since 9/11. His son, Marine Lt. Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2010.\u00a0 Housing and Urban Development Secretary: Ben Carson Carson, who has never held elected office and failed earlier this year in a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, speculated to Fox News before Thanksgiving that\u00a0Mr. Trump\u2019s consideration for the HUD position\u00a0was in part due to Carson\u2019s upbringing. \u201cI grew up in the inner city and have spent a lot of time there, and have dealt with a lot of patients from that area and recognize that we cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner cities,\u201d he said Tuesday. The 65-year-old has no previous policy experience in the field of urban development. Defense Secretary: Retired Gen. James Mattis Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general and decorated war veteran, is a known opponent of the current White House policy on Iran, arguing that nothing has been done to counter Iran\u2019s threat to stability in the Middle East. He has been a vocal critic of the Iran nuclear deal, saying earlier this year that it was \u201can arms control agreement that fell short.\u201d\u00a0 If confirmed, Gen. Mattis, 66, is likely to deter Trump from engaging in isolationism and negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mattis has doubts about Russia\u2019s intentions, saying it wants \u201cto break NATO apart.\u201d The retired general also opposes waterboarding, a torture technique that Mr. Trump has promised he would legalize in the fight against ISIS.\u00a0 Mattis, however, could face a legal roadblock to his senate confirmation. The law specifically prohibits a person from serving as chief of the Defense Department \u201cwithin seven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force.\u201d Mattis retired in 2013. The Trump administration will have to seek a congressional waiver for the appointment, allowing Mattis to serve. Commerce Secretary: Wilbur Ross An ally during Trump\u2019s election campaign, the 79-year-old Ross is the billionaire chairman of WL Ross & Co., an investment firm that specializes in corporate restructurings. During the campaign, Ross often appeared on business news shows to explain Trump\u2019s positions, sometimes softening or downplaying the candidate\u2019s protectionist trade policies.  Ross built his estimated $2.9 billion fortune by snapping up distressed industrial businesses, such as steelmaker LTV. Ross might be best known to voters as the owner of Sago Mine, a West Virginia coal mine where a dozen miners lost their lives in a 2006 explosion. He called that tragedy \u201cthe worst week of my life.\u201d  Treasury Secretary: Steven Mnuchin Mr. Trump announced Wednesday morning that he\u2019d selected Mnuchin, who served as the national finance chairman of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, for the top Treasury Department job. This has been widely expected since Mr. Trump won the race for the White House. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u2019s transition recommended Mnuchin for the post. Mnuchin is a veteran of the finance world, spending 17 years at Goldman Sachs. Others who were reportedly considered for the job include JP Morgan Chase & CO CEO Jamie Dimon and Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas). Transportation Secretary: Elaine Chao\u00a0 Elaine Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush, is the first Asian-American woman to ever hold a Cabinet-level position. She served in the role from 2001 to 2009 \u2014 the only member of Bush\u2019s Cabinet to serve through his entire eight years in the White House. Before serving as labor secretary, Chao ran the United Way of America, was director of the Peace Corps and served as deputy treasury secretary under President George H.W. Bush. She is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). Health and Human Services Secretary: Tom Price Price, a five-term congressman hailing from the Atlanta suburbs, is the chairman of the House Budget Committee. He\u2019s an orthopedic surgeon by trade, and was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy. Price has also been a strong advocate, like his fellow Republicans, of repealing Obamacare. Price favors expanding health savings accounts and providing tax credits for purchasing health coverage. Education Secretary: Betsy DeVos\u00a0 Betsy DeVos, a prominent charter school advocate from Michigan, has also chaired the state\u2019s Republican party. She currently serves as chairwoman of the American Federation for Children, a school choice advocacy group. She and her husband also head up the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation, which has supported projects like the West Michigan Aviation Academy, a public charter school in Grand Rapids and the Compass Film Academy, a Christian film school in Michigan.  The billionaire DeVos family also owns the NBA team, the Orlando Magic. Dick DeVos\u2019 father founded Amway.  Attorney General: Jeff Sessions\u00a0 Sessions has been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest and most consistent allies, and he was the first senator to announce his support for the president-elect. An architect of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration, counterterrorism and trade policies, Sessions was also considered for secretary of defense. Appointing him the nation\u2019s top prosecutor is sure to be controversial, though: he\u2019s been through the Senate confirmation process before, with mixed success. \u00a0He did make it through a Republican-controlled Senate in 1981, when they approved him to be the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. But then, nominated for a federal judgeship in 1986, Sessions, R-Ala., was dogged by accusations that he had made racist comments while serving as U.S. attorney. \u00a0 EPA Administrator: Scott Pruitt Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, known for his strong opposition to President Obama\u2019s environmental regulations, could oversee the rollback of the administration\u2019s climate protection measures. As Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, Pruitt has sued the Obama administration over the climate rules for power plants.\u00a0 Pruitt has also questioned the idea that humans bear any responsibility for global warming -- a position that goes against widespread scientific consensus.\u00a0 In one National Review op-ed he co-wrote with Alabama\u2019s attorney general, Pruitt said this of climate change: \u201cHealthy debate is the lifeblood of American democracy, and global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.\u201d CIA Director: Mike Pompeo\u00a0 Pompeo, a Kansas congressman first elected during the tea party wave of 2010, serves on the Energy and Commerce and House Intelligence committees, and he also served on the House Select Benghazi Committee. According to his website, he\u2019s the former CEO of an oilfield company and also of an aerospace company he founded. And Pompeo is also a Harvard-trained lawyer who graduated first in his class at West Point.  National Security Adviser: Michael Flynn\u00a0 Flynn, a lifelong Democrat, is a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) -- he was one of the highest-ranking national security officials supporting Trump, whom he also informally advised him on foreign policy during the primary campaign. He is also known to be a proponent of stronger ties with Russia, as well as a critic of President Obama. Trump had at one point reportedly considered Flynn for vice president before choosing Mike Pence.",

            "article_content": "In the week since the greatest political upset in modern history -- the election of Donald Trump as America\u2019s 45th president -- Wall Street has been ebullient.  The Dow Jones industrials index notched yet another a new record closing high on Monday, fueled by a surge in financial and \u201chard economy\u201d stocks. Yet as raw emotion gives way to reason and reflection, many investors are realizing that Trump\u2019s economic policies may not all be benign, and the downside costs and risks for stocks may not adequately accounted for.\u00a0 Indeed, weakness in other markets such as Treasury bonds and emerging market currencies belies this dynamic.  In broad strokes, this chart shows three possible economic futures: It was put together by Gregory Daco at Oxford Economics, who wonders whether all the post-election enthusiasm over the prospect of lower taxes, higher spending and reduced regulation has blinded investors to the threats of \u201cincreased policy uncertainty, more trade protectionism, congressional fiscal orthodoxy and stricter immigration\u201d -- all of which could frustrate Trump\u2019s plans.  Indeed, worries over import tariffs and a reduction in the skilled H1B visas Silicon Valley relies on to keep labor costs low have hit tech stocks hard over the past week -- widening the performance gap between the Dow industrials and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index to a level not seen since the financial crisis. Apple (AAPL), the single most important stock in terms of market capitalization, has fallen more than 10 percent from its late October high.  The wide variety of possible outcomes Daco modeled could result in anything from a new recession in 2019 to a return to a 3 percent-plus GDP growth rate.  His baseline, or middling, outlook assumes a compromise between President Trump and Congress that results in a modest fiscal stimulus and targeted trade protectionism. Private industry would get a lift from lower taxes and increased spending on roads, bridges and schools. That would be offset by a tightening of trade terms and potential retaliation from trading partners.  The result is GDP growth of just 2 percent in 2017 and 1.8 percent in 2018, with a single rate hike from the Federal Reserve in 2016 and again in 2017.  The upside scenario sees GDP growth roughly double from its current underlying pace. It assumes tax cuts are twice as large as in the baseline forecast (worth $1 trillion over the next decade), focusing on low-income families, who have a greater propensity to spend their savings, and greater spending on infrastructure. To placate the budget hawks in Congress, Trump would swap easier trade terms for a larger debt ceiling.  The result is a U.S. economy that\u2019s 2 percent larger by 2020 and has 2 million more jobs.  The downside scenario would see the relationship between the Trump faction and establishment Republicans in Congress break down over his tendencies toward aggressive nationalism. This would come to a head during debt-ceiling negotiations, which will happen as soon as March.\u00a0 Congress could balk at projections from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that Trump\u2019s current proposals would result in a doubling of the national debt save for drastic nonentitlement budget cuts and much faster-than-anticipated economic growth.  Under this scenario, a new recession would hit within the next two years and result in an economy 5 percent smaller, employing 4 million fewer Americans by the end of Trump\u2019s term.  A similar \u201cwhat if\u201d analysis by Goldman Sachs (GS) found that the potential economic outcomes under Trump range from an upside of GDP growth accelerating to a 2.6 percent rate by 2018 to a downside \u201cstagflation\u201d forecast of a sub-1 percent stall in 2019 along with rising inflation and joblessness.\u00a0 Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

The ultimate outsider begins his transition to the highest office in the land amidst promise and protest. Will president-elect Trump change Washington, or will Washington change him? Will he keep his more controversial campaign promises, or is everything negotiable? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LESLEY STAHL, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: They\u2019re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress. Would you accept a fence? DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: For certain areas, I would. But certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: We will get a preview from his first post-election television interview that will air tonight on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Plus, can Trump unify the Republican Party and the nation? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We are now talking about how we are going to hit the ground running to make sure that we can get this country turned around and make America great again. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: We will talk with former Speaker of the House and Trump transition team member Newt Gingrich. And after a thorough defeat, Democrats look to rebuild. We will sit down with former presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders and talk about that and his new book. We will also hear from our politics panel and sit down with CBS News journalists you don\u2019t normally see on camera, our 2016 embedded campaign reporters. What did they learn from voters along the way? It\u2019s all ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson. President-elect Donald Trump sat down with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d\u2019 Lesley Stahl on Friday. She asked Mr. Trump which campaign promises he expects to keep. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STAHL: So, let\u2019s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you\u2019re going to do what you said or you\u2019re going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall? TRUMP: Yes. STAHL: They\u2019re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress. Would you accept a fence? TRUMP: For certain areas, I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I\u2019m very good at this. This is called construction. STAHL: So, part wall, part fence? TRUMP: But a fence will be -- yes, it could be -- there could be some fencing. STAHL: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants? TRUMP: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminals and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, a lot of these people, probably two million. It could even be three million. We\u2019re getting them out of our country or we\u2019re going to incarcerate. But we\u2019re getting them out of our country. They\u2019re here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that you\u2019re talking about who are terrific people. They\u2019re terrific people. But we\u2019re going to make a determination at that. But, before we make that determination, see, it\u2019s very important, we want to secure our border. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: More of Lesley Stahl\u2019s interview with Donald Trump and the Trump family will air on tonight\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d after football. Joining us now is former Speaker of the House and vice-chair of the Trump transition team Newt Gingrich. He is also the author of the upcoming novel \u201cTreason.\u201d Welcome, Mr. Speaker. Does Donald Trump have mandate? NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Well, I think, first of all, he won, and he won pretty decisively in the Electoral College. And I think the deeper thing is, the Republicans won the House. They won the Senate. They won the governorships, most governor -- most Republican governors in history, most Republican state legislators in history. So, if you look at the country, there is certainly a shift towards Republican government on a pretty big scale. DICKERSON: Is it a challenge for him that he didn\u2019t win the popular vote? GINGRICH: To some extent. But, remember, in 49 states, he had a 2.2 million-vote majority, and then there\u2019s California. We don\u2019t compete in California. The current rules of the game, we\u2019re not going to carry California. And it\u2019s a sad cycle. They don\u2019t invest because they\u2019re not going to carry, so they don\u2019t -- so it gets worse every year. If this had been a general election, where the total vote mattered, we would have competed in California. DICKERSON: Are you still a fan of getting rid of the Electoral College? You used to be. GINGRICH: Well, I think, in the long run, you want to find a way to have the whole country represented. But my point is, if we had total vote mattering, we would have competed in California. And we would have probably picked up at least two million votes just by competing. DICKERSON: Let\u2019s talk about the pace of change. Should Donald Trump swing for the fences or go for singles? GINGRICH: Swing for the fences. I have done this twice in my career. I did it with Reagan in \u201881. I did it as speaker in \u201895. This is a city which if you don\u2019t shove it as hard as you can while you have got momentum, it will just surround you. The swamp doesn\u2019t want to be drained, and the swamp will just suck you in if you let it. So, he needs to have a very, very aggressive first year. DICKERSON: When I covered your presidential race and run in 2012, you were -- you made a case for incrementalism. In two cases, you said, you know, when the country is as bitterly divided, and you put your name on a program and think any Democrat is going to vote for it, you have to go out -- your argument was, you have to go out and sell it and that you have to -- so explain how you swing for the fences, shove this country, but aren\u2019t moving too fast. GINGRICH: Well, two things. First of all, I recommend to all of our reviews that you read a terrific book called \u201cThe Education of Ronald Reagan,\u201d which really captures Reagan at General Electric and shows you what he learned about moving the country. So you have got to move the -- Trump has got to be the salesman. Second, take something big like infrastructure. He can work with Chuck Schumer on infrastructure. He can find a bipartisan path that allows us to dramatically improve infrastructure, something Trump knows an immense amount about. And you could have a very big bipartisan bill on infrastructure. I suspect, on tax reform, there\u2019s a chance to actually put together a tax reform package which also, as Speaker Paul Ryan has pointed out today, also means you can handle a lot of the tariff differentials inside the tax code in a way that could be very advantageous to American business. DICKERSON: Back in \u201812, you also said, \u201cWe got mad at Obama because he ran over us when we said don\u2019t do it. Well, Republicans ought to follow that same ground rule.\u201d Does that still apply? GINGRICH: I think it\u2019s very important that Trump try to have as many Democrats as possible help him do this, because one of the lessons of the Obama years is, if you do things that are big on the purely partisan basis, they\u2019re not stable. And I think Trump wants to change America to make it great again for a generation, not just for eight years. DICKERSON: What has he done since being elected president that made you think, gee, that\u2019s different? GINGRICH: Well, I mean, first of all, his speech on -- his victory speech was very conciliatory, very much in the right direction. I think his visit to the White House was very respectful on both sides, and I think encouraging in that sense. And I think his meeting with Paul Ryan and with Mitch McConnell and the fact that he\u2019s integrating Mike Pence so thoroughly, which also happened with Cheney. Remember, Cheney, as vice president, led the transition. Pence, as vice president, is going to lead the transition. I think all those things show you steps toward stability and maturity that are very, very encouraging. DICKERSON: Paul Ryan said today on CNN that there\u2019s not going to be a deportation force. Mr. Trump has said that he\u2019s going to incorporate some ideas of Obamacare, which he talked about on the stump, too. Now that he\u2019s president, are a lot of the things that seemed to be bright lines in the campaign, are they much more negotiable? GINGRICH: Well, I think if you listen to the brief section you aired from \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d there are going to be substantial deportations. They\u2019re called criminals. I mean, two million people would be a lot of people to deport. And if, at the same time, you can gain control of the border, and if you pass as guest-worker program, you would be a long way towards then, three or four or five years from now, dealing with the rest of the folks who are here without legal permission. And I think, by that stage, we would accommodate it in some way. I think, in terms of Obamacare, it\u2019s going to be repealed. But there are certain aspects of it that are very widely supported. And you don\u2019t want to capriciously take away the right of somebody to be on their parents\u2019 insurance until 26. You want to protect the right to have insurance coverage without any kind of precondition. But that means, if you\u2019re not going to have a mandate, which we\u2019re not, and it hasn\u2019t been effective -- they can\u2019t punish young people with taxes enough to get them to buy insurance. Then you better have a high-risk pool, which Paul Ryan has suggested, or some device, so that if you have a precondition, but you\u2019re not insured, you\u2019re still going to get health care. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about a sense of conflict in this country. There were 60 million people who didn\u2019t vote for Mr. Trump. Why should -- or help explain to somebody who didn\u2019t vote for him and to -- you know there are people going around saying, not my president. In part, Donald Trump rose to prominence by challenging the idea that Barack Obama was a legitimate president, said he wasn\u2019t born in America, there was no evidence to that, spent five years saying he was illegitimate. Why should anybody who doesn\u2019t like Donald Trump think, oh, well, I should think he is legitimate now? GINGRICH: Well, it\u2019s a question or whether or not you want America to be a successful venture. And I think, frankly, if you\u2019re hard left, it\u2019s very hard to imagine why you\u2019re going to accommodate a Trump presidency, because the two goals -- remember, George W. Bush was attacked from day one by the hard left. Obama was attacked from day one by conservatives. We have now been through 16 years of a siege warfare. And, interestingly, while we got involved in a fight with Clinton, no one ever attacked the legitimacy of the Clinton presidency or Bush I or Reagan or Carter, for that matter. DICKERSON: Part of what this stems from is the campaign that Mr. Trump ran. In \u201cThe National Review,\u201d Ian Tuttle writes about this divisive campaign. He says -- quote -- \u201cHis victory in the primaries gave unprecedented visibility to the alt-right, a small but vocal fringe of white supremacists and anti-Semites and self-proclaimed fascists. Supporting a President Trump cannot mean giving a pass to the ugly fringe that has risen with him.\u201d What does Donald Trump have to do to address that? GINGRICH: I just have to say that\u2019s garbage. DICKERSON: Even though it\u2019s coming from \u201cThe National Review\u201d? GINGRICH: Yes, I don\u2019t care where it -- this whole notion -- it\u2019s like \u201cThe Washington Post\u201d had this columnist the day who pointed out that we\u2019re on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, which was the night when the Nazis attacked Jewish businesses. And I\u2019m thinking, what is -- this is crazy. Donald Trump is a mainstream conservative who wants to profoundly take on the left. The left is infuriated that anybody would challenge the legitimacy of their moral superiority. And so the left goes hysterical. But the fact is -- and you get this all these smears of Steve Bannon. Steve Bannon was a naval officer. He was a managing partner of Goldman Sachs. He was a Hollywood movie producer. The idea that somehow he represents -- I had never heard of the alt-right until the nut cakes started writing about it. DICKERSON: But -- so your point is, it\u2019s garbage; therefore, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have to deal with... (CROSSTALK) GINGRICH: Donald Trump has to be Donald Trump. And the country will organize itself around who he is. DICKERSON: Does being Donald Trump mean keeping the Twitter account? What is your advice on that? GINGRICH: My advice to that is to always have an editor. DICKERSON: But still keep tweeting? (LAUGHTER) GINGRICH: No, sure. Look, it\u2019s a technique for reaching 13 or 14 million people at no cost and gets him around \u201cThe New York Times.\u201d DICKERSON: What do you want to do in this administration, if anything? GINGRICH: I want to help plan the restructuring of the federal government. DICKERSON: And so that sounds like a domestic role. GINGRICH: No, well, it\u2019s the restructuring of the federal government, including State and Defense. DICKERSON: One of the questions people had about Donald Trump is whether anyone can tell him no. Can anyone tell Donald Trump no? GINGRICH: Oh, maybe Ivanka or Melania. I don\u2019t know. DICKERSON: And... GINGRICH: And then I don\u2019t -- look, this is a very strong-willed guy who has risen in remarkable ways. He\u2019s worth $4 billion to $10 billion. He beat 15 other people for the nomination. He beat Secretary Clinton for the presidency. He took on virtually the entire national media and beat them. He has a great deal of faith in his own instincts. And you have to say, most days, he\u2019s more right than we were. DICKERSON: All right, Speaker Gingrich, thanks so much for being here. GINGRICH: Thank you. DICKERSON: While Republicans are enjoying their victories in the House, Senate and, of course, the White House, Donald Trump\u2019s opponents are scared, angry and vowing to never let the country forget what he said and did on the campaign trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: We reject the president-elect! (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: Tens of thousands took to the streets Saturday as protests continued for a fifth day across the country. And \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d took a break from the comedy to mourn the outcome. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \u201cSATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\u201d) KATE MCKINNON, ACTRESS (singing): And even though it all went wrong, I will stand before the lord of song with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: But Democrats are also in for some soul-searching, looking to recapture lost ground. As it happens, there\u2019s a new book coming out this week offering a road map for the party, Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In.\u201d And its author joins us now, a familiar fixture from campaign 2016, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Welcome, Senator Sanders. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: It\u2019s good to be with you, John. DICKERSON: So, one of the protest anthems going on about Donald Trump is \u201cnot my president.\u201d Is he your president? SANDERS: He won the election. I did everything I could to see that he not become elected, but he won. Our job now is to hold him accountable, you know? Mr. Trump claimed that he was the champion of the working class of this country. And, as you know, there are millions people who are working longer hours for low wages. They don\u2019t have any health care. They can\u2019t afford to send their kids to college. They can\u2019t afford child care. If Mr. Trump, in fact, has the courage to take on Wall Street, to take on the drug companies, to try to work forward, go forward to create a better life for working people, we will work with him on issue by issue. But if his presidency is going to be about discrimination, if it\u2019s going to be about scapegoating immigrants or scapegoating African-Americans or Muslims, we will oppose him vigorously. DICKERSON: A lot of Democrats are bereft at this outcome. And it\u2019s in the just a loss. It\u2019s that there are people who are shaken by this. What is your message to the Democrats? SANDERS: Our message is that we have to do a lot of rethinking and ask ourselves, how does it happen that we have a president, a U.S. Senate, a House, and most governorships around this country are controlled by people who want to give huge tax breaks to billionaires, in many instances, want to cut Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, who do not even believe in the concept, the understanding of climate change, which is virtually unanimously agreed to by the scientific community? How does it happen that they win elections and Democrats lose? And I think what the conclusion is, is that Democrats are focused too much with a liberal elite, which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people in the upper middle class, but has ignored to a very significant degree the working class and the middle class and low-income people in this country. Look, the truth is, in my view, this country is moving toward an of oligarchic form of society, where a handful of billionaires and large corporations control the economy. As a result of Citizens United, they now control our political system, where the Koch brothers and the billionaires can buy elections. They have undue influence over the media as well. And what the Democratic Party has got to say to working people, we are on your side. You know what? We are going to take on Wall Street. We\u2019re not going to take their money. We\u2019re going to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We\u2019re going to raise the minimum wage. We\u2019re not going to be the only country, major country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people. You have got to make a decision which side you\u2019re on. Democrats have got to stand with the working families of this country. DICKERSON: How do you read the election result? Was it a failure of Hillary Clinton to turn out Democrats to reach that voice or was it a victory for Donald Trump? SANDERS: I think it was both. I think Speaker Gingrich is right. I think Trump has very, very good political instincts. And what he understood, which many Democrats did not, is that if you are an average American out there making $30,000 $40,000 $50,000, you\u2019re working longer hours for low wages while almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. And you know what, John? You\u2019re pissed off. You\u2019re not happy about it. You\u2019re seeing your jobs go the China. Your kids can\u2019t afford to go to college. You can\u2019t buy the medicine that you need. You\u2019re worried to death about the future generation. Trump tapped that anger. Now, what our job is to do is to see, what is his solutions? All right. He talked about the problems. You think throwing 20 million people off of health care is a solution to the health care crisis? Is giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top two-tenths of 1 percent going to be the solution to income and wealth inequality? I don\u2019t think so. So, our job is to say, Mr. Trump, you talked about being the champion of the working families. All right, now produce. Your rhetoric was great. Now do something. But we will not accept racism. We will not accept sexism or xenophobia. DICKERSON: Do you think his campaign was built on that? Newt Gingrich said that idea was garbage. SANDERS: No, I\u2019m afraid Mr. Gingrich is wrong. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s all it was built on, but when you begin your campaign by talking about throwing 11 million people who are undocumented out of this country or building a wall with Mexico or preventing Muslims, one of the largest religions in this country, in the world, I should say, coming into this country, of course, to a large degree, it was built on that. DICKERSON: Democrats going forward, should they pay attention to the way you ran your campaign or the way Hillary Clinton ran hers? SANDERS: I think it\u2019s time -- it\u2019s not just Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. It\u2019s time to rethink whether or not the Democratic Party can simply spend so much time and energy raising money from wealthy people and putting ads on television. What we need to do is create a grassroots movement of millions of people who want to transform this country and make it the kind of country that we know that we can have. John, there is no rational reason why we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, no rational reason why we are the only major nation on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care for all people. We don\u2019t have paid family and medical leave. Why are our kids going to see a lower standard of living than their parents? We can transform this country. We\u2019re a wealthy country. We can do it. But we have to have the courage to stand up to the billionaire class and corporate America and Wall Street to do it. DICKERSON: All right, Senator Sanders, we are going to take a quick break. Then we are going to be back. We will talk about your book a little bit. So, we will be back in a moment with more from Senator Sanders. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we\u2019re back with more from Senator Bernie Sanders, who is not only a former presidential candidate, but the author of \u201cOur Revolution.\u201d Senator, is this the user\u2019s manual, owner\u2019s manual for the new Democratic revolution? SANDERS: I think it is, John. I mean, what I tried to do there, half of the book is talking about the campaign, why I ran for office, what we did well, what we didn\u2019t do well. The kind of excitement that we generated all over this country. But the other half of the book basically asks the question and tries to give the answer, how do we go forward? I am tired of watching television where you have a campaign which is about Mr. Trump\u2019s attitude toward women vs. Hillary Clinton\u2019s e- mails. You know what? Those are not the major issues facing America. The middle class of this country for 40 years has been in decline, massive levels of income and wealth inequality. Why? What can we do about it? Why do we not guarantee health care to all people? How do we create a health care system that\u2019s cost-effective and universal? What about our broken criminal justice system? Why do we have more people in jail than any other country? How do we invest in our young people, so we don\u2019t end up in jail? What about immigration reform? So, what that is, it says, we have to have as a nation, and the media has got to do it as well, John, a serious discussion about the serious issues facing America. And, by the way, what astounds me -- and I hope this changes very quickly -- is we now have a president-elect who actually does not believe that climate change is real. I worry very much what this means for our kids and our grandchildren and the future of this planet. And millions of people are going to have to tell him, Mr. Trump, you are dead wrong, and we\u2019re going to have to transform our energy system. DICKERSON: But are you talking about marches on Washington? Are you -- what\u2019s the action item for a nervous Democrat out there? SANDERS: Is to understand that, on virtually every major issue, raising the minimum wage, climate change, pay equity for women, rebuilding our infrastructure, making public colleges and universities tuition-free, we are the majority. That is what the American people want. And the Democrats will win elections by pounding away on those issues and talking about not giving tax breaks to billionaires, undoing Citizens United, a disastrous Supreme Court decision. So, we are the majority. And, by the way, let\u2019s not forget Hillary Clinton did win more votes than Mr. Trump did. So pound away on the issues that bring people together, fight vigorously against all forms of bigotry. DICKERSON: Who is the leader of the Democratic Party right now? SANDERS: Well, in the House, it\u2019s Nancy Pelosi. In the Senate, it is Chuck Schumer. DICKERSON: And you\u2019re OK with that? I mean, you think people should look to them for guidance? Or are there a lot of you? SANDERS: I\u2019m not into leaders. DICKERSON: Yes. SANDERS: I am into building a movement which transforms this country and brings people together around an agenda that works for the middle class and working families of this country. DICKERSON: Don\u2019t follow leaders. The next question is, Donald Trump has talked about infrastructure, spending a lot of money getting people working again. Sounds like something you could sign on to. SANDERS: If it is sensible infrastructure program, absolutely. Our infrastructure, roads, bridges, water systems, airports, rail, collapsing. We can put millions of people to work rebuilding the infrastructure. DICKERSON: And when you say sensible, it sounds like he\u2019s willing to spend a lot of money to do it, put people back to work. SANDERS: Let\u2019s see the details. But, in general, rebuilding our infrastructure is absolutely imperative for this country. DICKERSON: Is there another area where you could find common ground? SANDERS: Yes. I am very proud -- look, I have been a leader in opposition to disastrous trade agreements from the first day I was in the Congress. To the best of my knowledge, the TPP is now dead. I fought it. Hillary Clinton fought it. Mr. Trump is opposed to it. There is an area. Creating a trade policy so that corporate America starts investing in this country, not in China, yes, we can work together on that. DICKERSON: All right, Senator Sanders, we will look forward to having you back. Thanks so much for being here with us. And we will be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Coming up next, what to expect in a Trump administration with \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d columnist and CBS News contributor Peggy Noonan, Michael Gerson, a columnist for \u201cThe Washington Post.\u201d Jeffrey Goldberg is editor in chief of \u201cThe Atlantic.\u201d And Jamelle Bouie, chief political correspondent for Slate and also a CBS News political analyst. Also, tune in to FACE THE NATION again next week for an in-depth look at the policy challenges president-elect Donald Trump will face at home and abroad. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Some of our CBS stations are leaving us now, but, for most of you, we will be right back with a lot more of the results of the 2016 presidential election and what\u2019s next. That\u2019s next on FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson. We\u2019re back with our politics panel. Peggy Noonan of \u201cThe Wall Street Journal,\u201d Michael Gerson from \u201cThe Washington Post,\u201d Jeffrey Goldberg of \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d and \u201cSlate\u2019s\u201d Jamelle Bouie. Peggy, I want to start with you. Tough election. PEGGY NOONAN, \u201cTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL\u201d: Yes. DICKERSON: The country is split. There are -- more people voting for Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump, but he\u2019s the president. What does Donald Trump do to address that situation? NOONAN: Oh, it\u2019s probably always good to start out with a -- with a -- a central, yet banal, yet truthful insight like a kind word turnith away wrath, ratchet it down, be cool, be humble, be calm. I think that a lot of people will be looking at the staff members and appointees he makes over the next few weeks and trying to discern whether we see accomplished people who look like they can do this and are -- seen inherently moderate, or are -- are (ph) folks I know, or if it will be a little more unusual than that. One of the things I think that we\u2019ll see over the next six months say is that it\u2019s a mistake to discount the amount of pent-up energy there is in Capitol Hill on the Republican side. They\u2019ve got a House. They\u2019ve got a Senate. They haven\u2019t been able to do very much the past eight years. They haven\u2019t been able to move too many balls forward. I think there will be a lot of reason for a lot of people on The Hill to want to work happily and closely with Donald Trump and do big things, such as Newt Gingrich was talking about, infrastructure, as everybody is. Well, heck, do a big pow on that. DICKERSON: Yes. NOONAN: Take a serious look at taxes. Do something big. DICKERSON: Michael, is doing something big going to solve the aftermath of this in which you not only have Democrats who are unhappy, but there are a number of Republicans who were against Donald Trump who are now nervous and not sure? MICHAEL GERSON, \u201cTHE WASHINGTON POST\u201d: Well, the party\u2019s unified right now, but there is a split here. You know, some of the Trump coalition hates the Republican establishment, and some of the coalition is the Republican establishment. That\u2019s the way you have to run a government. So it\u2019s all sweetness and light until you start to pick personnel and start to make priority decisions on -- on governing. Some of that might be controversial things on executive orders, for example, with the dreamers or -- and we\u2019re going to have a Supreme Court fight almost immediately. So, yes, I think it\u2019s fine now. Republicans are unified by victory and the prospect of 6,000 jobs, which is what the president, you know, fills. And -- but I think we\u2019re going to see the fissures very soon in the source of the chief of staff. That\u2019s going to send the signal, you know, are they for conciliation or are they, you know, with -- with their base? DICKERSON: Jamelle, the -- on the one hand you have the president and Hillary Clinton and even Bernie Sanders saying, we\u2019ll try and work with the new president. And the other hand you have people marching in the street. Where does that go from here? JAMELLE BOUIE, \u201cSLATE MAGAZINE\u201d: I think this gets to the question of what President-Elect Trump can do to unify the country in the wake of this election. I think the people marching in L.A., on college campuses around the country, aren\u2019t marching simply because Trump was a Republican president and he got elected. They\u2019re marching because the Trump campaign is very much centered on demagogic rhetoric against immigrants, against Muslim-Americans, against black protest, against sort of America\u2019s non-white community. And in the wake of Trump\u2019s elections, there have been reports across the country of intimidation, harassment and violence against those very groups. So if Trump is serious about unifying the country, if this is a thing he wants to do, then I think he needs to immediately speak against these acts of intimidation, harassment and violence that are happening to some degree in the name of the campaign that he ran. DICKERSON: Jeffrey, what\u2019s your take on that? I mean Newt Gingrich said those charges are garbage. They\u2019re baloney. On the other hand, there is this feeling in the country, doesn\u2019t -- Donald Trump is now the president of the entire country. And if he were to speak to that, as Jamelle suggests, what would that even look like? JEFFREY GOLDBERG, \u201cTHE ATLANTIC\u201d: Well, I mean to unify what Peggy\u2019s saying and what Jamelle\u2019s saying, I think, is that if there\u2019s a -- if there\u2019s a moment for him to speak to the country broadly, as president-elect, not as a former reality TV star, it might be on this very question. He might do something large-hearted and articulate in a very specific way. I don\u2019t stand with the alt-right. I don\u2019t stand with racism. I reject the support of anybody affiliated with the KKK because I believe I want to be the president of all Americans. That would be the key signal to send that would actually calm the legitimate fears of a lot of people in America, citizens and people who are not yet citizens, and certainly undocumented people that -- that this is a fundamentally different kind of presidency than anything we\u2019ve seen before. That would be the most -- NOONAN: That would be really, really good. BOUIE: And I think this would get the -- GERSON: Yes, and Republicans have been waiting for that pivot for a year and a half. BOUIE: Right. GOLDBERG: That\u2019s right. GERSON: It\u2019s very hard to escape the practice or habits of a lifetime. And he has not been able to do so thus far. GOLDBERG: The good thing is, is that she\u2019s shocked now that he\u2019s president of the United States. GERSON: Yes, I agree (INAUDIBLE). GOLDBERG: And that hour and a half he spent with President Obama was a fairly shocking hour and a half for him, I\u2019m sure, on any number of levels. And maybe the pivot will come because he realizes that, I\u2019m not a reality TV star anymore. I have -- I have this job now. NOONAN: There are legitimate -- BOUIE: And I think the personnel decision will get to some of this, right? Two of the people in contention for chief of staff are Steven Bannon and Reince Priebus, the chair -- the chairman of the RNC. And I think if Trump chooses Steven Bannon, who is known for his associations with the website Breitbart, which is sort of a clearinghouse for these alt-right group, that will give us a sign of the kind of President Donald Trump intends to be, in the sense in which he is not aiming for any kind of unity with America\u2019s non-white population. NOONAN: Knock down the alt-right, show compassion and leadership towards those who are understandably nervous or even paranoid, but also deal with the fact that some people on the other side of Trump, some Democrats, some left liberal progressives, some have become quite unhinged. I was in the middle of a Trump -- an anti-Trump demonstration in Manhattan yesterday, and -- and it managed somehow to be smilingly enraged. They were having a good time, but they were enraged at the outcome of this election. Sometimes people have to be reminded, this is what democracy is. There are outcomes sometimes that you don\u2019t like. And you can\u2019t simply assume the worst. At a certain point you have to say, America, you made a decision. OK, we\u2019re going to watch now and soon we will be judging. GERSON: But it\u2019s hard when the worst people in the country are cheering, the people with the confederate flag, the people that do anti-Semitism on Twitter, that\u2019s difficult for a lot of people in this country. But, you know, I do think an inaugural, for example, is almost always an act of national healing. If they just go back and look at previous inaugurals back to Thomas Jefferson, healing divides. I mean that is a moment where your goal is to bring together the country in a substantive way to say that we\u2019re united by values and more -- that are -- you know, stronger than the things that divide us. That could be a moment. NOONAN: Yes. He may have to move sooner than that, though. That\u2019s January. BOUIE: And I think don\u2019t -- and I think -- and I think part of the -- part of the problem here is that Trump\u2019s campaign wasn\u2019t a typical lower case d campaign in democracy. It was, in a lot of ways, ill-liberal democracy campaign. A campaign that set out sort of explicitly that some people in this country aren\u2019t quite worth as more as other people in this country. And that -- that is the core of the -- the fear that is the core of the paranoia, if you want to call it that. That is what people are worried about. And that is what needs to be resolved. NOONAN: We have to remember also of 60 million people roughly who voted for Donald Trump. So many of them, they are just good, honest, decent, patriotic, wanting the best. They had an insight into their -- into our system, that it was broken and it need something dramatic. They just backed something dramatic, and they hope it will work. But the -- I understand the negativity that we have all seen, but there is profound decency, too. But it\u2019s not marching in the streets. Forgive me. GOLDBERG: I wouldn\u2019t deny what you just said about most of the people who voted for Trump. I would also say that to vote for Trump was to at least overlook the fact that we\u2019re talking about someone with a record of misogyny and racist invective. And so that is what is troubling to a lot of people and that\u2019s what makes this election, among other things, makes this election very different than others is that those good, decent people over -- at least overlooked a very, very sorry record of prejudice. DICKERSON: Let\u2019s switch to the Democratic Party and its challenges here in the last couple of minutes. Jamelle, what has the Democratic Party learned from this election and what does it do to fix itself? BOUIE: I think on a tactical level what the Democratic Party has learned is that it actually needs to win over some chunk or a greater chunk of working-class whites. I mean that ultimately is where this turned. Had Hillary Clinton won 60,000 more votes between Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin, she would be president of the United States. The question is, how you go about that. I think the choice, the likely choice of Keith Ellison as head of the DNC, Keith Ellison, congressman of Minnesota, African-American, Muslim-American, but also a member of the Democratic (INAUDIBLE) Labour Party in Minnesota, a strong populist, is giving you a sense of where the party may go in this direction. Kind of a commitment to its -- it\u2019s multiculturalism. A commitment to its social inclusion. But also a greater commitment to a kind of economic populace and that might be able to reach these voters. DICKERSON: Michael, what\u2019s your take on -- do they become the party of opposition? I remember Mitch McConnell saying that, you know, keeping Barack Obama to be a one-term president was his goal. Is that the better organizing principal, or have the Democrats really lost the theme and need to sell something positive? GERSON: Well, they don\u2019t have a lot of levers and they do need to wait for mistakes and wait for overreach, which often happens in new administrations. So I think they need to do this. But they do have a choice. They have a Sanders\u2019 model, a kind of left-wing economic populism. They have a Biden model, which is a much more outreach the white Catholics and union workers and a more traditional Democratic constituency. Or they have just someone who could actually implement the Obama model, the Obama coalition, which Hillary Clinton tried and could not get out the votes to do. But another candidate might be able to. This is the coalition of the ascended (ph). They\u2019re not yesterday ascended. They will eventually be ascended. I don\u2019t think that model is a discredited model. NOONAN: I just think it\u2019s amazing that one year ago and 18 amongst ago the subject at this table was the break-up of the Republican Party. It is shattering. It is breaking in two. It\u2019s lost everything. The -- GOLDBERG: Also last week it was the discussion, frankly, at this table. NOONAN: Fair enough. GOLDBERG: (INAUDIBLE) ago. NOONAN: And now it has turned and we\u2019re talking about the breakup of the Democratic Party. There\u2019s no deep bench. They can\u2019t win here. They can\u2019t do this. They\u2019ve lost here. The Obama coalition didn\u2019t turn out. Why working class doesn\u2019t like them. This is an amazing flip on expectations. DICKERSON: Although the Sanders campaign was evidence of all of that, it\u2019s just -- NOONAN: Well, yes. And part of the whole -- yes, but they didn\u2019t go down that road. GERSON: But, unfortunately -- DICKERSON: We have to go at this point, but, fortunately, we\u2019ve got lots to talk about in the future weeks and we\u2019ll look forward to having all of you here for that. But for the moment, we\u2019ve got to go. We\u2019ll be right back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: We\u2019re back now with the seven CBS News 2016 campaign embeds, the wonderful journalists who have covered every moment of this campaign. Sopan Deb covered Donald Trump. Hannah Fraser-Chanpong was with the Clinton campaign. Erica Brown followed Senator Tim Kaine, Chris Christie and John Kasich. Jacqueline Alemany was based in New Hampshire and then Ohio. Kylie Atwood was based in Iowa during the primaries and also covered Senator Bernie Sanders. Sean Gallitz was embedded with senator Marco Rubio and then covered the battleground state of North Carolina. And Alan He covered Governor Mike Pence and Jeb Bush. Erica, let me start with you, but I\u2019m going to ask all of you this question, which is, if there\u2019s a story from the road, was there a moment for you that sticks out? ERICA BROWN, CBS NEWS DIGITAL JOURNALIST: There was a moment, and it was a personal moment. It was in New Hampshire before the primary. There was a really bad snowstorm. And the snow was accumulating so quickly. And I was driving. And I got very nervous. And as I was turning the corner, it seemed in slow motion, my car started to veer into a ditch. And it got stuck. And there were five gentlemen riding in a tow truck who drove past me. They stopped, came back. They started digging out my car. And I immediately got out and I said, wait, I need to know how much this is going to cost me first before you guys continue because I don\u2019t know if we can afford this. And they said, you know, the cost is for you to do something nice for someone else. ALAN HE, CBS NEWS DIGITAL JOURNALIST: The thing that sticks out to me was on the last day of the campaign. It\u2019s 8:00 at night. We just landed in Manchester, New Hampshire. Mike Pence gets on the P.A. system on the airplane, and he thanks the staff, he thanks the Secret Service, he thanks the airplane crew, and then he goes ahead and thanks the reporters for telling the story of the vice presidential campaign. And then 20 minutes later, we\u2019re in this rally, this joint rally with Donald Trump and Mike Pence, and then Donald Trump comes on stage and calls us the most dishonest people. And it could not be a more jarring experience. DICKERSON: What did you -- what did you learn about this country, about who the voters are? Hannah, we\u2019ll start with you. HANNAH FRASER-CHANPONG, CBS NEWS DIGITAL JOURNALIST: I think most of the people who I met covering Hillary Clinton at her events were true believers. But there were moments on the campaign trail where she met voters who, you know, weren\u2019t going to support her or -- or who were not sure if they wanted to. When we went to West Virginia, she had a very memorable exchange with a man who worked in a coal mine, and he had lost his job. And I remember when we pulled up to that event, there were a lot of Trump supporters outside who were protesting. It was raining, but they were still out there. They were waiting for her and they were angry. And when we were inside, this man told her, you know, I represent those people outside. And I\u2019m not sure how you can come here and tell us that you\u2019re going to be our friend. And it was just a really telling moment that I think really held up in the end. DICKERSON: Sopan, and you were in some pretty rough stays (ph), you know, from time to time covering Donald Trump. SOPAN DEB, CBS NEWS DIGITAL JOURNALIST: What always struck me about Trump rallies was, they weren\u2019t rallies as much as they were concerts. You know, he\u2019d come on stage. You\u2019d be in these amphitheaters and (INAUDIBLE). And it doesn\u2019t matter what venue, he\u2019d always start out by saying, \u201cwow. Look at this crowd. It\u2019s record sending.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re -- you know, we were in a coffee shop or not, he said there are thousands of people outside waiting to get in. But in terms of the people, what always struck me was, there -- there almost was a -- they want -- you know, I felt like Trump supporters really wanted change, but a change back, not a change forward, which is kind of the, you know, make America great again, right? And so I always felt, you know, there was a fear of the change that was happening in the country already, and they wanted to change it back. KYLIE ATWOOD, CBS NEWS DIGITAL JOURNALIST: I think for me, as I -- as I talked to people at the different candidate events, it was clear that Americans take politics very personally. And I guess that was something that was new as a reporter who had covered politics more Washington centric politics, if you will. But talking to people was my favorite part of this job, because they have stories they want to tell you. SEAN GALLITZ, CBS NEWS DIGITAL JOURNALIST: I mean I think we all know this has been a pretty divisive election. I had a week where I covered like a Bernie Sanders event on Wednesday, Ted Cruz on Thursday, Bill Clinton on Friday, back to back, and like what I\u2019ll never forget, especially coming like a Sanders campaign rally and a Ted Cruz rally, they weren\u2019t talking to the same country I felt like. There was -- there was no commonality in their messaging or what they were talking about. They were painting very different pictures, and I think we\u2019re seeing some of the -- some of the aftereffects of that in some ways. DICKERSON: So, Alan, you were with Governor Pence when the video comes out about Donald Trump on the bus with Billy Bush and those remarks. What was it like in those moments of -- I mean what happens to a campaign in a low moment and how did the candidates respond? HE: For the reporters covering the campaign, it felt like the campaign was in a death throw (ph). But, you know, we -- that day we went up to the rope line, which you\u2019re not supposed to do, and we asked Mike Pence, you know, what\u2019s your reaction? What\u2019s your reaction? And he didn\u2019t respond. And then he just walked away. DICKERSON: And, Hannah, what was it like on the -- when the -- when the Comey letter came out? FRASER-CHANPONG: Yes. We were on the campaign plane flying to Cedar Rapids the day that James Comey sent his letter to The Hill saying he was looking at something new. And we had no wi-fi on the plane. And then suddenly a reporter, who somehow got a tweet or something came up on his phone and he was like, um, you know, have you seen this? And, you know, all the campaign sort of disappear and -- into their cabin and consult about it. And when we landed, it was sort of unclear whether or not, you know, the candidate knew that this was happening. But the day sort of carried on like it was a completely normal day. We went to the event. Hillary Clinton did the event. She didn\u2019t mention it at all. And then, by the end of the day, they decided to respond, and they responded pretty forcefully to -- to Comey and -- and she had a little press conference and, you know, where she\u2019s followed by press calls and press releases and all this, but it was -- it was a really, sort of weird day. JACQUELINE ALEMANY, CBS NEWS DIGITAL JOURNALIST: Then you have the low moments, though. What was amazing to me amongst Trump supporters was that there were never any low moments despite the media narrative. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, that\u2019s right. ALEMANY: I went to a -- the watch -- a watch party in Parma for -- hosted by a group of Trump supporters after the lewd tape had come out, the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. And people were cheering and hooting and hollering the entire time and walked away, you know, that Donald Trump blew -- blew us away. He won hands down. That was it. You know, it was a completely different narrative. And I don\u2019t think Trump supporters lost faith once throughout this whole thing. DEB: No. No. And the most shocking moment for me on the campaign trail was before a debate, I was, along with a small -- the pool -- the pool reporters, we were going we were going to get -- you\u2019re going to get a five-minute photo op with Trump preparing for the debate. And then we walk in and -- and my jaw just drops. It\u2019s Trump -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There\u2019s a picture of it. I\u2019ve seen that picture in your face. DEB: It\u2019s trump with -- with Clinton accusers of sexual -- alleged sexual misconduct. And you see -- I\u2019m on the live stream. Donald Trump is live streaming the reaction of the reporters as they\u2019re walking in. You could see me and you could see me kind of walk in and go. It was truly one of the most shocking moments of the campaign or probably that I\u2019ve ever seen. DICKERSON: We\u2019ll talk more about campaign 2016 with our panel after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: With our campaign reporters talking about surprising moments on the campaign trail. BROWN: I think the moment I got to play ski ball with Ben Carson was surprising. DICKERSON: And how is he as a ski ballplayer? BROWN: I beat him by 3,000 points. DICKERSON: Is that a lot or a little in ski ball? BROWN: That\u2019s in between. Medium. Because Dr. Carson wasn\u2019t the most accessible in terms of getting beneath the surface. He would hold gaggles often, but we never quite knew what it would be like around him off of the campaign trail just to kind of get a sense of how he was as a person. DEB: To Erica\u2019s point, when I first started this job, I pictured this similar reactions from candidates. I never got to know Donald Trump. I covered him since pretty much the beginning of his candidacy. A lot of his surrogates talk about it. There\u2019s this Donald Trump, there\u2019s this private Donald Trump, this charming, disarming guy that is not the combative person they see at rallies and in interviews. I only saw the combative person because he never -- he never gave us any access. He never talked to us. He never -- you know, I\u2019d be surprised if he knew the names of anybody in his traveling press. DICKERSON: Why would anybody want to be an imbed? BROWN: Oh, my gosh. Being an inbed grows you tremendously as a journalist. You get to interact with so many voters and learn about what makes this country unique, what makes people want to come here and what some of the -- some of the concerns are with people who lived here and who have families here and who want to be constructive members of society. DEB: On top of learning about America and the people, being away from friends and family for a year and a half, you also learn a lot about yourself. GALLITZ: This is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done physically, emotionally, psychologically. I mean, this job tests you in ways you didn\u2019t think were possible. And you learn, like Sopan said, a lot about yourself and what you\u2019re actually capable of, whether you think you can stay awake for 36 straight hours and, you know, travel the way we did and everything else. But there\u2019s also the hotel points and -- BROWN: And airline miles. GALLITZ: All of that kind of stuff, which is not a bad perk, so -- DICKERSON: The Courtyard Marriott. GALLITZ: Yes. I mean -- DEB: I was wondering who would say that. GALLITZ: Yes. (CROSS TALK) ATWOOD: I mean, they\u2019ve all said it. I think it\u2019s -- you are on the front lines of history in the most -- in the most beautiful way. I mean you see it. You eat it. You live it. You breathe it. I mean, I -- I never thought that I would have such an understanding of like the fabric of America. DICKERSON: Well, as someone who read all of your work and profited from it and also somebody who once did what you do, I couldn\u2019t have done it half as well as you all did, and we are incredibly grateful for your energy, for what you taught us and for that fact that you reminded us that there is joy in covering these races and in this incredible American experience that is an election. There was not a lot of joy at times in this campaign, and so thanks for bringing some of it back into our lives. GALLITZ: Thanks. ATWOOD: Thank you. ALEMANY: Thank you. DICKERSON: And we\u2019ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: We want to say congratulations and thank you today to veteran CBS News correspondent Bill Plante. Bill\u2019s career has taken him all over the world, to unprecedented heights and into the most powerful rooms in Washington. As a young reporter, he covered the civil rights movement, interviewing Martin Luther King during the historic march from Selma to Montgomery. And he covered every president from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Bill Plante? No? Bill\u2019s not here? That\u2019s shocking. (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: Bill, it\u2019s hard for us to imagine CBS News without you. No one does it better, and you\u2019ll be missed. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I\u2019m John Dickerson.",

President-elect Trump and vice president-elect Pence hunkered down this weekend to interview candidates for top positions in their new administration.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: We\u2019re seeing tremendous talent, people that, as I say, we will make America great again.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: But will they? Not everyone is so sure. Friday night, Mr. Pence received an unexpected message while attending a performance of the musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We, sir, we are a diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: We will talk to vice president-elect Pence about that and get an update on Mr. Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks.  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is threatening to block some potential nominees, and we will ask him why.  We will also hear from Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison, one Democrat trying to reshape his party.  And what are the policy challenges ahead for Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress? We have assembled a panel of experts to explore.  Plus, we will honor our friend, the legendary journalist Gwen Ifill.  It\u2019s all ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson. President-elect Trump met yesterday with former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a possible candidate for the job of secretary of state. The two appear to have moved past Romney\u2019s tough criticism during the campaign.  Mr. Trump also met with former CENTCOM Commander James Mattis, who is a candidate for the job of secretary of defense.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: All I can say is, he is the real deal. He is the real deal.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: We\u2019re joined now by the head of the transition team and vice president-elect Mike Pence.  Mr. Vice President-Elect, I want to start. Are there going to be any announcements today on staffing?  MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: I think that\u2019s yet to be seen, John.  And good to be with you this morning. We\u2019re here at Trump National after a brisk day yesterday.  But I have to tell you, to be able to have the opportunity to help lead this transition effort, to be sitting shoulder to shoulder with our president-elect as he\u2019s talking to men and women of extraordinary backgrounds and capabilities, putting this administration together, building the agenda, being there when he\u2019s talking to leaders around the world, has been deeply inspiring.  And I think every American would be inspired by the leadership that our president-elect has shown from literally hours after this election was called.  DICKERSON: And Mitt Romney as a possible secretary of state, is that right?  PENCE: That\u2019s absolutely right, John.  And I know the president-elect was very grateful that Governor Mitt Romney came here to New Jersey yesterday. We spent the better part of an hour together with him. And then I know that the two of them actually had some private time together.  I would tell you that it was not only a cordial meeting, but also it was a very substantive meeting. And I can say that Governor Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the United States.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about some work you have done in the transition since taking it over. You have moved out some lobbyists. And, in keeping with that, Donald Trump told me a couple months ago that he would have no problem with having no lobbyists and no major donors in his administration at all. Do you think he will be able to keep that promise?  PENCE: Well, I think the American people want to see change in Washington, D.C., that there\u2019s been heartbreak and disappointment when it\u2019s over recent years and frankly successive administrations where we have seen -- see an inability for Washington, D.C., to get anything done.  And the president-elect is absolutely determined to build an administration with women and men who bring that fresh perspective and a determination on doing the people\u2019s business and not the business of special interests.  And so, as you know, we made changes as soon as I took over the transition effort. We made changes. We moved lobbyists out of the transition team, and that\u2019s going to continue to be a lodestar.  And I can tell your viewers that the president-elect is determined to move ethics reform in the next year in the Congress of the United States. A lot of people around the country want to see us drain the swamp. They want to see fundamental ethics reform. That\u2019s going to happen starting January the 20th.  DICKERSON: So, just to button that up, so no lobbyists or donors in the administration, as he promised, that\u2019s right?  PENCE: Well, I think what the president-elect has made clear is that we\u2019re going to have people in the administration who are 100 percent focused on serving the American people and moving the Trump agenda forward.  And to sit with him in these interviews that have been taking place over the last week, to sit with him with congressional leaders, as the two of us did a week ago, is to see someone who is completely focused on keeping the promises that he made to the American people.  And I got to tell you, it\u2019s really been inspiring to be standing shoulder to shoulder with our president-elect, even in these few short days since that historic election.  DICKERSON: But that doesn\u2019t quite sound like a yes to me. So it seems like there\u2019s some wiggle room on the no lobbyists and donors, so we will look for some clarity on that to come.  But let me ask you about this question. \u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u201d has asked that Mr. Trump liquidate his holdings with his business. Will he?  PENCE: Well, I saw that editorial.  And what I can tell you is that I\u2019m very confident that the president-elect and his extraordinarily talented family are going to work with the best legal minds in this country and create the proper separation from their business enterprise during his duties as president of the United States.  DICKERSON: Should people...  PENCE: To be around him is to be around man who is completely focused on the people\u2019s business. And to get to know his children is to get to know men and women of extraordinary capability who I know he\u2019s confident they can lead the business enterprise while he puts all of his energies, all of his focus in the people\u2019s business.  DICKERSON: Should employees of the Trump businesses be involved at all in the people\u2019s business, in government business, meetings?  PENCE: Well, I think, during this transition, it is very helpful...  DICKERSON: How about during the presidency?  PENCE: ... for the president-elect to -- well, I think, during the presidency, there will be the proper separation.  I can just assure all of your viewers that to be around president-elect Donald Trump now is to be around someone who, while he has built literally one of the most prosperous businesses in the country, he\u2019s a man who is spending all of his energies and all of his focus on that agenda that he campaigned on.  And it\u2019s about bringing personnel together. We will have more extraordinary men and women here in New Jersey today who are under consideration for positions of enormous import. But it\u2019s also about laying out the policies that we\u2019re going to start on day one in this Congress to implement.  And the president-elect has already made the decision in conversations with Republican leaders in the House and Senate that we\u2019re going to lift the extraordinary burden of Obamacare off the backs of the American people and off the backs of American businesses. Repealing Obamacare will be the first priority in a session that will be characterized by tax reform, rebuilding the military, infrastructure, ending illegal immigration, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: Here\u2019s the question for a candidate who worked so hard and made such a strong point about draining the swamp, about the Washington culture of self-dealing. You would expect brighter lines in terms of the private business and the presidency.  If a foreign country, for example, does business with the Trump industries, would we expect to see that notified -- with the notification of that? Because you could imagine somebody trying to do business with the Trump family as a way of getting in good with the Trump president.  PENCE: John, what I can assure you and all of your viewers is that all of the laws pertaining to his business dealings and his service as president of the United States will be strictly adhered to.  And he\u2019s set that tone from the very beginning. But the other part is just, you know, I\u2019m very confident that we will operate an administration that is above reproach with regard to all of those issues.  One of the reasons why I believe Donald Trump won a mandate for leadership is because he wasn\u2019t a career politician. He spent an entire lifetime as a builder, creating jobs, building a business enterprise. And the American people said yes to bringing a builder and a business leader into the White House.  We will create the proper legal separation, above reproach, as he goes forward. And I promise you, president-elect Donald Trump is today and president Donald Trump, after January 20, is going to be completely focused on the people\u2019s business and he will leave his business life in the past.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you a policy question.  Senator John McCain is worried about water-boarding. The Kansas Congressman Mike Pompeo who is going to be going to the CIA supports Mr. Trump\u2019s position that perhaps water-boarding should come back.  Let\u2019s listen to what Senator McCain said.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I don\u2019t give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do. We will not water-board. We will not torture.  (APPLAUSE)  MCCAIN: My God, what does it say about America if we\u2019re going to inflict torture on people?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: What\u2019s your response to that?  PENCE: Well, I have great respect for Senator McCain.  And what I can tell you is, in going forward, as he outlined in that famous speech in Ohio, that a President Donald Trump is going to focus on confronting and defeating radical Islamic terrorism as a threat to this country.  And we\u2019re going to have a president again who will never say what we will never do. I think, in president-elect Donald Trump, you have someone who believes that we shouldn\u2019t be telling the enemy what our tactics or our strategies are.  And I know that, in conversations with some leading Americans about playing roles in our administration, we\u2019re very excited about Congressman Pompeo\u2019s role at the CIA. We\u2019re very excited to see General Mike Flynn stepping into his leadership position.  The team that we assemble, the president-elect assembles at the Department of Defense will all advise him, but the American people should know this is a president who, on day one, January 20, is going to focus on defeating and destroying ISIS at its source and confronting radical Islamic terrorism, so it can no longer threaten our people or inspire violence here in the homeland.  DICKERSON: At the moment, though, water-boarding is something the United States government does not do, so the enemy already knows that water-boarding is not something the United States does.  Is it going to be reassessed by the Trump administration?  PENCE: Well, I think the president-elect made his views on that quite clear during the course of the campaign.  And -- but, as we go forward, what I can tell you is, it\u2019s not going to be about a specific tactic. What I see in these meetings with the president-elect and candidates for our national security and our national defense is someone who is determined to surround himself with men and women of extraordinary background and capability.  We have got real challenges around the world today, John, and the American people should know that president-elect Donald Trump is going to surround himself with men and women who are going to ensure our national defense. We\u2019re going to rebuild our military.  But this is going to be a president that is going to be determined to destroy ISIS and to confront radical Islamic terrorism, so it can no longer threaten our people here at home.  DICKERSON: Finally, Mr. Vice President-Elect, you went to see \u201cHamilton.\u201d The actors sent a message to you at the end of the show.  And part of it was, \u201cWe are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your administration will not protect us.\u201d  Why do you think they\u2019re alarmed and anxious?  PENCE: Well, first off, we -- I took my daughter and her cousins to the show Fridaynight.  And John, if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, it\u2019s a great show. I\u2019m a history buff, and my hat\u2019s off to the cast and to the extraordinary team that brought \u201cHamilton\u201d to the public. We really enjoyed being there.  And, yes, I heard the remarks that were made at the end. And, you know, what I can tell you is, I wasn\u2019t offended by what was said. I will leave to others whether it was the appropriate venue to say it.  But I want to assure people who were disappointed in the election result, people who are feeling anxious about this time in the life of our nation that president-elect Donald Trump meant exactly what he said on election night, that he is going to be the president of all the people of the United States of America.  And to see this man who is bringing this energy and this leadership to the process of assembling this team and laying out an agenda to revive our country and strengthen America at home and abroad is to see someone who is not only a great mind, but a great heart. He\u2019s got heart for the American people.  And I just -- I just want to reassure anyone, anyone, including the actor who spoke that night, that president-elect Donald Trump is going to be president of all the people. And I couldn\u2019t be more honored to stand with him.  DICKERSON: Vice president-elect Mike Pence, we will leave it there.  And we will be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We turn now to Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.  Senator, welcome back.  Let\u2019s start with the Trump Cabinet or possible Trump Cabinet picks. You have said that you would block maybe Rudy Giuliani or John Bolton if they were put forward for positions in the Trump administration. Why?  SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: I mean, I supported Donald Trump. And one of the reasons I did was that I liked what he had to say about the Iraq War was a mistake. I think that\u2019s an important historical lesson.  It\u2019s not a matter of when he said it or who he said it to. It\u2019s of matter of he understands that the Iraq War was a mistake and regime change was a mistake.  So, I think it would be inconsistent with his campaign theme. I want people that run the State Department who agree with Donald Trump. That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to help. I\u2019m trying to be helpful here.  And the problem with both Bolton and Giuliani is, they\u2019re unrepentant in their support of the Iraq War. They haven\u2019t learned any of the lessons. And if we don\u2019t learn the lesson of the Iraq War. we\u2019re liable to commit it again.  This is something Hillary Clinton never understood. She said she voted for the Iraq War, but then she thought she was wrong, but then she did the same thing in Libya, the same thing in Syria. And I think regime change in the Middle East hasn\u2019t worked.  And so I think it\u2019s important that we get a -- someone at the head of the State Department that understands what Donald Trump said over and over again, the Iraq War was a mistake.  DICKERSON: Would you include Mitt Romney, who vice president- elect Mike Pence said is under consideration, in that same basket?  PAUL: I\u2019m not sure I would call him unrepentant. I would say that he is somebody who has supported the Iraq War. And I would want to hear more. I think we should ask.  No matter what the stature of the person, we should ask, what are your beliefs? Was the Iraq War a mistake? Are you for regime change? Do you think that toppling Assad in Syria will lead to a better world or a safer world? Do you think toppling Gadhafi in Libya did? Do you think toppling Mubarak? All of these questions should be asked. And they\u2019re important questions. And I will ask that.  As far as reasonability, if I were to rank Romney up there with someone who I think is a reasonable, even keel, vs. a Giuliani or a Bolton, I think Giuliani and Bolton are out there on the extreme. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re very diplomatic. And I think you want the chief diplomat to be diplomatic.  And I have said before Bolton might be better as a secretary of war, but he\u2019s certainly not a diplomat or someone who acts in a diplomatic way or thinks that diplomacy might be an alternative to war.  DICKERSON: You have any of your own candidates you would put forward?  (LAUGHTER)  PAUL: I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t get to pick. I wish I got to pick.  But they have said in the mix, Bob Corker was in the mix. And I also find him to be very reasonable, very knowledgeable with foreign affairs. As head of the Foreign Relations Committee, I think he\u2019s interacted with many of our foreign leaders. And I think that\u2019s what you want, is a reasonable, calming hand at the State Department.  You don\u2019t want someone throwing bombs or advocating regime change. I mean, both Bolton and Giuliani have advocated for regime change in Iran, and that doesn\u2019t sound like diplomacy. That sounds like war.  DICKERSON: Right.  Have you been contacted by anybody in the Trump orbit to say -- to at least address your concerns, or...  PAUL: Well, we have. We have had conversations with them, nothing public or nothing I care to make public. But we have had conversations expressing -- you know, it\u2019s a very close vote.  There\u2019s 52 Republicans. Some of the people that have been put forward, I think, are not guaranteed to get any Democrat support, so they lose my support and a couple of other Republicans -- many Republicans have come up to me and said, you know what, Bolton is kind of a bomb-thrower. He\u2019s not really sort of this even keel with a world view that we want over there. We want someone a little more rational or reasonable.  And so I think that there are several potential Republican votes against someone like a Bolton, possibly Giuliani. The other thing Giuliani is going to stir up is, it is going to be a hornets nest on all the financial stuff.  DICKERSON: What did you make of vice president-elect Pence\u2019s remarks about water-boarding and torture? It seems like that\u2019s now open for discussion again.  PAUL: Well, you know, the Bush administration said we weren\u2019t going to do it. The Obama administration said we weren\u2019t going to do it. The international community condemns it. I think it is torture.  And while John McCain and I don\u2019t always agree on everything, we have our disagreements a few times, but, on this, I absolutely think John McCain is right. We shouldn\u2019t torture.  And instead of sort of holding this to ourselves and saying -- being ambiguous about it, we should telegraph to the world that we\u2019re better than this and we don\u2019t torture, and this is why we are exceptional as a people. We don\u2019t torture our -- any prisoners.  DICKERSON: You have also been a vocal critic of what the government does to look into its citizens\u2019 business, whether it\u2019s bulk collection of data or wiretapping.  What, given that mind-set, is your view about the elevation of Jeff Sessions to attorney general and Mike Pompeo into the CIA?  PAUL: You know, I am a fierce advocate of privacy and think that you do have a right to privacy and that your records, whether they\u2019re in the possession of the phone company or not, that you still retain a right of privacy in those records.  We all sign privacy agreements every time we do a computer search with a computer search company or with a telephone company. So, I think we do have a right the privacy.  I\u2019m hopeful, but I also know that this president doesn\u2019t necessarily agree with me on -- the next president. And so we will see. I will continue to be an equal opportunity defender of the Bill of Rights, whether it\u2019s a Republican or Democrat president.  DICKERSON: But you don\u2019t -- do you have any specific concerns with respect to Sessions or Pompeo? They both supported the Patriot Act, bulk collection of metadata.  PAUL: Right. It does concern me, yes.  But I would say that, with Pompeo, he\u2019s going to have to also answer, to my liking, whether or not he\u2019s still for torture, whether or not he\u2019s for water-boarding. That\u2019s important.  He\u2019s also been for expanding NSA powers. Many of the NSA powers were done, I think, in secret without the knowledge of most members of Congress. Even some members who were authors or co-authors of the Patriot Act said, we never intended for them to collect all that data in Utah, and they didn\u2019t tell us.  So, one of my questions for Pompeo will be, are there secret programs that even Congress doesn\u2019t know about? And I think there still are programs ongoing that the bulk of Congress is not aware of.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you, what do you think the Senate\u2019s oversight role is with respect to Donald Trump and then the Trump businesses?  PAUL: You know, I think that he probably will have every legal right to not put things in a blind trust, but it may continue to come up if there is an appearance that a certain country has a Trump hotel and that there\u2019s more visits to that particular country or Trump hotel. Will that be a problem?  Yes, I think he will get dogged about it. So, probably, it\u2019s legal for him not to completely separate, but my advice, if I were asked, would be try to do the best you can to separate, so you don\u2019t have this. It will deter you from things you want to get done if everybody keeps asking you about, what about the Trump hotel you visited?  DICKERSON: Well, it does seem to me we just had a big campaign in which the fuzzy line between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department was a crucial sign of her weakness as president. So, why would a president wanting to drain the swamp come in and not have the lines be bright and clear for all to see?  PAUL: This will be the same with Giuliani and his international interests and financial dealings around the world.  So, yes, I think it\u2019s best to clean this out. And if you just spent a year-and-a-half criticizing Clinton for taking money from foreign countries, you better be very careful about appointing somebody who has taken a lot of money from foreign countries as well.  DICKERSON: Donald Trump talked about a Ford plant in Kentucky this week. Did he do anything to help keep that Ford plant in Kentucky?  PAUL: Maybe.  And I think that people misconstrue this. They said, oh, the jobs were never leaving. Well, an assembly line was leaving, so maybe the potential of jobs was leaving. Something was going.  And I think there is some value to the bully pulpit. People say, well, how is he going to do this? Well, you know what? Maybe talking a tough line on trade and that, you know, there will be repercussions if you leave the country, maybe it did change their mind. I don\u2019t know.  But I\u2019m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and give him a little credit for it, simply because it\u2019s my state and we\u2019re happy that an assembly of a certain vehicle is not going to Mexico. Whether the jobs were going or not, I think something was going to Mexico, and now it\u2019s not. Sounds good to me.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator Rand Paul, we appreciate having you here. We will look forward to having you back.  And we will be back in a moment with a tribute to our friend Gwen Ifill.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: The nation lost a great journalist when \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d co-anchor and \u201cWashington Week\u201d host Gwen Ifill passed away this week.  But here at FACE THE NATION, we lost a dear friend.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GWEN IFILL, CO-ANCHOR, \u201cPBS NEWSHOUR\u201d: This is not a debate right now about ideology.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Over the years, Gwen brought her insights, her love of reporting and her ability to puncture to our roundtable.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  IFILL: It must make her crazy to have David Axelrod be her defender, because he\u2019s the one who fought to take her down in 2008.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: She also joined in the questioning from time to time.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  IFILL: Last I checked, Congressman Gonzalez and Senator Riegle have not swayed in their decision not to have -- pursue this kind of an inquiry. So, what is the point in continuing to discuss it?  BOB DOLE, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think there\u2019s a big point.  IFILL: To keep it alive?  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Quakers say let your light shine, and Gwen\u2019s inner light beamed with her smile. The tributes to her used so many words to describe that smile, that the source was empty.  She chose joy, her friend the journalist Michele Norris said at her funeral yesterday. It was a conscious project. She sent notes to see how you were doing, checked in on journalists she had mentored, and devoted herself to her church, her family and her friends.  Gwen Ifill wore grace like a garment. And you felt it. The effect was visible to others.  A colleague wrote me this week, \u201cYou always looked happy and inspired on her show.\u201d  When you were around Gwen, you couldn\u2019t help it.  Gwen Ifill was 61.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Some of our CBS stations are leaving us now, but, for most of you, we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including an interview with one of the leading candidates to head the Democratic Party.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back the FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  While Republicans are busy preparing for a Trump administration, Democrats are doing some soul-searching.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: When you lose the White House to the least popular candidate in the history of America, when you lose the Senate, when you lose the House, and when two-thirds of governors in this country are Republicans, it is time for a new direction for the Democratic Party.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: One of those auditioning for the job as the new head of the Democratic Party is Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison. He joins us from Minneapolis.  Congressman, what should the new direction for the Democratic Party be?  REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), MINNESOTA: Well, we\u2019ve got to strengthen the grassroots. You know, we got 3,141 counties in many, many cities across this country where Democrats are thriving and working every day. The power needs to be in their hands. We need the make sure the resources are with them and everything else.  We need the prioritize voter turnout. And that doesn\u2019t mean get out the vote at the end of the election. That means 365 day a year engagement relationship building with voters around what their priorities are.  We got to make sure that the Democratic Party is not just Democratic, but seen to be Democratic. That means we got to have systems in place that makes sure that everybody who participates in a primary is perceived to have an equal shot with everybody else. And we out to make sure that --  DICKERSON: It\u2019s --  ELLISON: Yes?  DICKERSON: Well, no, continue your list.  ELLISON: Well, I mean, there\u2019s a -- and we\u2019ve got to also create more collaboration. I mean we have Democrats who hold office in secretaries of state. We -- and those folks run the election. We need the stand up for them. City officials, college Dems, organized labor needs to have a whole lot more say so and a lot more respect in the Democratic Party. We\u2019ve got to make sure our veteran, Democratic veterans are strengthened and feel like they are fully included. We have got to just make sure that the -- the -- the Democratic rank and file really owns the party and feels that it is theirs, that it is fair, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do.  DICKERSON: The reason I wanted you to finish your list is I noticed Donald Trump wasn\u2019t in it. There are a lot of Democrats who are organizing, planning, and -- and setting themselves up as an opposition party to Donald Trump and using that as an organizing principle. That wasn\u2019t in your -- your list. How should Democrats think about Donald Trump? One hundred percent opposed, work with him?  ELLISON: Well, Donald Trump is already proven where he\u2019s going with the thing. I mean there was a political article that -- entitled, \u201cwhy Wall Street is suddenly in love with Donald Trump.\u201d He\u2019s not draining the swamp. He\u2019s filling it up more. And there\u2019s going to be more swamp creatures than ever before. I mean he is -- lobbyists and big-time investment bankers, he\u2019s not -- he\u2019s not doing what he said he was going to do for average working Americans. And we have got to be there to work with all those folks who may have not voted or even voted for him. They are our natural constituents. But we\u2019ve got to show them that we really care about them, that we respected their voice, and that we are going to be fighting for them tooth and nail.  But I would say to Democrats, we -- we should not make Donald Trump the focal point of all of our energy. We need to make the people, the average worker (ph) day American, who -- who we are fighting for and make that crystal clear every single day. The reason we did --  DICKERSON: Well --  ELLISON: Yes?  DICKERSON: Let me ask you, congressman, one of the argument some Democrats make is that Democrats should not normalize. It\u2019s a buzz word you hear constantly. Donald Trump, not treat him as a normal president. What\u2019s your advice to Democrats about that?  ELLISON: Well, we should be authentic. And he\u2019s clearly not normal. He ran on -- he talked about jobs and yet he has hurt workers all over this country; in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and even in Florida. He has undermined workers. He\u2019s hurt small business people and not paid contractors. Yes, it\u2019s a -- his level of abuse of working people is extraordinary. And not to mention his racism, misogyny extraordinary, as well. It\u2019s hard to normalize that. and we can never do it.  But I would just say that it\u2019s not about Donald Trump. We are going to -- we are going to end -- we\u2019re going to fight him because he stands against our value system. But if we make the average American\u2019s needs our priority, people who want to retire, people who want to see their kids go to college, people who want to earn a decent living, people anxious about the plant closing down, moving to another country and selling them back the products that they used to make. If we make those people the priority, we will win and Donald Trump will be relegated to be a footnote in the dustbin of history. That is what we got to do, focus on our people.  DICKERSON: All right. All right, congressmen, thanks so much for being with us.  And we\u2019ll be right back with our panel.  ELLISON: Any time. Thank you.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BECK BENNETT, PORTRAYING MIKE PENCE, \u201cSATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\u201d: We have a few problems. The Democrats are already pushing back on our illegal immigration act because they say finding 11 million illegal immigrants is going to be hard.  ALEC BALDWIN, PORTRAYING DONALD TRUMP, \u201cSATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\u201d: Impossible probably.  BENNETT: And then they say it\u2019s going to be even harder to deport them.  BALDWIN: So maybe let\u2019s not do it.  BENNETT: Uh, don\u2019t do it?  BALDWIN: Yes. Scrap it.  BENNETT: Scrap it?  BALDWIN: Scrapped. Scrapped.  BENNETT: OK, you know what, maybe -- maybe we\u2019ll just talk about that later. Let\u2019s move on to Obamacare. As you know, 20 million people use it. And it sounds crazy, but a lot of them like it.  BALDWIN: Keep it. Let\u2019s just keep it.  BENNETT: I\u2019m sorry, keep it?  BALDWIN: Yes, keep it. All of it. No change.  BENNETT: OK. You know, let\u2019s just hold that for later, all right.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d made light of the policy changes ahead for the new Trump administration, but in all seriousness, whether the president-elect will stick with his campaign promises and, if so, can they be enacted, are big questions.  So we\u2019ve assembled a panel of experts who have mostly conservative leanings to help us understand just how enormous some of those challenges are. Lanhee Chen served as policy director for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. He is also a CNN political commentator and a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Grover Norquist is president of the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform. Maya MacGuineas is president of the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And David Frum is a senior editor at \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d and a former speechwriter for George W. Bush.  DICKERSON: David, I want to start with you.  On this question of conflicts -- potential conflicts, relationship between Donald Trump, the president, and -- and the Trump business. What do you make of their initial responses about how that will be handled?  DAVID FRUM, \u201cTHE ATLANTIC\u201d: Not good. I think the very first order of businesses, the very first order of business for Republicans who want to insure a successful administration, is to corruption-proof the administration. It\u2019s going to be a big problem. And the surest way to do that is to passes a law formalizing the long tradition that the president must publish his tax returns. It may or may not be possible. The president may or may not be willing to divest himself. But the way for the public to be protected is for people to know what the president has, whether he receives any benefit. Because of the particular nature of Donald Trump\u2019s businesses, everything that happens at the Trump Organization flows into his tax return. So if we can see the tax return, we can know, is anyone trying to bribe him? Has anyone succeeded?  DICKERSON: Grover, Donald Trump campaigned on draining the swamp. He campaigned on getting rid of the self-dealing in Washington. It was not a small issue. So, when Mike Pence was kind of vague, he said, trust me, it will all get worked out, wouldn\u2019t you expect kind of brighter lines from a candidate who spent so much time talking about changing Washington?  GROVER NORQUIST, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM: Yes, and, look, you want to change all of Washington. The focus on Trump is -- is interesting, but there\u2019s a House, there\u2019s a Senate, there are governors, there\u2019s an entire bureaucracy. We need to reduce the amount of money the federal government spends. If you don\u2019t want people stealing some of it, the best way to do that is to have less of it spent.  Very important that the Republicans maintain their ban on earmarks. That -- earmarks have been the currency of corruption in Washington, D.C., for years and years and years. The Republicans ended that. Some people want to bring it back. We should make sure, one, we stop that, and, two, instead of having money for roads come to Washington, D.C., where we then send it back out with a series of regulations and strings on it, including the Davis-Bacon Act, which was a racist act passed in the 1930s to keep African-Americans from competing in those jobs, it should be repealed simply because it\u2019s racist, but it also raises the cost of building anything in the United States that the federal government touches by 25 percent to 33 percent. We should, one, get rid of the Davis-Bacon Act. West Virginia just got rid of their version of the Davis-Bacon Act. Wisconsin did.  DICKERSON: Yes.  NORQUIST: A number of states have abolished that. We should at the federal level. And we should let states raise their own money and build their own roads. You bring trillions into the United -- into Washington, D.C., to spend.  DICKERSON: Lanhee --  NORQUIST: It will corrupt thing.  DICKERSON: Lanhee, Grover just had a nice detailed list there of things that need to be done, so that\u2019s one area. But -- but, still, back to the president, who is no small actor in politics in Washington. What could he do? What -- what -- other than what David suggested, which is publishing those tax returns, what else might you expect from a president who ran so forcefully on the idea of changing the way Washington works in terms of his own relationships?  LANHEE CHEN, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, I think certainly he should hold himself to a higher standard. And if there are concerns, particularly about what\u2019s happening within the dealings in his family business, he should think about ways to put up more vigorous firewalls, frankly, between what his family is doing with the business and what he might be doing with the people\u2019s business as president. So I think it\u2019s important for him to think about that.  I think this issue of lobbyists also is important. I think that the administration, or the -- the president-elect\u2019s administration, kind of turning around and saying, look, we are going to make a serious effort to ensure that there isn\u2019t the kind of revolving door that we may have seen in previous administrations by putting in place, for example, this five-year ban. I think that\u2019s a great idea. Remember, the essence of the Trump candidacy is as the outsider. And it\u2019s crucially important for his credibility, but also the credibility of Republicans who were elected with him, for him to behave in a way that is completely above reproach.  DICKERSON: All right, let me ask you now, switching and going back to Grover\u2019s point a little bit, the budget. So we have promises that were made on the campaign trail, and then we have the reality of the budget. Where should people trying to figure out where the rubber meets the road, what should they look to?  MAYA MACGUINEAS, COMMITTEE FOR A RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL BUDGET: Right. So, first, for starters, President-elect Trump is going to be inheriting the worst fiscal situation of any president as judged by the debt relative to the economy, other than President Truman, when he\u2019s walking into office. So he\u2019s got a tough starting point.  He spent a lot of time on the campaign talking about the importance of getting that trillion -- $20 trillion debt back down and yet we looked at the proposals that he put forth during the campaign. They would, in fact, add over $5 trillion to the national debt, and that\u2019s on top of borrowing $9 trillion that we are poised to do if we do nothing. So he has a huge challenge ahead of him.  He\u2019s also going to be working with the Republican Congress that for years has said it\u2019s very important to balance the budget over a ten-year period. The question is, now that they have the House, the Senate and the White House, are they suddenly going to pull back from those fiscal goals because he has these unpaid-for-tax cuts, infrastructure spending, increases in defense, lots of things that would actually balloon the debt, or are they going to hold to those fiscal goals, which are very important for both getting the debt under control and actually helping to grow the economy, which is the other major goal.  CHEN: You know, John, I think the flipside of that also is, Donald Trump, during the campaign, did not say very much about Medicare or Social Security. Now, remember, the three biggest drivers of federal deficit and debt going forward are health care spending, Social Security and net interest on the debt. So unless we do something about those quickly, this is a problem like compounding interest is a good thing when you invest, this is the opposite of that. And so it is crucially important.  And I\u2019m glad to see, by the way, that Republicans have begun to focus on Medicare reform, because that is the -- the more intractable, I think, of the two problems between Medicare and Social Security. But it\u2019s also important for him, I think, to revisit what he said during the campaign, which is that he didn\u2019t want to touch Social Security.  MACGUINEAS: That\u2019s right.  CHEN: I think it\u2019s important that we look at things like the retirement age and also the growth of benefits.  FRUM: But -- but there\u2019s something kind of surreal about this because we are in a city now that has had, for a long time, a two- party system. It\u2019s now a three party system. There\u2019s a Republican Party, the Democratic Party and a Trump party. And the Republican Party has priorities, and Lanhee, the eminent expert on -- on what -- what those are and should be and they\u2019re -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re right and important. But the president also has his own priorities. And they are summed up with that photograph of him with those dubious Indian businessmen giving the thumbs-up sign that was tweeted out. And what is going to be very important is for the Republican Party to accomplish its goals, it must prevent the Trump party from accomplishing its goals, which are of a very different and much dirtier order.  NORQUIST: You can start where there\u2019s tremendous agreement. The tax proposal that Trump has put forward is very similar to the one that\u2019s been put forward by the House Republicans, Brady, and the Ways and Means Committee.  DICKERSON: Ways and Means, uh-huh.  NORQUIST: And Ryan, Paul Ryan. Taking the corporate rate from 35 percent to 20 percent or 15 percent, I prefer Trump\u2019s 15, but 20\u2019s progress -- would be tremendous for economic growth. Going to full expensing, which both plans haven\u2019t, would shoot up growth. You\u2019d look at growth going from 2 percent to 4 percent. And the most important thing that the president and the House and Senate can do is get economic growth back on path.  We\u2019ve had a very anemic growth and recovery. We\u2019ve been in recovery for seven and a half years, but it\u2019s been the lousiest recovery in a long time. We need to be growing at 4 percent. If you grow for a decade at 4 percent instead of 2 percent, the federal government nets five plus trillion dollars in addition to revenue. (INAUDIBLE) higher taxes --  DICKERSON: Have we ever (INAUDIBLE) 4 percent for ten years?  NORQUIST: Under Reagan, yes.  DICKERSON: Well, he was only president for eight, but --  NORQUIST: No, no, but out until Bush decided to raise taxes and undo, unfortunately, what --  MACGUINEAS: So let me point out some of the differences though, because as a big proponent of tax reform, there actually are some important difference, which is the Donald Trump tax plan would lose trillions of dollars, where the members of the Republican Party are saying, tax reform should be revenue neutral. And I think that\u2019s a really important objective because --  NORQUIST: With dynamic -- dynamic scoring, which was very important.  MACGUINEAS: Because to add up with spending proposals, taking entitlements off the table, which I think is a very unwise idea and really stands in the way of getting this done, and dealing with the debt, you can\u2019t have a big loss from your tax reform.  In terms of growing the economy, there\u2019s a big difference now than when we saw growth before. Right now our economy is projected to grow at about 2 percent. And Donald Trump talked about growth rates of twice or three times that much. But we have a big challenge, which is changing demographics. As the baby boomers all move into retirement, in order to get those higher growth rates, you\u2019d have to have productivity levels we\u2019ve actually never seen in this country.  So I think one thing that\u2019s really important here is, let\u2019s aspire to grow the economy. You do that through tax reform, through public investments, but you also do that for paying for your proposals and controlling the debt. But let\u2019s not wish for it and assume sort of magical numbers that are unlikely to materialize.  FRUM: If you want to do those things -- if you want to do those things and the things that Grover\u2019s talking about, I would agree with all of them, more or less. If you want to do those things, you have to prevent this administration from being devoured and consumed by scandal. We are -- the -- Donald Trump has made it pretty clear, his plan is to run the least transparent and probably the least ethical administration in a long, long time. If that is not -- if any of this is to happen, this administration must be Trump-proofed. The president is up to no good. He\u2019s made that very clear. He\u2019s got -- he\u2019s indicating to the Japanese, this is -- if you\u2019ve got business with me, this is the person to talk. He\u2019s indicating to the Indians, if you have business with me, these are the people to talk to. If he does that, I guarantee, 18 months from now, when you convene the show, you\u2019ll not be talking about taxes, you \u2018ll not be talking about debt, you\u2019ll be talking about the latest Trump scandal, act now to save the country, the political system and the Republican Party from the things this president seems to have in mind.  DICKERSON: Let me ask another question, Lanhee, of you about other ways capital can be spent, which is we\u2019ve talked about budget and tax reform, but there are other things Trump has on the priorities list. Immigration is one of them. How hard do you think that will be and do you think that will expend some capital, in terms of political capital, that then can\u2019t be used on these very hard other things, tax reform, Medicare and so forth?  CHEN: I think it\u2019s a very dangerous thing to start with. I mean, obviously, it was a campaign priority, so it\u2019s important to the president-elect. We recognize that that\u2019s going to be a priority for this administration. But you think about all of the other important issues, and we\u2019ve talked about some them. Certainly tax reform. What\u2019s going to happen with Obamacare? This is something that has been a signature issue for Republicans for the last six year since the law was passed and signed into law. What is going to be done in terms of the repeal, and more importantly I think is the question about what you\u2019re going to replace it with. \u2018  You know, I\u2019m a little alarmed that we seem to be thinking that we can kick the can down the road on the replacement of the Affordable Care Act. There are some very important policy goals that Republicans have been working to accomplish for some time. For example, parity in the tax treatment of health care between those who get their health care from their employers and those who why it on their own. That is something that should be a focus of the discussion. And we need to be focusing on that first, I think, rather than some of these other issues, which, frankly, I don\u2019t think have as much potential to grow the economy, certainly not in a way that Mr. Trump has talked about them.  DICKERSON: Grover?  NORQUIST: Well, I think on health care, and Trump has spoken to this, allowing people from New Jersey to buy their insurance from companies in Iowa, allowing you to cross borders, even the government said that would drop the cost about 15 percent. That\u2019s an important reform that makes all the other reforms easier. We need to get spending down, as well as regulations. We\u2019ve been talking about taxes, but the Reduce Act that Ken Calvert has put forward to reduce a number of civilian employees at the Pentagon by 15 percent. They\u2019ve grown 15 percent in the Bush-Obama years.  DICKERSON: But they\u2019re going to grow more under -- under Donald Trump, who\u2019s -- who\u2019s talking about a big plus up in spending on defense.  NORQUIST: First of all he wants to -- well, he wants to talk about putting more troops on. But I\u2019m talking about the civilian employees. Troops have gone down 4 percent during that period. The civilian population has gone up 15 percent. What Reduce Act does is simply takes it back down 15 percent, back to where it had been, compared to the number of troops you have. That saves $80 billion in five years. That\u2019s an important reform. And if we\u2019re going to do more on the military in some areas, we need to get rid of the wasteful spending that we don\u2019t need to do. And Calvert\u2019s got a very important bill.  DICKERSON: Maya, let me ask --  MACGUINEAS: But --  DICKERSON: Add to whatever your answer was going to be in the last 40 seconds here. Donald Trump, trillion dollar infrastructure bill. How does that fit in the coming budget, challenges that exist?  MACGUINEAS: Right. So infrastructure is one of the few areas where both Democrats and Republicans tend to agree that we need to do more spending there. But if you look at what the Congressional Budget Office found, we know that infrastructure can be a very important component of an economic growth strategy. But they also found that if you borrow to do that, it will actually shrink the economy. The same way that Wharton found that if you borrow to do a big tax cut, it could shrink the economy.  So I think the problem that we have, the big challenges, one, Grover\u2019s focusing on the spending. That\u2019s really the smaller parts of the budget. I think we need to look at the big parts of the budget, back to entitlements. That\u2019s 50 percent of the budget, 75 percent of the growth. And, two, if you want to grow the economy, you can\u2019t borrow your way to growth. We have to get control of the national debt. So they\u2019re going to have to make choices. That\u2019s what budgets are. It\u2019s about choices. We are moving from campaigning to governing and now we have to look at the real choices. DICKERSON: All right, we\u2019re going to have to stop it there.  We\u2019ll look forward to having you come back and talking about the choices later. Thanks to all of you.  And I want to be -- just stay with us. We\u2019ll be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we\u2019re joined now by Max Stier, an expert in presidential transitions, and is president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service.  Max, I just want to start with, give us a sense of the scope of a transition.  MAX STIER, PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION EXPERT: Transitions are huge when you think about this. It\u2019s the largest, most important takeover of any organization, not just on the planet, but in history. You have a $4 trillion organization, you have four million people when you count the military, you have 4,000 political appointees, and I might add, that\u2019s a little bit of a vestige of this spoil system, so talk about drain the swamp, another conversation. It\u2019s a -- 1,100 of those 4,000 have to go through the Senate confirmation process.  You have to put together a budget. You have to deal with not only all the things that are coming at you, but things you cannot expect. The asteroids that inevitably take place in a world as dangerous as this one.  DICKERSON: And so that\u2019s why both campaigns, although now only it cares -- matters that the Trump campaign started their transition work a while ago. But how much, if they started months ago, of this work is really -- can be done ahead of time?  STIER: Well, you\u2019re exactly right. If you only focus on the period between the election and the inauguration, there\u2019s no possible way that you can be ready. You have to start earlier. Both campaigns did. Clinton and Trump did very, very strong work. The hard part comes now because, you\u2019re right, there\u2019s only so much you can do pre- election and then you have to merge your campaign and your transition apparatus, but you have to move over real fast.  Most folks, I think, are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. They\u2019re examining one or two appointments as they come forward here. The reality is that you have to look at, what are the goals that the transition teams are actually taking on? They ought to be taking on the proposition that they need to make sure that they have their team on the field, an equipped team from day one, from the second that they actually run the government. Transitions are also the point of maximum vulnerability for us in a post-9/11 world. We have to make sure that the new president has the team in place, that they have a game plan and they\u2019re ready to go from second one after they swear on that Bible.  DICKERSON: And how possible is that realistically, though, or -- or, if not, give us some number of months that it might take to -- to get a team fully in place?  STIER: Look, I think it is more than anybody can ever fully get done, but they have to move the ball further down the field than anyone has done it before. I think people are looking the wrong way when they look in the rear view mirror and say, how much did Barack Obama did, how much did President Bush do? The real question is, can you get that team in place, and the right team, in real time. For us that means making sure you have your White House fully staffed by right after the inauguration, that you have 100 of your top Senate confirmed people in place. And that means you\u2019ve got to move with dispatch and you have to be thinking about this as teams, not as single individuals, because you\u2019ll never get there if you add one, one, one. You\u2019ve got to do it in bigger -- bigger groups.  DICKERSON: So where is the Trump team on your got to move fast time line?  STIER: Well, too early to tell. I think the more important point is not how many people have they named, but rather have they embraced the objective -- the objective of making sure they actually are ready to go on day one, that they\u2019ll have their team in place, that they\u2019ll have their game plan designed and that they\u2019ve built the relationships that they need with critical steak holders, Congress, the federal workforce and others.  DICKERSON: Last 30 second. We\u2019ve talked about quantity. Talk about quality, though. Some of these people are going to be picked. You\u2019ll never hear about them, but they\u2019ll have real power.  STIER: You\u2019re 100 percent right. We\u2019ve actually been producing job descriptions, position descriptions of those 4,000 jobs. They don\u2019t exist otherwise. We need people here who are not just outsiders or not just people who have the policy alignment that the president- elect wants, but people who can actually manage -- manage real large organizations. You look in the past, whether it was Hurricane Katrina, healthcare.gov, these are management problems. We need to make sure the government is staffed at the very top leadership positions with the very best experienced people we can possibly get.  DICKERSON: All right, Max Stier, thank you so much for that description. We appreciate it.  STIER: Thank you.  DICKERSON: And we\u2019ll be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: That\u2019s it for us today. Thanks for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I\u2019m John Dickerson.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***",

            "article_content": "BEIJING - Donald Trump is a mixed blessing for Chinese leaders. The U.S. president-elect\u2019s threats to tear up trade deals and hike tariffs on Chinese goods look ominous. If carried out, they could chill thriving commercial ties at a time when Beijing is struggling to shore up economic growth. At the same time, Trump\u2019s suggestion he might reduce Washington\u2019s global strategic presence to focus on domestic issues would be a gift to Chinese leaders. They could expand their political and military profile in East Asia with less risk of conflict. The incoming Trump administration faces the task of maintaining influence in the face of rising Chinese strategic ambitions while accommodating Asian countries that are being drawn into Beijing\u2019s economic orbit. That calls for more nimble diplomacy that transcends the security-focused \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d and caters to countries\u2019 desire for a balanced relationship between Washington and Beijing, analysts say. It will require greater economic and diplomatic engagement, drawing on America\u2019s soft power assets in culture, media and education. China is \u201cwithout doubt trying to subvert American alliances and relationships,\u201d including in Europe, Australia and South Korea, said Michael Montesano, a research fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. That\u2019s been abetted by \u201cdepressingly unimaginative\u201d U.S. diplomacy in Asia that is focused too narrowly on military alliances and is now hobbled by Washington\u2019s failure to advance the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact, Montesano said. Over U.S. objections, Beijing has moved to cement its claim to most of the South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and military airstrips atop coral reefs. On strategic issues, Chinese researchers have \u201ccome around to the view that Donald Trump is better for China,\u201d said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center at Tsinghua University in Beijing. \u201cThere is a sense among many that Donald Trump will draw inward,\u201d said Haenle. \u201cThis is music to their ears, because this means that the U.S. might not put pressure on China in the region.\u201d Beijing has been visited in recent weeks by leaders from the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam, highlighting its economic appeal and lack of interest in their internal affairs, especially corruption and human rights -- issues the U.S. is seen as harping on. Still, it would be \u201cpremature to write off the U.S.,\u201d said Carlyle Thayer, an expert on Southeast Asia and emeritus professor at Australia\u2019s University of New South Wales. \u201cThe U.S. has important equities in the region through investment and trade,\u201d said Thayer. \u201cAnd the U.S. has a national interest in preventing China from becoming a hegemonic power over the region.\u201d As for the Philippines\u2019 unpredictable new president, Rodrigo Duterte, the new administration would be best advised to \u201cride out the Duterte storm and let domestic politics in the Philippines take its course,\u201d said Thayer. Meanwhile, concerns about China\u2019s intentions will propel governments such as Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam toward closer ties with the U.S., Australia, Japan and India, said Greg Poling of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. How will Donald Trump deal with China on politically volatile commercial issues? Despite his threats of a trade war, no one is sure -- probably not even Trump himself. But businesspeople and economists say Washington is bound to be tougher on trade, market access and currency after the election laid bare Americans\u2019 anxiety about jobs and stagnant wages. Uncertainty about where Trump wants to take the world\u2019s biggest economy has caused turmoil in global financial markets. The answer -- and especially how that affects ties with China and its second-largest global economy -- could have been even bigger repercussions. Trump is unlikely to carry out his most extreme threats to tear up trade deals or slap 45 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, say economists. But they say high-visibility gestures such as declaring Beijing manipulates its exchange rate to boost exports -- a step that can trigger penalties -- look more likely. \u201cIt has been clear for some time that whoever wins the White House is going to be tougher on China by necessity,\u201d said Randal Phillips, vice chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. \u201cAnd I think, frankly, the Chinese government has known that for several years.\u201d Phillips and others warn that Chinese leaders will need to be sensitive to American public sentiment to avoid disrupting their access to U.S. consumers. At the top of the U.S. wish list is more access to China\u2019s growing market, where finance, telecoms and a wide swath of other industries are mostly off-limits. Foreign governments assumed China would open up as it grew richer. But business groups complain Beijing is trying instead to squeeze foreign rivals out of technology and other promising industries in violation of its free-trade commitments. The U.S., along with Germany and other trading partners, is increasingly frustrated that its companies are blocked from buying Chinese assets in most industries while China Inc. is on a global acquisition spree. \u201cIt\u2019s just not acceptable anymore,\u201d said Phillips. That could help Washington recruit allies to pressure Beijing, said Haenle of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center. He noted Germany, the biggest economy in the 28-nation European Union, is becoming more assertive in demanding \u201creciprocity and market access.\u201d Washington will talk to the EU \u201cto see what can be done on this issue,\u201d Haenle said. Others warn reckless action could backfire. \u201cThe biggest threats to the economy stem from Trump\u2019s protectionist stance on trade, anti-immigration policies and the weakening of government finances stemming from expected tax cuts,\u201d Sarah Boumphrey of Euromonitor International said in a report. Trump\u2019s election adds to the urgency of winding up negotiations begun in 2013 on a bilateral investment treaty before President Barack Obama leaves office, said Jake Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents some 200 companies. His group sees the measure, which would guarantee the legal status of investments in each other\u2019s markets, as the best way to increase access to the China. \u201cThis may offer an opportunity to accelerate the negotiations,\u201d Parker said. China\u2019s government tried to remind Washington that both sides benefit from one of the world\u2019s biggest commercial relationships despite chronic disputes. \u201cBilateral trade over the past decades has tangibly benefited the U.S. people and created jobs instead of harming their interests,\u201d said a foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang. Tough talk on China has featured in every U.S. presidential campaign since 1992, when then-candidate Bill Clinton dubbed the ruling Communist Party the \u201cbutchers of Beijing.\u201d Once elected, Clinton set that aside and persuaded Congress to grant China low-tariff \u201cmost-favored nation\u201d status. Other candidates have taken a similar approach. \u201cWhat he said during the campaign, that\u2019s not government policy,\u201d said James Zimmerman, the American chamber\u2019s chairman. \u201cGovernment policy really requires thoughtful discussion, dialogue and compromise.\u201d Companies and economists were waiting to see whether Trump follows tradition. \u201cThis scenario is still subject to considerable uncertainty,\u201d said Boumphrey. \u201cRepublicans will control both houses [of Congress], which would ordinarily make for more certainty, but it is unclear how many of his policies the party will support.\u201d",

            "article_content": "11:28 p.m. Donald Trump claims that NATO countries \u2014 along with Japan and South Korea \u2014 don't pay enough to the United States for the defense our country provides them. TRUMP STATEMENT: \"We defend Japan. We defend Germany. We defend South Korea. We defend Saudi Arabia. We defend countries. They do not pay us what they should be paying us because we are providing a tremendous service. And we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing. We lose on everything. All I said is that it is very possible that if they don't pay us, because this isn't 40 years ago\u2026 they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.\" FACT CHECK: According to the Wall Street Journal, South Korea paid about $866.6 million in 2014 to the U.S. for the American military presence in the country (which is meant to deter North Korea). That's about 40 percent of the total cost. For Japan this year, the country actually covers 90 percent of the cost of Japanese nationals employed by U.S. military bases, including most of the utility costs, rent, and noise abatement. Altogether, the Japanese pay $4 billion of U.S. \"base-related expenses.\" On the whole, Trump's comment about the U.S. shouldering an undue burden under NATO in defense expenditures is not entirely off base. U.S. expenditures as a share of GDP is 3.61 percent, whereas the next closest contributor is Greece's share (2.38 percent of Greece's GDP). Most of the partner nations pay quite a bit less than the suggested two percent of GDP that NATO puts in its guidelines.  --CBS News' Donald Judd 11:19 p.m. Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton has spent \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" on negative ads against him and that he is now \"winning or tied\" in the polls after spending \"practically nothing.\" TRUMP STATEMENT: \"She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue, they're untrue and they're misrepresentations and I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice and I don't deserve that. But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads and the only gratifying thing is, I saw the the polls come in today and with all of that money over $200 million spent and I'm either winning or tied and I've spent practically nothing.\" FACT CHECK: This is partially false. Clinton has not yet spent \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" on advertising \u2013 she has spent just about $100 million overall. Clinton spent $109.4 million on ads through Sept. 13, according to Bloomberg, compared to Trump's $18.7 million. A Politico article from Aug. 23 cited data from Advertising Analytics as saying that 55 percent of Clinton's ads were attacks on Trump and 45 percent were positive spots.  However, he is correct in saying that he has spent \"practically nothing\" on ads compared to Clinton (so far \u2013 although his campaign said he's preparing a $140 million investment) and he is tied in many polls (though not winning in most). --CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan 10:55 p.m. Hillary Clinton claims Donald Trump would not rent apartments to African-Americans. CLINTON STATEMENT:\u00a0\"Donald Trump started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood the policy. He was actually sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.\" \u00a0\u00a0 FACT CHECK:\u00a0The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in 1973 against Trump Management, a company led by Trump, who was its president, alleging they used tactics to discriminate against black tenants, according to an August investigation by the Los Angeles Times. A 1973 New York Times story said that the Justice Department \"charged that the company had required different rental terms and conditions because of race and that it had misrepresented to blacks that apartments were not available.\" In what was the first quote from Trump ever published by the Times, he said of the charges \"They are absolutely ridiculous ... we have never discriminated ... and we never would.\" And he counter-sued. Trump and DOJ came to an agreement two years later in which Trump Management \"promised not to discriminate\u00a0against blacks, Puerto Ricans and other minorities,\" according to a June 11, 1975 New York Times story.\u00a0 --CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan 10:53 p.m. Donald Trump claims 800 immigrants who should have been deported became citizens. TRUMP STATEMENT: \"The other day we were deporting eight hundred people and perhaps they pressed the wrong button --they pressed the wrong button-- or perhaps worse than that it was corruption. But these people we were going to deport \u2026 for good reason ended up becoming citizens--ended up becoming citizens. And it was eight hundred and now it turns out, it might be fifteen hundred and they don't even know.\" FACT CHECK: Trump was referring to a Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) report released on Sept. 19, which explained that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) granted citizenship to at least 858 people from \"special interest countries\" who had been ordered to be deported under a different name. This happened because federal government agencies' databases do not have all old fingerprint records of people who have been previously deported. --CBS News' Caroline Horn 10:49 p.m. Donald Trump claims that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) controls a lot of the oil in Libya. TRUMP STATEMENT: \u00a0ISIS has \"oil all over the place, including the oil, a lot of the oil, in Libya.\" FACT CHECK: According to a Bloomberg analysis, Libyan oil fields and pipelines are controlled by a combination of the Government of National Accord, allies of the Tripoli Petroleum Facilities Guard, and the Libyan National Army (and groups aligned with them). Claudia Gazzini, a Tripoli-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told the Washington Post that it was simply not true that the Islamic State has control of any Libyan oil. \"While it is true that ISIS has attacked oil fields in the Sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there, they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields,\" Gazzini said.  --CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan 10:44 p.m. Donald Trump claims \"stop and frisk\" policies in New York City worked well and brought the crime rate \"way down.\" TRUMP STATEMENT: Debate moderator Lester Holt said, \"'Stop and frisk' was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men\u2014\" Trump replied: \"No, you're wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal.\" FACT CHECK: In Floyd v. City of New York, U.S. District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin \u2014 a Bill Clinton appointee \u2013 found \"stop and frisk\" policies in New York City violated the Constitution's Fourth \u00a0and Fourteenth Amendments. Scheindlin ordered the city to reform the policies.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration appealed the ruling, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals suspended the order. The court sent it back to be tried under a new judge. Ultimately, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio decided not to pursue the appeal upon election in 2014, meaning Scheindlin's ruling was held and the appeal was dropped. Trump said murder is up in New York City, but murder is actually down 4.3 percent this year-to-date. The murder rate, however, is up 7.9 percent over the last two years \u2014 which is probably what Trump means since 2014 is the last time \"stop and frisk\" was implemented in New York.  --CBS News' Donald Judd\u00a0 10:41 p.m. Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump's various businesses have filed for bankruptcy six times. CLINTON STATEMENT: \"When we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great business people who haven't taken bankruptcy once.\" FACT CHECK: Clinton is correct. When Politifact looked into this issue, they found six times that Trump has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection: The Trump Taj Mahal in 1991; Trump Castle in 1992; Trump Plaza and Casino in 1992; the Plaza Hotel in 1992; Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts in 2004; and Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2009. --CBS News' Jillian Hughes 10:36 p.m. Donald Trump claims that Hillary Clinton started the \"birther\" movement. TRUMP STATEMENT: \"Well, it's very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and a very close friend of Secretary Clinton, and her campaign manager, Patty Doyle, went to\u2014they were in the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard, and you can go look it up and you can check it out, and if you look at CNN this past week, Patty Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, a highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it, they were pressing it very hard, she failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved, I didn't fail, I got him to give the birth certificate.\" FACT CHECK: This has been Trump's line since the \"birther\" issue resurfaced this fall, but Clinton's campaign has repeatedly denied being involved. Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton's 2008 campaign manager, told Wolf Blitzer a volunteer forwarded an email promoting \"birtherism\" and that that person was fired. \"The campaign nor Hillary did not start the 'birther' movement, period, end of story,\" Solis Doyle told CNN, saying the volunteer's actions were \"beyond the pale\" and that Clinton called Obama campaign manager David Plouffe to apologize. Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton confidante but not a current campaign staffer, denies ever contacting McClatchy; the former McClatchy bureau chief, James Asher, recently said he clearly recalled the conversation with Blumenthal. --CBS News' Donald Judd 10:28 p.m. Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump supported the invasion of Iraq. CLINTON STATEMENT: \"Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.\" (Trump replied: \"I did not support the war in Iraq.\") FACT CHECK: Donald Trump supported the invasion of Iraq. Howard Stern interview interviewed Donald Trump on Sept. 11, 2002, noted BuzzFeed. \"Are you for invading Iraq?\" Howard Stern asked him, and Trump answered, \"Yeah, I guess so.\" --CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan 10:17 p.m. Hillary Clinton claims Donald Trump did not pay workers what he owed them.\u00a0 CLINTON STATEMENT: \"Your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of other people. I have met a lot of the people who are stiffed by your business. I've met gardeners, dishwashers, architects, glass installers, drapery installers, like my dad was who you refused to pay when they finished the work you asked them to do. We have one of the architects in the audience who designed one of the clubhouses of your golf course. It's a beautiful facility. It was immediately put to use, and you wouldn't pay what you said you would pay him.\" FACT CHECK:\u00a0Clinton was referring to architect Andrew Tesoro, who is featured in a\u00a0Clinton campaign video\u00a0saying thatTrump didn't pay his firm thousands of dollars. But Tesoro was also interviewed by Forbes in July and said despite being shorted \"a huge amount of money,\" he thinks Trump is \"basically a nice guy. I'm fond of him.\" USA Today did a further analysis of worker payments and found Trump, \"has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades \u2014 and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans \u2026 who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them\" --CBS News' Jillian Hughes 10:14 p.m. Donald Trump says national debt has doubled under Obama. TRUMP STATEMENT: \"The Obama administration from the time they've come in is over two hundred thirty years worth of debt. And he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years\u2014 seven and a half years to be semi-exact.\" FACT CHECK: Not quite. It's increased 83.7 percent. On the day President Obama took office, the national debt was $10,626 trillion; as of today, it's $19,526 trillion.  --CBS News' Mark Knoller 10:10 p.m. Hillary Clinton says the \"gun epidemic\" is the top cause of death among African Americans. CLINTON STATEMENT:\u00a0\"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African American men, more than the next nine causes put together.\" FACT CHECK:\u00a0This is true: 2014 CDC data shows that 1,505 black males age 20-24 died of homicide by firearm. The next nine leading causes of death together totaled 1,424. --CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan 10:07 p.m. Donald Trump claims that his lawyers have told him not to release his tax returns. TRUMP STATEMENT: \"My lawyers say don't do it. In fact watching the shows, reading the papers\u2026almost every lawyer says you don't release your returns until the audit is complete. When the audit is complete I'll do it.\" FACT CHECK: In the letter from Trump's lawyers released by his campaign, they do NOT say the taxes should not be released. Trump's tax returns from 2002 through 2008 are closed administratively by agreement with the IRS. Audits for years 2009 and forward are ongoing. An IRS spokesperson also told the Washington Post that nothing \u2014 including an audit \"prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information.\"\u00a0 --CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan 10:05 p.m. Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump thinks climate change is a \"hoax.\" CLINTON STATEMENT: \"Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.\" (Trump replied: \"I did not. I did not. I do not say that.\") FACT CHECK: On Nov. 6, 2012, Trump tweeted this: \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\" --CBS News' Caroline Horn 10:01 p.m. Hillary Clinton claims her tax plan would create 10 million jobs. CLINTON STATEMENT: \"Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed\u2026 They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.\" FACT CHECK: Clinton is citing a Moody's analytics report as her independent expert, saying that \"During her presidency, the economy would create 10.4 million jobs, 3.2 million more than under current ;aw.\" The unemployment rate would also be lower under Clinton's proposals, falling to as low as 3.7 percent in the middle of Clinton's term. At the end of her presidency in 2020, the unemployment rate would be at 4.4 percent. The report, however puts a caveat on the 10 million jobs, noting that Congress would put up roadblocks to her proposals. Mark Zandi of Moody's has contributed to the Clinton campaign. \u00a0 --CBS News' Kate Rydell 9:59 p.m. Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. TRUMP STATEMENT: \"You want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it.\" FACTCHECK: Clinton has said she no longer supports TPP. During a Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas last October, Clinton said that as secretary of State she'd \"hoped it would be the gold standard,\" but that when the full details of the deal became available it didn't \"meet [her] standards.\" \"My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, 'this will help raise your wages,'\" she said. \"And I concluded I could not.\" --CBS News' Kate Rydell 9:54 p.m. Donald Trump says Ford is \"thousands of jobs\" are leaving Michigan and Ohio. TRUMP STATEMENT:\u00a0\"So Ford is leaving. Their small car division is leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan. Leaving Ohio. They're all leaving, and we can't allow it to happen anymore.\" FACT CHECK:\u00a0\"Their small car division is leaving\" \u2013 This part is true, but Ford says it will affect \"zero\" U.S. jobs. \"Over the next two to three years, we will have migrated all of our small-car production to Mexico and out of the United States,\" said Ford Motors CEO Mark Fields, at a daylong investor conference in Dearborn, Michigan, according to the Detroit Free Press. But this will, according to Fields, not result in any job loss in the U.S. Earlier this month, on Sept. 15, 2016, CNN's Poppy Harlow asked Fields, \"So it is not true that Ford will be, quote, 'firing all of its employees in the United States?' Will Ford cut any U.S. jobs as a result of this move? One? Any single one?\" \"Absolutely not. Zero,\" Fields responded.\u00a0 --CBS News' Jillian Hughes 9:50 p.m. Hillary Clinton claims that Donald Trump's tax plans would cause a spike in the national debt. CLINTON STATEMENT: \"Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald has proposed and basically they've said this: That if his tax plan which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle class families compared to the wealthy were to go into effect, we would lose three and a half million jobs and maybe have another recession.\" FACT CHECK: According to a recent report by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, \"Trump's plans would increase the debt by $5.3 trillion \u2026 [causing] debt to rise to above\" 105 percent. Trump's proposals, in other words, would \"substantially worsen the debt.\" Another report by Moody's analytics service says Trump's plans would also lose 3.5 million jobs across the country, with the unemployment rate rising to as high as seven percent \u2014 compared to the less than five percent unemployment rate today. The report says job losses would \"likely hit lower- and middle-income households the hardest.\"  --CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan 9:36 p.m. Hillary Clinton claims that Trump received $14 million from his father. CLINTON STATEMENT: \"He started his business with $14 million from his father.\" FACT CHECK: Trump has said on multiple occasions, including an NBC Today Show town hall last October, that his father gave him a \"small loan of a million dollars\" when he started off in business. However, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Trump took out numerous loans from his father and his father's properties toward the beginning of his career. They found that information in a casino-license disclosure in 1985 by Trump's then-wife, Ivana. At the time of that disclosure, the document said, he owed his father and his father's businesses approximately $14 million. --CBS News' Donald Judd 8:30 p.m. The first presidential debate is almost here: tonight, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump will share the stage for the first time.\u00a0 The candidates are at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., for a showdown moderated by NBC's Lester Holt. The three themes of the debate, which Holt announced last week, are \"America's Direction,\" \"Achieving Prosperity\" and \"Securing America.\" CBS News' team of fact-checkers are listening closely to both candidates and will be posting here when their statements need additional scrutiny. Check back here for updates throughout the debate. CBS News' Julia Boccagno contributed to this story. Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

And there\u2019s been plenty of anger and sadness. But there\u2019s also hope and good news. In a new FACE THE NATION tradition, we once again look over the year past and the year to come with Stephen Colbert. Then we\u2019ll turn to a CBS News tradition that\u2019s 66 years old, the year end correspondent roundtable. The faces have changed since then. The news moves at a faster pace. But the reporters of the Washington bureau still cover it all. It\u2019s all ahead on this special holiday broadcast of FACE THE NATION. Happy Holidays and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson. For our holiday broadcast last year, we sat down with the host of \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Stephen Colbert. The response was so positive, we thought we\u2019d do it again. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DICKERSON: So what was the good news in 2016? STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, \u201cTHE LATE SHOW\u201d: Well, that\u2019s a tough one. That\u2019s a tough one. We just had a bunch of people over for Thanksgiving. And before I gave the blessing, you know, for all the food we were about to eat, beforehand, I was thinking, well, what could I be thankful for? And I was really reminded of how our happiness really comes from our individual relationships. A nation is not its politics. A nation is its relationships between its people. And I was thankful for the people in the room. I was thankful for the people who were not there and could not be there because they were gone. And -- and I was thankful for the children who were -- who were growing up beautifully into people that I would want to be with and could entrust our country to. And -- and for the people that I don\u2019t agree with, you know, politically. I\u2019m thankful for them, as well. And so because... DICKERSON: But why are you thankful for the people you don\u2019t agree with? COLBERT: Because they make me think about what I do. They question my beliefs. And an unquestioned belief is almost vestigial. It doesn\u2019t motivate you in any way. It doesn\u2019t serve you in any way if you don\u2019t question it, because a -- a belief is a filter. You have to run things through it, you know, so you know how you see the world. It\u2019s a lens, it\u2019s not a prop. DICKERSON: Right. COLBERT: And so the good news is we\u2019re all still here. America is a great country. It\u2019s all just the relationships that we have with each other. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s the important thing and -- and that\u2019s the good news is -- is our ability to love each other and care for each other. And I saw that all through the year. DICKERSON: And so the question is whether -- whether that itself is a beneficial outcome of an election that has got a lot of people nervous. It sharpens the thinking. It forces people to think about the other things in their life, other than politics. If you believe that politics is not everything. COLBERT: Dividing into teams is great if your team wins. But if your team loses, it allows you to do two things. One is question why you lost. And, B, why did you choose to be on a team, because the team itself is an illusion. And so that was a -- that was something that I came to me at the end of the election special that we did. We did a live Showtime special and I had nothing to say, I didn\u2019t think, at the end of the show. DICKERSON: At what point of the night is it when you feel like I have nothing to say? What\u2019s happened? Do you know the outcome? COLBERT: As I knew the outcome, I knew that I would have to throw out everything I had planned, because we had four possible outcomes. One is that we knew that Mrs. Clinton would win. We would not know. It looked like Trump was going to win, but we wouldn\u2019t know until the morning. And then there was he\u2019s going to win and we know he\u2019s going to win. And that was the one that we prepared nothing for, which -- on purpose. I said, look, what\u2019s the purpose? Don\u2019t prepare anything because everything goes out the window. It\u2019s the least likely path it says -- say all of the number crunchers and I believe in numbers. And -- and if it happens, we\u2019re going to be doing a show for a group of people who have been hauled into a Chilean soccer stadium to watch people executed. People are going to be very depressed. So anyway, at the very end of it, one of the things that occurred to me to say was that it makes me question picking sides, because if you look at this like a -- a sport, if you look at it like as a battle against your neighbor, you\u2019ll choose anything as a knife against the other side. And that itself is a -- what\u2019s the opposite of a virtue? DICKERSON: A vice? COLBERT: Yes, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s a vice, political divisiveness is a vice. But like a lot of vices, super seductive. DICKERSON: Sure. COLBERT: And so you indulge in it until it bites you and then you go oh, darn -- oh, darn, the wages of sin is death. And it makes you question having indulged in the vice. And I think that political divisiveness is a vice, picking sides is a vice rather than picking ideas. DICKERSON: Is that a lesson you learned in the moment or is that how we should look at 2017? COLBERT: Oh, it\u2019s definitely a lesson you can learn in the moment, but boy, it\u2019s just hard to stay alert to that. I mean it\u2019s hard to do what I do for a living. I make jokes. And -- and -- and jokes have a little knife in them all of the time. And so it\u2019s hard to get away with it. I mean it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- what does it mean to you? DICKERSON: So if I learned a similar lesson, which is that you saw corrosiveness everywhere, you could -- one of the things you learn when you go out and talk to people in the country is that we\u2019re -- everybody is worried about their kids and whether they\u2019re going to get to go to college or they\u2019re worried about the next illness that their family member may have, regardless of what their parties are. And then the political conversation forces everybody back into their corners. So to seek -- to seek out humanity is the -- is -- and why things are important to human beings, not just a game. As you said, it\u2019s hard to stay alive to that constantly. Post-truth is the Oxford word of the year. COLBERT: I heard that. Yes. DICKERSON: Yes. So when we were last together and we talked... COLBERT: You mean at dinner? DICKERSON: Yes. (LAUGHTER) COLBERT: You mean a year ago? DICKERSON: Yes. COLBERT: OK. DICKERSON: A year ago, when we talked, you said -- I said what does it look -- the election look like for you? And you said it\u2019s all up for -- anything goes. COLBERT: I think I was right. DICKERSON: Yes. COLBERT: Anything goes. DICKERSON: You\u2019re Nostradamus. (LAUGHTER) COLBERT: That\u2019s exactly what -- the eagle shall fight the lion upon the plain near the river of Kech. DICKERSON: The reason that\u2019s the -- post-truth is the word of the year is because we saw facts play a role we\u2019ve never seen them play -- or not play a role we\u2019ve ever seen them play in politics. COLBERT: Well, that\u2019s the interesting thing. It\u2019s not like many years ago, I coined this word called truthiness about how -- preferring to believe what feels true to you rather than what you know the facts to be, but to very importantly say that you know the facts to be and then there\u2019s post-truth, which is not associated with the facts. As a matter of fact, one of Trump\u2019s surrogates, Scottie Nell Hughes, said that facts don\u2019t matter anymore, that there are no facts. That\u2019s truly in a whole new world. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s before God said let there be light. That\u2019s absolute chaos. And that scares me, the idea that facts don\u2019t exist anymore is actually scary to me, whereas if there are no facts anymore, then there is nothing to agree upon and so we can\u2019t agree. You can\u2019t build anything. DICKERSON: You\u2019ve got to agree on the measurement of things if you\u2019re building (INAUDIBLE)... COLBERT: What is one kilo? DICKERSON: Right. Or one cubit? COLBERT: Exactly. What is a cubit? Exactly. DICKERSON: You\u2019ve said don\u2019t get your news from me, meaning you, from your show... COLBERT: I did. I said get it from John Dickerson. DICKERSON: Yes. Well, thank you. I was fishing there and you -- it was very good. You know... COLBERT: That was at \u201cThe Wall Street Journal.\u201d DICKERSON: Yes. COLBERT: Last night, you got it for something else... (CROSSTALK) COLBERT: -- definitely don\u2019t get your -- definitely don\u2019t get your news from me. DICKERSON: Well, if facts are up for grabs and people are tuning into you, why not get the -- why not get a few facts from you? COLBERT: Because it\u2019s -- there are better sources than I am. I\u2019m just reading other things. But we -- we try to do jokes that are based on actual facts, because then you can build on them. The great thing about doing jokes about a presidential campaign is that from the conventions until election day, the job gets easier, because there\u2019s one story, everybody cares about it and nobody dies. So it -- it\u2019s not tragic. You can make jokes about it. You don\u2019t have to explain it to the audience and everybody is ready for the punch line as soon as you get out there. And so that\u2019s the great gift of covering the campaign. And then the more you get away from a centralized news story, one story in all the cycles, the more you have to explain things to the audience and the more important it is that you get the facts right. DICKERSON: And tell me about writing jokes about Donald Trump. COLBERT: That is not a question. That is a -- that is a -- that is tell me -- I do -- I will not tell you. I will not tell you. DICKERSON: How do you write jokes... COLBERT: -- that is (INAUDIBLE) Donald Trump (INAUDIBLE) question. There you go. (LAUGHTER) COLBERT: First of all... DICKERSON: You think... COLBERT: -- you demand your writers to write jokes about it. How do you write jokes about Donald Trump? Well, that actually asks the question, how do you write jokes about anything? You know, how do you write -- and a lot of times -- and this is where the conversation gets super boring, because there\u2019s nothing more boring than explaining a joke, is that there\u2019s something someone says, and then there\u2019s the way they behave. And in between -- in that arc is where all of the satire lives... DICKERSON: Yes. COLBERT: -- you know, or the subversion. Like those two -- that there\u2019s a little arc in there and the closer somebody is to the way they behave, the less fun they are to write jokes about. But Donald Trump speaks one way and behaves in another, you know. It\u2019s not -- not even 180 degrees. There\u2019s some odd, oblique angle going on with him. DICKERSON: A lot of Donald Trump\u2019s critics want -- or the Democrats who feel upset want kind of -- a kind of meaner humor. Is there a -- is there a pitch you don\u2019t want to swing at when you\u2019re writing jokes about Donald Trump? COLBERT: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s an interesting question, because, boy, the -- the balls come over the plate with him like shotgun pellets. It\u2019s not like one pitch at a time. Like you look at something that\u2019s happening, like, well, which one of those balls are we going to swing at, what he\u2019s talking about or how he\u2019s saying it or who he\u2019s saying it to and at what time and over Twitter? And I think Gingrich called it like, you know, he gets the press chasing the rabbit. Well, where do you stand? Like you\u2019re in the batting box, which one of these do you really want to swing at? And one of the things I had to say the week after Mr. Trump was elected is to say you have a four year story to tell, don\u2019t try to tell it all today. Tell what happened today with jokes. So it\u2019s a very long way of saying is there a pitch I don\u2019t want to swing at? The one that\u2019s not being thrown. DICKERSON: That was almost Zen. COLBERT: Well, that\u2019s how good I am, John. (LAUGHTER) DICKERSON: You talked about reflecting America and where America is. One of the things that we do is have focus groups. We\u2019ve done them at FACE THE NATION. If you had to do a focus group of the kind that we do, what would you ask people? COLBERT: Oh, I would say what makes them most hopeful, what makes you most hopeful, because, you know, slightly less than half of the voters voted for the president, or the president-elect. But it\u2019s statistically half of America. And I want to know what makes them most hopeful and then just keep that in mind as you go forward and go, OK, well, did the person fulfill that hope? DICKERSON: What did you learn about interviewing this year? COLBERT: Don\u2019t hold a pen, because I\u2019m not a newsman. I was interview -- I forgot who I was interviewing and the challenge for me and maybe the motivation for your question is that I used to do the show -- I used to interview people on character. And I had an agenda. I was going to win the interview. And it was fun to win it. Now, myself, so I\u2019m responsible for everything I\u2019m saying and that -- that made me sort of pull my natural punch in interviews for the first probably six months of the show. And on of my producers just said -- came out to me and said it was -- it was between two acts. He said put your pen away. And I -- and I said, OK. And so I literally just put the pen away. And it changed the way I spoke to the person, because then I\u2019m just having a conversation with someone. But holding the pen, it\u2019s like I\u2019m keeping score of what they\u2019re saying and I\u2019m going to have the (INAUDIBLE) and it became a human conversation. Later, I said, why did you ask me to do that? It really worked. And then he goes, because you\u2019re not the news. You\u2019re not even parodying the news. Just put it down. DICKERSON: That feels like it has a larger meaning somehow. COLBERT: It does. Yes, in a way. Just be your... DICKERSON: (INAUDIBLE). COLBERT: -- really, just be yourself. The pen was the last bit of the armor. Yes. DICKERSON: So if you had to do FACE THE NATION, how would you do the show? COLBERT: Just like you. (LAUGHTER) COLBERT: No, we watch it every Sunday. DICKERSON: You\u2019ll get something extra in your pay packet for that. COLBERT: Thank you very much -- thanks very much. DICKERSON: Oh, good. What did you learn doing the show live? COLBERT: We did two live weeks for the conventions and then we did all of the debates live then we did election night live. I -- I was reminded of -- of how important urgency is in writing. And it\u2019s not the same thing as anxiety. And there\u2019s a fine line between anxiety and urgency. When you know that there probably won\u2019t be another draft of this, you -- something clicks inside of you, if you have enough experience to do it. And it\u2019s not for the feint of heart. You write it right the first time, the joke comes out of you the way you are going to say it. You don\u2019t overthink it. And we -- we wrote some of our best shows this year in a matter of a couple of hours, or sometimes like 45 minutes or a half an hour. Everyone steps up... DICKERSON: Which... COLBERT: -- and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what the live show does, it asks what is the most you are capable of? And it gives you then something that\u2019s worthy of that effort, which is you\u2019re making jokes live about a historical event. DICKERSON: If you could take three things from this year that gave you joy, they can be anything, what would they be? (LAUGHTER) COLBERT: I spend so much of my time inside this building working on the show that it\u2019s hard to divorce like my joy from things that happened this year. DICKERSON: Well, that\u2019s where -- you can put that on the list. COLBERT: Oh, I think the night before the election, we had Stevie Wonder on. And we had Jon Stewart on and we basically did a song urging people to vote with Javier Munos from \u201cHamilton\u201d and then Stevie Wonder came on. We have the same birthday and he sang to me, \u201cHappy birthday to ya,\u201d you know, from \u201cHotter Than July,\u201d that -- that birthday song. That\u2019s probably the most joyful thing that happened in this building this year, because there\u2019s nobody like Stevie Wonder. Oh, I don\u2019t know, taking my son to college was pretty joyful. Seeing that he seemed happy there, that was really joyful, because you worry, you know. Spoiler alert -- if you don\u2019t have children yet, you will worry. And that\u2019s good, too. And I -- and I -- I have a -- I have a dear friend that I love who was diagnosed with cancer. And when she got subsequent tests back, it was exactly what she wanted to hear -- treatable. She has a plan. And that was the most joyful moment. And I just found out a week ago -- the most joyful moment you could hear is that this person that you love will be with you so you can love them. That\u2019s it. (END VIDEO TAPE) DICKERSON: We\u2019ll be back in one minute with more of our interview with \u201cThe Late Show\u2019s\u201d Stephen Colbert. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we\u2019re back with more of our wide-ranging interview with \u201cThe Late Show\u2019s\u201d Stephen Colbert. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DICKERSON: What should Donald Trump read, if you could give him one thing that he should read before being president? COLBERT: Well, \u201cThe Constitution\u201d wouldn\u2019t hurt, because I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s as familiar with it as -- as -- as one would hope. And it\u2019s a pretty good read. It\u2019s a pretty good read. It was well thought out. That\u2019s a good question, what would Donald Trump read? I actually don\u2019t know what he\u2019s lacking in information. I mean if we were to believe his ghost writer, he might want to read \u201cArt of The Deal,\u201d because he said he didn\u2019t write a word of it. So it\u2019s possible he hasn\u2019t read it either. I have. I\u2019ve read \u201cArt of The Deal.\u201d Have you heard \u201cArt of The Deal?\u201d DICKERSON: Yes. What did you take away from reading \u201cArt of The Deal?\u201d COLBERT: Well, if it was a reflection of the man, is that he\u2019ll be friends with anybody. He\u2019s like -- he comes off as a very friendly guy, even people he\u2019s angry with, he\u2019s actually very friendly with. DICKERSON: And I was struck that the stories he tells in the book are of people being generous and magnanimous and of keeping their word even when there was a better deal on the table. COLBERT: Um-hmm. DICKERSON: The virtues that he extols... COLBERT: Yes. DICKERSON: -- in others are... COLBERT: Yes. DICKERSON: -- not ones that people would... COLBERT: We\u2019ve had our disagreements over the years, but we did this deal. DICKERSON: Given that you and he have had disagreements, would he come on the show? Would you want him on to interview? COLBERT: I\u2019m not going to say no to the president of the United States. I want want to know that I could interview him in a way that would be respectful, though, because I don\u2019t think it would be fun for me or profitable for him in any way, or the audience, if I couldn\u2019t do it in a respectful way and I think -- I think probably by the time he gets into office, I\u2019ll have calmed down a little bit, because that would be important to me, because I believe in the presidency and I believe in our system and -- and, you know, when I had him on at the beginning of the year, I went to great pains to try to be respectful to him, which really upset some of my liberal fans. But it\u2019s important to me to have a politician on and to allow them to be able to say what their -- their -- their thoughts are and not be some sort of, you know, what -- what people often wanted me to be at the old show, which is some sort of ninja word assassin that slips underneath everybody\u2019s radar and then slaps the handle on the knife before they even know that it\u2019s between their ribs. Like that -- that was sort of the legend of -- but I almost never did it. It was almost by accident when I would do it. And I don\u2019t really want to do that with my guests ever. DICKERSON: What are you looking forward to in the new year? (LAUGHTER) COLBERT: We\u2019ve been so busy with the election that I think I\u2019m actually going to lose weight over the Christmas holidays, because just the cortisol will leave my body. Just getting enough sleep, I think is -- is going to at least get me down into my fat pants. When... (LAUGHTER) COLBERT: -- when your fat pants -- when you... (LAUGHTER) COLBERT: -- I can\u2019t do the show in sweatpants. I don\u2019t think that would look good, how about that? DICKERSON: No, I think that\u2019s right. COLBERT: What am I looking forward to? I\u2019m looking forward to being surprised, because that\u2019s what you want every day. I want to be surprised. And that\u2019s the great thing about Donald Trump is that boy, he did surprise a lot of people, didn\u2019t he? And every day, you would say, can you believe this happened? And then you would go get to tell that story to the audience? And Mr. Trump is such a large figure that he will continue to be, I think, the story that we can tell with jokes on a daily basis, because he keeps breaking rules -- he -- or -- or norms, not rules. He keeps on breaking norms. And the breaking of those norms is such a surprising thing that it\u2019s like a fire cracker every day. And you get to report on the sound of that fire cracker every day. I\u2019m -- you know, people have asked me before, aren\u2019t you a little glad that Donald Trump was elected? And I go well, like, yes, but I don\u2019t -- I mean as a comedian, sure, but I -- I value something more than the joke I\u2019m about to tell. But now I have no choice but to actually enjoy this incredible gift every day that Mr. Trump will be. DICKERSON: I\u2019m going on in half an hour as you, what do I have to know? COLBERT: You can\u2019t teach me everything. Do you know how to listen? DICKERSON: You are the better judge now of that than I am. COLBERT: You have to know how to listen to your guests, because in half an hour, that you\u2019re going -- you\u2019re going from zero to 60 like you -- you are dragged off the street. A bag was popped over your head, you were brought in back stage, they put you in makeup and whipped it off your head and said you\u2019re on in half an hour. And you say, what am I doing? And you go, well, you\u2019re going to -- I hope you were informed about the news of the day, which I would imagine that you are already, you being John Dickerson. You\u2019ve got that John Dickerson feeling. One assumes you\u2019ve got it in spades. And you have to be able to read, because you\u2019re reading off of a prompter. You have to be able to improvise because if the joke goes particularly well, you want to filigree off the back end of it. You have to know how to be happy with failing. You have to know how to still enjoy it if the joke doesn\u2019t go over well and also be prepared to not blame anybody other than yourself for whether it goes well, because -- because it really is just you. You\u2019re it. Tag, you\u2019re it, you know? You know what? I -- can I go back to something that Trump should read? This is my answer to what Trump should read. I don\u2019t know about what book he should read, but he should definitely read the plaque that says \u201cthe buck stops here,\u201d because he\u2019s famous for blaming other people for something going wrong. That\u2019s over. The buck stops at that desk. And I hope he\u2019s read it, because the first time he blames something else for somebody -- the first time he blames somebody else for something that he did, I think even people who like him will lose faith, because however you feel about the president, you\u2019ve got to take the punch. DICKERSON: Thank you. COLBERT: Thanks. DICKERSON: I\u2019m going to shake your hand. COLBERT: You\u2019re going to shake my hand? DICKERSON: Yes. COLBERT: All right. DICKERSON: That\u2019s very weird. COLBERT: If you don\u2019t do that all the time. DICKERSON: Oh, yes? COLBERT: OK. DICKERSON: All right, Stephen Colbert. COLBERT: I don\u2019t know where that hand has been. (LAUGHTER) COLBERT: It\u2019s like we just met. I\u2019ve known you for years. Who is this person? DICKERSON: There\u2019s a lot more of this interview that will be available on our Web site, facethenation.com. In fact, there\u2019s so much more that we\u2019re going to release a new clip every day for the next seven days, just enough to make it through the holiday week. So for our seven days of Stephen Colbert, go to our Web site or Twitter or Facebook for those clips. (END VIDEO TAPE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Be sure to join us next Sunday, when we\u2019ll be talking about the challenges facing America with a book panel including Isabel Wilkerson, who wrote \u201cThe Warmth of Other Suns,\u201d JD Vance, author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d actor Diane Guerrero, the author of \u201cIn the Country We Love\u201d and Amana Al-Khatahtbeh, author of \u201cMuslim Girl: A Coming of Age.\u201d (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Some of our CBS stations are leaving us now, but for most of you, we\u2019ll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION and our favorite old tradition, the CBS News correspondents roundtable. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson. Joining us now to talk about the year ahead, our CBS News foreign affairs correspondence Margaret Brennan, chief White House correspondence Major Garrett, homeland security and justice department correspondent Jeff Pegues and our chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, national security correspondent David Martin and congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes. Welcome to all of you, to our Thanksgiving dinner here. Major I want to start with you. MAJOR GARRETT, CBS NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Sure. DICKERSON: Thanksgiving on Christmas. You spent the year with Donald Trump. What do you expect from Donald Trump right away? GARRETT: So I think the country better brace itself for a couple of political realities. First of all, you have a largely non- ideological president surrounding himself by conservative ideologues and he has the largest Republican majorities that a conservative oriented Republican president has had since before the Great Depression. This Trump administration will have a largely cooperative Republican Congress and they will move with as much speed as they possibly can, understanding the Democrats are still in disarray, the Democrats are going to have to pick their targets, they\u2019re going to create as many targets as possible for the Democrats, hoping to overwhelm them and to move both on a regulatory, executive action and legislative front and throw in a Supreme Court nominee, all right out of the gate. An amazing sort of action to push forward an agenda they hope will be, if not fully realized, and nearly fully realized by August, and then sit back and watch what happens. DICKERSON: Nancy, a flurry of activity. It\u2019s a dream come true for Paul Ryan, speaker of the House, it sounds like. NANCY CORDES, CBS NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It really is and a dream that started far before he became speaker. And so when you\u2019ve got a big prize like this, many prizes they hope sitting on the table, you\u2019re willing to overlook a lot. So a lot of the things that you heard Paul Ryan criticizing Donald Trump for during the primaries, you won\u2019t hear over the next few months. He is going to try to stay as silent as possible. He needs Donald Trump and Donald Trump needs him. First thing right out of the gate, repealing Obamacare. Republicans will try to do that in the first few weeks of the new Congress. The big question becomes, what then? They know they want to replace it with something, but there\u2019s absolutely no consensus on what that something is. DICKERSON: David, let me ask you a question. One of the things Donald Trump promised and it seems Paul Ryan is going to help him achieve is a lot more military spending. What\u2019s the view inside of the military of that increased spending and this new commander in chief? DAVID MARTIN, CBS NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, of course, he first has to get out from under sequestration, which, I assume, the Republicans will do for him. DICKERSON: Those budget caps that limit the amount of spending on military. MARTIN: Budget. And once you get out from under that, they also want to increase the size of the military. If Donald Trump serves only one term, I\u2019m not sure there will be enough time for the military to get significantly larger in that period of time because it\u2019s not just a matter of bringing in more recruits, it\u2019s what kind of recruits. They don\u2019t need more riflemen. They need more cyber warfare experts and -- and things like that. DICKERSON: Jan, let me ask you, before -- I want to ask you about Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court, but first I want to ask you about, just, what does the court have coming up in this next year that -- are there big cases? JAN CRAWFORD, CBS NEWS CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: I mean the justices clearly decided to kind of take -- not take the year off, but certainly kind of avoid any major controversial cases. So this is a term that does not have the blockbuster cases that we\u2019ve seen in years past, whether Obamacare, same sex marriage, affirmative action. This is going to be a term that is focused across the street on the U.S. Senate and the confirmation of the next justice to replace, you know, conservative icons Justice Scalia. DICKERSON: And so what do you expect from that fight? CRAWFORD: Well, you know, Trump released a list before the election of -- of potential nominees that he would consider. And my sources say he is sticking to that list. They have narrowed it down to just a handful of highly qualified, very respective -- respected appellate court judges. I mean these are conservative legal rock stars. I mean this is not going to be a battle over qualifications. This will be a battle over ideology. DICKERSON: Any top names -- not to play this ridiculous game, but I\u2019ll start it there (ph). CRAWFORD: Yes. Yes. Yes, I mean I think -- no, no, no, because this is ongoing right now. This is something, to Major\u2019s point, they are going to move quickly on this. They\u2019re -- they\u2019re narrowing their focus on a handful, like I said, of appellate court judges. Bill Pryor from the Atlanta based Federal Appeals Court. Thomas Hardiman, a judge on the Philadelphia based Appeals Court. Steve Colloton, from out in Iowa upon the U.S. Court of Appeals, the Eighth Circuit. A judge, Diane Sykes, on the Seventh Circuit. And Joan Larsen, on the Michigan Supreme Court. But, again, all highly qualified. You -- you can\u2019t argue with their credentials. DICKERSON: Jeff, let me ask you about the FBI director. He had a pretty tough end of 2016. JEFF PEGUES, CBS NEWS HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: He certainly did. DICKERSON: What\u2019s the state of things inside the FBI and what about the director himself? PEGUES: Well, I think there\u2019s a lot of concern about what happens next. From what I\u2019m hearing, from sources and people who know James Comey, there has been no contact yet with President-elect Trump and so a lot of people are trying to see, where will this goes? Will he stay on or will he resign? Because, as you know, he is a lightning rod in Washington, D.C. right now. I think he has critics on both sides of the aisle. He may see that as a -- as a good place to be because he sees himself as above politics as the FBI director, but he\u2019s facing a lot of criticism. And not only from people on Capitol Hill, but also former agents who have questioned some of his tactics over the last six months. So he is really, and the FBI for that matter, is facing uncertain times right now. CORDES: And here\u2019s something very unusual. A lot of Democrats blame Jim Comey for Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss, but a lot of Democrats don\u2019t want him to leave either because they don\u2019t want to give Donald Trump license to be involved in choosing a new FBI director. It\u2019s a matte of the devil you know. DICKERSON: Margaret, let me ask you about President Obama, who you were covering at the end of his administration. We haven\u2019t had a situation since Woodrow Wilson lived in Washington D.C., as a president who comes out of offices, lives in Washington. What do you expect? MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, you won\u2019t have that dramatic exit in Marine One, where you just have to drive over to Calarama (ph) on January 20th. DICKERSON: Right. BRENNAN: But I -- DICKERSON: Take an Uber. BRENNAN: Exactly. So you\u2019re seeing the White House -- the president has said, I want to sort of coach in some ways the president-elect through this transition. Very sort of gently saying, look, he is an amateur, but saying, I\u2019m going to help him try to navigate this major bureaucracy that is the federal government. The Twitter account of the White House is now in federal records for all-time, and that Twitter account will become Donald Trump\u2019s on January 20th. That weight of those words is going to not only be amplified around the world, but sealed in our history. So how he starts to communicate once he takes that office is going to have profound effects. And I think that\u2019s something that certainly President Obama has tried to quietly suggest to him. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the -- the world that Donald Trump inherits, either through Donald Trump or through his secretary of state. What do you think the first things are that they have to do or they should do given the way the world is looking at the incoming Trump presidency? BRENNAN: Well, the diplomats that I talk to would tell you, you know, there are two things people hate, when it\u2019s financial markets or its foreign markets, and that\u2019s unpredictability. And right now what Donald Trump is suggesting is that the U.S. will be a source of insecurity, perhaps some uncertainty when it comes to decision making, that he\u2019s not going to lean on the coalitions, the NATOs, the U.N.s of the world, like President Obama has tried to emphasize. That he\u2019s going to have more of a transactional relationship with global leaders. The test of that is now you\u2019re going to have Rex Tillerson, a secretary of state who understands full well the weight of words because he moves global markets with them as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil. Can he play cleanup and really sort of work out some of those rough edges on the foreign policy front for Donald Trump. DICKERSON: And he ran on -- as an unpredictable. That was his selling point for Donald Trump. GARRETT: One of them. One of them. And it\u2019s important what Margaret brings up because if you want to understand Trump, I really recommend, and this is not to sell his book, but if you read \u201cArt of the Deal,\u201d you get a sense of who he is and what he became on the campaign trail. And one of the things he says very early on in that book is, I like to work the phones. I make 100 calls a day. I like to crack open conversations and see where they go. The China/Taiwan thing is a classic example of that. He wants to crack open that conversation, see where it goes. See what happens. Unsettled things, get on the phone and then see what happens and see where it leads. There is not an organizing structure to the foreign policy. Once you crack open a conversation, yes, you can make a new deal, but what are you in pursuit of. DICKERSON: Right. GARRETT: What are you trying to accomplish? DICKERSON: David, I want to get your take on also, what does the Pentagon worry most about in terms of threat from the world? MARTIN: Well, if you listen to what James Mattis, who we can assume, I think, is going to be the next secretary of defense says, the biggest short-term threat is Russia. The biggest long-term threat is China. And the biggest threat to stability in the Middle East is Iran. And that\u2019s not a particularly unconventional world view. I would think that most members of the Obama administration hold that -- that same view. I think where Mattis will differ from the Obama administration is, he believes in pushing back. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean going to war because he\u2019s also said many times that before you go to war, you\u2019ve got to think it all the way through and be sure you can sustain it. But I think it will mean more frequent and visible shows of force. We\u2019ve just had this incident where the Chinese stole that underwater drone from a Navy research vessel. The instant that happened, you knew in the Obama administration what was going to happen. They were going to play that as low-key as possible and keep it from being an irritant in the overall relationship. We\u2019ve got no idea what Donald Trump will do the -- the first time somebody makes off with a drone. I mean he tweeted, let them keep it. But as president, when somebody makes off with your sovereign property, he may have an entirely different point of view. DICKERSON: And how -- how worried are they about North Korea? MARTIN: I think North Korea is -- is the unanswered and so far unsolvable problem that the U.S. faces. Kim Jong-un seems to have made a strategic decision. He\u2019s going to get a nuclear arsenal no matter what the cost in economic sanctions. So it is only a matter of time before North Korea has a genuine capability to launch a nuclear weapon against the United States. The question is, is Donald Trump going to sit there and let that happen? DICKERSON: Jeff, let me ask you about Russia. We have this, at the end of 2016, the gap between the president, who is getting ready to retaliate against Russia for hacking and the president-elect who didn\u2019t even think that was a serious finding on the part of the intelligence agencies. When Donald Trump heard about the -- the hacking, he said, you know, remember these are the same people who thought there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Kind of a big shot at the intelligence agency he\u2019s going to have to work with. PEGUES: Yes. And I -- I think, within the intelligence community, that was a shot across the bow. I think there was a lot of concern about how the president-elect handled that, and how he will handle the intelligence community going forward. DICKERSON: Jan, let me ask you a question about the attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions. What changes should people be looking for in that area? CRAWFORD: He is someone who I think is -- is quite conservative and -- and believes strongly in the right position. By right I mean the conservative position, in terms of how you\u2019re going to run that Justice department. I think what\u2019s going to be very interesting, and we\u2019ll get an early kind of clue for how Democrats are going to react to some of these nominations, the outside groups are really beating Senator Sessions up right now over some of his past history. They\u2019re trying to make this kind of questions of race going back 30 and 40 years. The Democrats on the committee are going to try to focus on, to your point, how he will run that department, what it will mean for voting rights and immigration. Will he implement some of these hardline policies that\u2019s been suggested on the campaign trail. So that actually could have an impact on the Justice Department, unlike the Supreme Court, which, when you talk about change and -- and Trump, President-elect Trump coming in here and kind of upending Washington, you know, turning the tables upside down, he will not change the Supreme Court. Even if he nominates one of the -- the nominees that we\u2019ve been talking about, conservatives, strong conservatives, they will be -- that nominee will be replace a conservative icon, Justice Scalia. It will not change the balance of the Supreme Court, the direction of the Supreme Court at all. DICKERSON: I want to talk to you about that in a second and we\u2019ll get, Nancy, your thoughts about how the Democrats are going to respond to all of this in a second. But let\u2019s take a break and we\u2019ll do that and we\u2019ll be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we\u2019re back with more from our CBS correspondent round table. Nancy, I want to start with you, picking up on the point that Jan was making about what Democrats are going to do to resist the -- Mr. Trump\u2019s picks. What\u2019s your sense of how they\u2019re going to do it? Resist everything? Pick your shots? Is there one marquee battle to watch? CORDES: They\u2019re going to have to pick their battles because almost to a person, these nominees, Democrats believe are antithetical to the positions they intend to hold. They think, for example, that if you don\u2019t believe that the environment is in trouble, you shouldn\u2019t be running the EPA and on and on. However Democrats also want to be able to make a larger point, not just about this nominee or that nominee, but that in general they believe that the Trump administration is outside the mainstream. And if you\u2019ve got every Senate Democrat making that case against every single nominee, that message is going to get lost. So they will try to pick a few marquee nominees to really go after in public hearings to try to get a lot of attention. Beyond getting attention, it\u2019s not clear that there\u2019s much that they can do to stop any of these nominations and they know that because they simply don\u2019t have the numbers. DICKERSON: What are your quick thoughts on Chuck Schumer? Mitch McConnell famously told Major Garrett that he wanted to keep President Obama to being a one term president. Is that the way Chuck Schumer, as the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is positioning himself against Donald Trump or does he have another view? CORDES: I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s in his DNA. So there are some Democrats who would -- DICKERSON: To be obstructionist? CORDES: To -- to -- to be an obstructionist. DICKERSON: He wants to make a deal? CORDES: He likes to make a deal. Chuck Schumer does want to cut a deal, for instance, on infrastructure spending, even though there are going to be some in his own party who say, if you cut a deal with Donald Trump on that or anything else, you are going to send a message to the rest of the country that he is someone who can get things done, and we shouldn\u2019t allow that to happen. DICKERSON: David, let me ask you about terrorism, because it was talked about so much by Donald Trump in the campaign. He said he wanted a 30-day plan to take care of ISIS. What\u2019s your sense of where that battle stands when the president inherits it? MARTIN: Well, he\u2019s going to inherit a battle in which ISIS is just losing ground by the day. They\u2019ve lost half of the territory they once held in Iraq. And the battle of Mosul is going to be long and it\u2019s going to be ugly. But the city\u2019s surrounded. They\u2019re going to lose. So, geographically, ISIS is losing. But, of course, as everybody points out, it\u2019s the idea that you have to kill as well. You might get lucky, kill al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, and that will somehow collapse the whole impetus behind the movement, but I doubt it. DICKERSON: It\u2019s hard to kill an idea. MARTIN: Hard to kill an idea. So I think whatever Donald Trump inherits on the ground, the real battle is -- is going to be in the air for -- for the battle of ideas. DICKERSON: Margaret. PEGUES: And there -- there was a lot of concern, John, once they squeeze ISIS on the battlefield and al Qaeda on the battlefield, that they will -- the killers will then spread out across western Europe and maybe try to come here to the U.S. DICKERSON: Margaret. BRENNAN: And I\u2019d say the next question is, OK, so ISIS falls, then what happens on the day after? We\u2019ve heard the president-elect criticize the current president for leaving a vacuum in the Middle East, failure, that disappearing red line in Syria, the failure to prevent atrocities. So if you take out ISIS in Syria or in Iraq, how do you actually build up a government that can keep a functioning military this time, right? How do you prevent repeating the mistakes that they\u2019ve criticized the Obama administration for? I would say, watch really carefully what happens in Syria. That is going to be such a litmus test because of that articulation of American weakness there that Trump has hit Obama on. Does he choose to see this as a battlefield against Iran, which has strengthened its hold on the region and the Iranian-backed militias, or does he see this as a way to partner with the Russians, who have backed Iran, who have backed Assad, who are carrying out those atrocities that the U.S. calls a war crime. MARTIN: You know, the Obama administration has struggled mightily not to be distracted by anything in Syria other than the war against ISIS. Do not get involved in the civil war. And I -- I can\u2019t imagine that -- that General Mattis wouldn\u2019t have the same advice to President Trump. Whether or not President Trump follows that advice is another question. DICKERSON: Right. BRENNAN: But he also likely sees it as not a civil war anymore. It\u2019s a ground war with Iran. It\u2019s an air war with Russia. And if you want to solve some of the problems when you look at Europe, that refugee crisis, that flow of terrorists that Jeff was talking about, the beating heart of that is in Syria and you need to address that in some way. Maybe it\u2019s not the ground troops that President Obama said were the only answer and the one that he shut down, but he\u2019s got to do something. GARRETT: (INAUDIBLE) safe havens and you asked the regional allies for money and they say no, and it\u2019s not a real estate transaction, it\u2019s actually hardball geo politics with the Saudis and others, say, no, we\u2019re not going to pony up. You told all the people in America we would. Guess what, we wouldn\u2019t. DICKERSON: The safe havens that Donald Trump wants to create and have the Saudis pay for it. GARRETT: Exactly. MARTIN: Yes. GARRETT: And if that doesn\u2019t happen, then when -- then where are you left? You\u2019re back where the Obama administration has been struggling for six years. MARTIN: If it\u2019s safe haven, does that mean you\u2019re willing to shoot down a Russian aircraft? GARRETT: Right, to protect them? BRENNAN: Right. That\u2019s a bit of an art -- GARRETT: Even if they are paid for. BRENNAN: A form of art, too, because the -- the president and leaded into this idea of humanitarian corridors. That it\u2019s not even a no-fly zone, as we describe it. So there\u2019s some -- some mushiness here in terms of what that could actually mean. DICKERSON: Let me move on to our final round here, which is predictions for the year of 2017. Jeff, I\u2019m going to start with you. PEGUES: Oh, great. DICKERSON: I want to -- what -- give us a prediction about something that\u2019s going to happen in 2017 or a clever way to get out of the question. PEGUES: Well, listen, I -- I was struggling over this one because I -- I felt like, you know, I could go the easy you route and say something about ISIS, but I\u2019m going to go with a harder route and talk about James Comey, frankly, because, where will he be in January? I think he will be at the FBI. There are a lot of people in Washington who might disagree with that, but I have talked to sources who say that he -- he has spoken in groups of retired agents and he has -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019s been very comfortable there, and he\u2019s defended his decisions as something that he had to do given the cards that he was dealt. So I think he stays at the FBI. DICKERSON: He\u2019s comfortable with retired agents, but doesn\u2019t want to become one. Nancy, what\u2019s your prediction for 2017? CORDES: I think by the end of the year you will see a new Democratic organization that does not currently exist -- that does not currently exist, designed to try to reach some of these white working class voters that the Clinton administration -- the Clinton campaign wasn\u2019t able to reach in 2016. You\u2019ve got a number of high ranking Clinton campaign officials who thought they were going to spend the next four years, very busy, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, now looking for a new purpose. DICKERSON: David, what are your thoughts for 2017? MARTIN: Well, the bar is low because everybody\u2019s been so wrong all the time about -- about Donald Trump. I -- I will predict that he will meet personally with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, and attempt to cut a deal that would somehow at least freeze the North Korean nuclear weapons program. DICKERSON: Major? GARRETT: A year from now we will be writing about Vice President Mike Pence, the most important person in the Trump administration, because at every personnel level and every turn, he will have won more than he has lost. And whatever the ideology of President Trump is, the personnel implementing it will be at almost every vital turn selected, vetted and recommended by Mike Pence and, in more ways than Dick Cheney, a very powerful vice president. DICKERSON: All right, Jan Crawford, (INAUDIBLE). CRAWFORD: Well, I want going to stick with something that is much more predictable, and that is that Alabama is going to win the National Championship again for the (INAUDIBLE) time. (CROSS TALK) CRAWFORD: I mean that\u2019s something I think we can all say (INAUDIBLE). DICKERSON: Yes, the sun -- the sun rises, the sun sets, Alabama wins. These are -- CRAWFORD: Exactly. So, roll Tide. That\u2019s my prediction. And also, to -- is that good enough or do you want a serious one? We know that\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s really not much of a prediction. I think that the Supreme Court -- Supreme Court confirmation fight is going to be the biggest battle that we will see. I think it\u2019s going to be a place for Democrats to kind of put all their pent-up rage and frustration at what happened in November. You\u2019re going to see a real effort to block President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court. My prediction is that will fail. DICKERSON: All right, and, Margaret, your prediction for 2017? BRENNAN: No sleep for any of us for the entire year and frequent confrontations, small scale or otherwise, with both Iran pushing the limits of its nuclear program, and seeing if the Trump administration enforces it, and with North Korea, which is about scheduled for another test sometime soon. DICKERSON: A busy year. Thank you all for being here at the end. And that\u2019s it for our correspondents\u2019 roundtable. I want to thank all of you for being here and we\u2019ll be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: That\u2019s it for us today. Thank you for watching. We want to wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy Hanukkah. We\u2019ll be back here on New Year\u2019s Day for another special broadcast. We hope to see you then.

President-elect Donald Trump took a break from hiring to kick off a thank you tour in his favorite battleground state.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: I love this stuff. Can I go on with this just a little bit longer?  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  TRUMP: I love it.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: But is his time better spent getting prepared for his new job? We will ask the new White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and Trump adviser and former Speaker Newt Gingrich.  We will get a preview of Scott Pelley\u2019s interview with Speaker Paul Ryan for tonight\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d  And we will talk to another former speaker, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. She will be along to tell us how Democrats are preparing for the new administration.  Plus, former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta will also weigh in on what it takes to succeed in the Oval Office.  And, as always, political reporters give us their views on the week and what\u2019s to come.  It\u2019s all ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  President-elect Donald Trump made some key hires this week and shocked some members of the foreign policy establishment.  We begin this morning with the new White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who joins us from the RNC headquarters in Washington.  Let me ask you about the secretary of state pick. What\u2019s happening with that now?  REINCE PRIEBUS, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, there\u2019s going to be an announcement this week, and obviously we know it\u2019s going to be General Mattis. And what a hero, someone that I think all Americans can look to and say, we\u2019re going to be in great hands with this person that I think all Americans look up to, one of the most decorated Marines of our generation, and someone who has a strategic mind, someone that\u2019s going to lead our Defense Department, and someone that\u2019s going to clean up the Defense Department and help president-elect Trump shape his foreign policy.  DICKERSON: But what about the secretary of state job?  PRIEBUS: Well, that\u2019s a different story. Things are moving quickly.  I don\u2019t think anyone can accuse president-elect Trump of not moving fast. We are. Great picks. People are seeing a very smooth transition, but, look, that one is just taking a little bit longer, and I think it\u2019s just fine. Everything doesn\u2019t have to happen all at once. He\u2019s taking his time, making a smart decision, and we will see where that goes.  DICKERSON: And Kellyanne Conway said there would be a grassroots revolt if Donald Trump picked Mitt Romney. Do you agree with that?  PRIEBUS: Look, I think Governor Romney is very talented. And I think what really we should look at is that we have got a president here in Donald Trump that wants to look at the best and brightest of America, regardless of background, regardless of past disputes that we may have had with each other, that that is the past. That\u2019s the rear- view mirror.  We want the look through the front windshield. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing by talking to all of these different people. I think that the folks out there across the country, and I think they are, should be encouraged by a president that really wants to build trust and sort of in the team of rivals concept is something that I think is a good thing for America.  But that\u2019s where Donald Trump\u2019s mind is at. That\u2019s where his heart is at. That\u2019s a great thing for this country.  DICKERSON: Team of rivals, the title of Doris Kearns Goodwin\u2019s book about the Lincoln administration.  Let me ask you about the Trump style. There\u2019s this view among some I have talked to that he\u2019s most influenced by the person he talked to last. Do you agree with that?  PRIEBUS: No, I really don\u2019t.  I think that he what is, is he\u2019s someone that likes to listen to lots of different opinion, lots of different people, lots of smart people. He will talk to a lot of folks and just say, what do you think about this option? That\u2019s a good thing. But in the end, once he formulates his opinion, once he decides this is where we\u2019re going to go, he pulls the trigger and he moves. And that\u2019s why you see a lot of these Cabinet picks, they happen quickly, but what you don\u2019t see is that there are days and days and days of deliberation and communication and conversations that take place before those decisions are made, all great qualities in leading our country.  DICKERSON: You say he likes to take in a lot of information. He has not taken in as many intelligence briefings as previous president- elects. Why is that?  PRIEBUS: But he is. You know, they have daily briefings now.  DICKERSON: Is he getting them every day?  PRIEBUS: And obviously General Flynn and K.T. McFarland -- it\u2019s about every day. It\u2019s happening quite frequently, John.  And I think those are just going to ramp up as we get closer to January 20. But he is certainly informed. He\u2019s getting briefed. And it feels like every day. I\u2019m not sure if it is every day. But it\u2019s a lot. And that\u2019s who he is. It\u2019s someone who studies and someone that wants to be informed and it\u2019s someone who asks a lot of questions and listens.  DICKERSON: Is he a details guy?  PRIEBUS: He is a details guy.  You know, he is -- I would say it\u2019s he\u2019s a Socratic method guy. It kind of reminds me of being back in law school. He asks a lot of questions, asks questions about questions. And he will keep going until he\u2019s satisfied with the information that he\u2019s getting.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you, as the incoming chief of staff, what do you do when he says something like millions of voters voted illegally in California, when you know that that\u2019s not true?  PRIEBUS: Well, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s not true, John.  I saw there was an article in \u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u201d the other day, and it had a certain percentage of people that are voting that shouldn\u2019t be voting. There are estimates all over the map on that. Here\u2019s the problem. No one really knows.  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: But you think millions of people voted illegally?  PRIEBUS: It\u2019s possible.  DICKERSON: There is no evidence that it happened in millions of votes in California.  I guess is question is, when you\u2019re president, can you just offer a theory that has no evidence behind it, or does he have to tighten up his standard of proof?  PRIEBUS: I think he\u2019s done a great job. I think the president- elect is someone who has pushed the envelope and caused people to think in this country, has not taken conventional thought on every single issue.  And it\u2019s caused people to look at things that maybe they have taken for granted. You look at the flag-burning issue last week. This is an 80 percent issue. And then you watch the news media and they say, well, it\u2019s constitutional. Well, right, it is constitutional, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a subject for debate and discussion for the Supreme Court to revisit down the road.  So I think he -- I think that unconventional thought is something that has caused a revolution in this country, which is why I think President Trump is going to go down in history as a really great president.  DICKERSON: In the brief time we have left, he -- the president had a conversation with the -- the president-elect, I should say, had a conversation with the president of Taiwan. Did he believe that he was talking to the leader of a sovereign state in that conversation?  PRIEBUS: No, of course not.  He knew exactly what was happening. But, look, we have got a lot of problems to solve in this country, and we\u2019re not going to solve them by just making believe that people don\u2019t exist. This was a two- minute congratulatory call. He talked to President Xi over two weeks ago. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be willing to talk with him again.  This is not a massive deviation of our policy. But President Trump has made it clear that he\u2019s going to work with China, PRC, to make sure that we have a better deal, that we have better trade agreements, and that we do a better job in protecting the American worker. And he\u2019s going to continue to do it.  DICKERSON: So, courtesy call, not a change in policy?  PRIEBUS: Exactly.  DICKERSON: All right.  Reince Priebus, the incoming chief of staff, thanks so much for being with us.  PRIEBUS: You bet.  DICKERSON: Last week, Scott Pelley spent some time with Speaker Paul Ryan for tonight\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d  Ryan, whose relationship with Donald Trump during the campaign was rocky at best, told Scott he talks with the president-elect nearly every day and that he\u2019s confident the two will work well together.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We\u2019re fine. We\u2019re not looking back. We\u2019re looking forward. We actually -- like I said, we speak about every day. And it\u2019s not about looking forward -- back in the past. That\u2019s behind us. We\u2019re way beyond that.  Now we\u2019re talking about, how do we fix this country\u2019s problems, how do we hit the ground running? That\u2019s what I\u2019m excited about. What I\u2019m excited about in my virtually daily conversations with Donald Trump, it\u2019s all about how are we going to get things done, what goes first, what\u2019s the schedule, how do we get this done, how can we help people here?  It\u2019s really exciting to see. For a long time, we have been trying to get unified Republican government. We here in Congress spent all of 2015 getting ready and preparing for the possible opportunity of a unified Republican government. And now we have it, and it\u2019s very exciting. And those are the kinds of conversations we have on a virtually daily basis.  SCOTT PELLEY, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: I\u2019m curious, though, how did you patch it up? Who apologized to whom? How did that conversation go?  RYAN: It went fine. It was pretty much the day after the election or maybe two days after the election.  And we basically to let bygones by bygones and let\u2019s forward and fix this country\u2019s problems. And it was over and done with. And ever since then, we have had nothing but extremely productive conversations.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: For more of Scott Pelley\u2019s interview with Speaker Paul Ryan, tune into \u201c60 Minutes\u201d tonight at 7:00 p.m. Eastern.  Joining us now is former Speaker of the House and vice chair of the Trump transition team Newt Gingrich.  Mr. Speaker, John Kennedy said when he got into the White House, he said, \u201cI wish I had spent less time getting to know people who helped me get elected and more time with people who would help me be president.\u201d  Do you think Donald Trump is learning that?  NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Well, I think he\u2019s learning it.  But I would say of John F. Kennedy, with how narrow his election was, if he had spent more time with people telling him how to be president, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten through the election.  DICKERSON: First things first.  GINGRICH: So, first things first. And Trump pulled off one of the most amazing achievements in American history. Came out of nowhere. The only person not to have been a military officer or a public figure, a public elected official, only person in American history to win the presidency.  DICKERSON: When -- so Eisenhower having been a public figure...  GINGRICH: You have generals, General Grant, General Washington, General Eisenhower.  DICKERSON: You said that Donald Trump was saying that it\u2019s a bigger job than he thought. What does that mean?  GINGRICH: I think that particularly when he went to the White House and he was in the Oval Office, he was beginning to realize that, under our system, the full weight, for example, of national security is on one shoulder. It\u2019s not 50 people. It\u2019s the president, commander in chief.  The degree to which people around the country, much as what you saw with saving 1,100 jobs at Carrier, the degree to which people around the country look to the president to try to make their lives better, I think he suddenly realized -- somebody said it was like the old story of the dog that caught a bus.  And I said, no, this is like the dog that caught a convoy. There are so many ramifications. If you take, as he does, trying to truly move America into a different direction, then it is a remarkably important job and one that means he\u2019s got to build a real team. He can\u2019t possibly do it by himself. And he\u2019s showing that he understands that.  DICKERSON: You mentioned that it\u2019s all on one shoulder. That why it seems odd maybe that he\u2019s not starving for intelligence information, every day, wants the daily brief.  GINGRICH: I once had Secretary Rubin say to me as secretary of the treasury that during the financial crisis in Indonesia, he got more out of \u201cThe Financial Times\u201d each morning than out of the CIA, and that he just thought, you know, you have to be realistic about this.  I have no idea what the current intelligence briefings are like, and I\u2019m not denigrating them, but if you took the total number of foreign leaders that president-elect Trump has talked to in the last couple weeks, he\u2019s clearly engaged in the world. He\u2019s clearly talk -- he\u2019s getting advice from Merkel. He\u2019s getting advice from a wide range of leaders, from Abe in Japan.  At the same time, he\u2019s got several people he trusts. And I\u2019m assuming that Flynn and McFarland are, in fact, taking the briefings, and if they see something they think he needs to know, they will come tell him.  DICKERSON: You talked about the team around him. Incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus talked about the team of rivals, making the case there for Mitt Romney. You are not making the case for Mitt Romney. Why isn\u2019t that, though, a good team of rivals?  GINGRICH: Look, first of all, nobody in the Lincoln Cabinet actively opposed his election up to Election Day.  They were rivals until he got the nomination. And then they were all for him. So there\u2019s a -- Romney doesn\u2019t quite fit that pattern. But, second, I\u2019m very comfortable if, given the amount of time he\u2019s put into this, if president-elect Trump says, I want Romney, I\u2019m for Romney.  He has spent more than enough time talking with Mitt, and Mitt had a good occasion yesterday in accepting the call from Taiwan to understand that President Trump is going to be his own leader in foreign policy, and he\u2019s looking for somebody to be his secretary of state, not the State Department\u2019s.  If he concludes that Romney can do the job best, I\u2019m for Romney. What I\u2019m impressed with is the patient way he\u2019s gone about this. He didn\u2019t jump in for Romney. He didn\u2019t jump in against him. He hasn\u2019t jumped in for Giuliani. And I can say, as tough as I have been in public, which has been very aggressive, deliberately, about Mitt, I have gotten no blowback from anybody, including Reince.  There\u2019s a sense of you\u2019re allowed to have your own opinion. This is like \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d When you get to a decision, we will all be on the same team, but until that decision is made, it\u2019s a fair conversation.  DICKERSON: Speaking of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and TV and having opinions and expressing them there, is it -- which is more effective with Donald Trump, something you tell him in person or something you say on TV?  GINGRICH: As a general rule, something you tell him on person. On occasion, it helps to reinforce that on TV.  DICKERSON: Because it seems like some people, including Kellyanne Conway, who is former campaign manager, are sending him messages through the TV. Or maybe we have got that wrong.  GINGRICH: Or sometimes you\u2019re also communicating to the millions and millions of people.  I mean, Callista and I have been out doing book signings. We were at Williamsburg yesterday. People walk up to us routinely and say, I don\u2019t want Mitt.  Well, those people deserve to know there is a substantial positive part of the Trump operation that hears their concerns. That doesn\u2019t mean that in the end they shouldn\u2019t be for the president-elect when if he makes a decision for Romney. But they deserve to know that there are people hearing them.  DICKERSON: Yes.  On the Carrier action Donald Trump took, why is it the role of a president to negotiate? Wouldn\u2019t Republicans or conservatives have said traditionally say he\u2019s picking winners and losers, he\u2019s meddling in the free market? Why is that not what he\u2019s doing?  GINGRICH: Well, first of all, he\u2019s picking winners among Americans.  It\u2019s a very simple model. And 1,100 families are going to have a better Christmas. And all of the people around them are going to have a better Christmas. The local dry cleaner, the local grocery store are all going to have a better Christmas.  Now, you can ask the question, should the president-elect -- and I think it\u2019s amazing he did this before he got sworn in -- I mean, should the president-elect pick up the phone and call the CEO and say, you know, we want to change things? Give us a shot here. Let us try to fix this.  DICKERSON: No perverse incentives, though, to a company that now says, well, I can get $7 million in tax breaks if I just say I\u2019m going to go to Mexico?  GINGRICH: Well, they may.  Look, there are 50 governors who have worked overtime to get people to invest in their states. In the new world economy, maybe you better have a president who behaves like a governor, and says, hey, I\u2019m competing with Mexico and I\u2019m competing with China and I\u2019m competing with Germany. And I want that factory here. Now, what do I got to do to get that factory here?  DICKERSON: All right, Newt Gingrich, thanks so much for being with us.  And we will be back in a minute with one of the top Democrats in the House, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we\u2019re back with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.  Welcome, Leader Pelosi.  REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Good morning.  DICKERSON: What is it going to be like with Donald Trump as president? How are the Democrats going to react?  PELOSI: Well, we, first of all, respect the office that he holds and the people who elected him to the office. We will engage where we can, and we will oppose where we cannot.  A good example is how we worked with President George W. Bush when he was president. We opposed him on privatizing Social Security, the war in Iraq, but we worked with him on many, many other issues, including one of the biggest energy bills in history, issues that related to tax breaks for low-income people. The list goes on and on.  DICKERSON: What are some areas where you think you might be able to work with him?  PELOSI: Well, hopefully, we can work with him on infrastructure, building infrastructure of America in a way that increases the paychecks of American workers.  It won\u2019t be cooperation if, in fact, it\u2019s just a tax break for the wealthy disguised as an infrastructure bill. But let\u2019s hope for the best. Everything he has said I think is promising about how we can go forward. We can work with him on issues that relate to child care or early childhood education, the rest. He has said that would be important, and we have had a conversation about that.  DICKERSON: I want to ask you about early childhood. There was a report in the paper that when you talked to him about this, he handed the phone to his daughter.  PELOSI: Yes, he did, because it\u2019s a very high priority for her. I did not take that as something saying: That\u2019s not anything I\u2019m talking about. I took as: It\u2019s a priority for Ivanka; therefore, it\u2019s a priority for me.  DICKERSON: What do you think of the fact that his kids are kind of in and out of the administration and the business?  PELOSI: Well, I\u2019m not going to go to that place.  Where I would like to go is to say where we won\u2019t work with him is. And that is on privatization of Medicare and privatization of the VA. I think it\u2019s really important for the American people to know that part of -- central to the Ryan budget, Speaker Ryan budget, is the voucherizing of Medicare.  This would be a tremendous loss, taking away the guarantee of Medicare. In addition, over 10 years in that budget, it takes a trillion dollars out of Medicaid, two-thirds of which go for long-term health care for seniors. So seniors have a lot to lose in what the Republicans are proposing.  Interesting to see if President Trump will go along with that.  DICKERSON: What about Obamacare? He wants to take that on right away. Why wouldn\u2019t that be an initial big fight Democrats...  PELOSI: Well, it will be a big fight. And seniors should know how it affects them, because we extended the solvency of Medicare in that.  We gave free checkups, all of that, closed the doughnut hole, which increased prescription drugs to seniors. So seniors have a lot to lose, both in the voucherizing of Medicare, cutting of Medicaid and what it wants to do for the Affordable Care Act.  DICKERSON: The Democratic Party is in a moment of questioning about its identity. You were reelected to lead the Democrats in the House. What do you tell Democrats who want a new direction? And then go to you. What are you going to do differently?  PELOSI: Well, I don\u2019t think that people want a new direction. Our values unify us.  And our values are about supporting America\u2019s working families. That\u2019s one that everyone is in agreement on. What we want is a better connection of our message to working families in our country.  And that clearly in the election showed that that message wasn\u2019t coming through. But we are united in terms of the security of our country, which is our first responsibility, to be smart and strong and not reckless in how we protect the American people, strong in how we protect our economy.  DICKERSON: Here\u2019s my question, though. Democrats -- since 2008, the numbers are ghastly for Democrats. In the Senate, Democrats are down 10 percent, in the House, down 19.3 percent, and in governors, 35 percent. The Democrats are getting clobbered at every level over multiple elections. That seems like a real crisis for the party.  PELOSI: Well, you\u2019re forgetting that we were up 50 seats. We went up so high in 2006 and 2008. And let me just put that in perspective.  When President Clinton was elected, Republicans came in big in the next election. When President Bush was president, we came in big in the next election -- in subsequent elections. When President Obama became president, the Republicans came in big in the next election.  DICKERSON: I guess my question is, the Republicans reacted to their losses with a big revolution and a change. They have a very new president at the top of their party now.  You have somebody like Agricultural Secretary Tom Vilsack saying that the Democratic Party is like a tree that -- quote -- \u201clooks healthy on the outside, but is in the throes of a slow and long-term demise.\u201d  PELOSI: Well, I have enormous respect for the secretary, but I\u2019m more optimistic about the strength of the Democratic Party.  And what I would say, because you talked about these numbers, some reasons to be hopeful, because it\u2019s necessary, because this is about policy. It\u2019s not about politics. It\u2019s about politics for some, but, for us, it\u2019s about protecting Medicare, Social Security, good- paying jobs for America\u2019s workers, protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose, issues that unify us.  But let me just say this. In any time that a presidential -- the change in president from one party to the next, the states receive an infusion of talent. President Obama going out of the office, sadly, not having President Clinton come in, but those Democrats will go back, run for governor, run for Congress, state legislatures and the rest. And we will build up the numbers that you\u2019re talking about there.  DICKERSON: All right, we are going to have to leave it there, Leader Pelosi. Thank you. We look forward to having you back.  PELOSI: OK, but, anyway, upward and onward.  DICKERSON: Thank you.  And we will be right back.  PELOSI: Thank you.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We sat down with former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta just hours before president-elect Trump announced that retired Marine General James Mattis was his pick to head the Pentagon.  In order for Mattis to serve, Congress must change a law that states military officials must be out of the service for seven years prior to taking control of the Pentagon.  Mattis, who headed up Central Command, retired three-and-a-half years ago.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: Explain for people why the civilian control of the military is a tradition and why having a general is a good or a bad thing or just what kinds of things people should be thinking about.  LEON PANETTA, FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Well, you know, it goes back to George Washington.  There is a great portrait up at the Capitol of George Washington giving up his commission in the military in order to become president of the United States, which I think was a reflection of the fact that it\u2019s important to have civilian leadership and civilian perspective when it comes to those issues.  It doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t have a military background. I think that that is important, to have that background. But, at the same time, in those jobs, you have got to exercise the ability to understand political issues, to deal with broader issues that involve your capability to relate to the American people.  And so, yes, having a strong defense background is important, but it\u2019s also important to be able to have that ability to understand the civilian side of that job, because both are involved as secretary of defense.  DICKERSON: You have worked with James Mattis. What do you think about him?  PANETTA: I like Jim Mattis a lot. He was a -- he\u2019s a tough general, spoke the truth, was a good adviser. I trusted his defense judgment. And so I think he\u2019s got a lot of qualities that are important to secretary of defense job.  I do think that it\u2019s important for Congress to talk with him, if he is nominated, to make sure that he also understands the civilian perspective, because I think it\u2019s important to have that when you become secretary.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: We will have a lot more of our interview with former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta when we come back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Don\u2019t go away.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  We continue our interview with former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. We pick up with my asking him what he makes of Donald Trump.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  PANETTA: John, I think, like a lot of people, I\u2019m still trying to figure him out and try to figure out just exactly who we\u2019re going to have as the new president. He\u2019s very unconventional. And, you know, you\u2019re just not quite sure which Donald Trump is going to walk into the Oval Office. Whether it\u2019s the, you know, the reality TV-tweeting president, or whether it\u2019s the business president who will be serious- minded about approaching it. So it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s really difficult right now to try to get a sense of just exactly what the president- elect is going to be like.  DICKERSON: And what do you make of some of the picks that he\u2019s made for top positions? Do they give you any sense of what his administration might look like?  PANETTA: Well, you know, in many ways it reflex some of the positions obviously he took during the campaign. But at the same time, obviously he\u2019s talking to a lot of people. And I suspect he is probably, for the first time, getting a real sense of what the awesome responsibility of president is all about. And it just seems to me that in light of, that he\u2019s beginning to talk to a number of people that will bring some experience and some perspective that I think he\u2019s going to need if he\u2019s going to, you know, be able to deal with the multitude of crises he\u2019s going to be confronting.  DICKERSON: One of the thing I heard over and over again during the campaign is voters would say, he doesn\u2019t have Washington experience, but he\u2019ll be able to surround himself with advisers.  PANETTA: That\u2019s not good enough. The reality is, it is the president of the United States who has to make the final decision. And you can have a lot of bright people. They can present you a lot of options. But unless you\u2019ve taken the time as president to understand those issues, to read into those issues, to understand the consequences of those issues, you cannot just rely on others to tell you what you should or shouldn\u2019t do. You\u2019ve got to make the decision.  DICKERSON: So far Donald Trump has picked a lot of people who were already on his team. They call them loyalists inside the Trump campaign. What does that suggest to you in terms of this quality that people talk about with president, somebody needing to be able to go in there and tell them no? How important is that quality?  PANETTA: Well, you know, there\u2019s -- look, there\u2019s no question that loyalty is important. But, if you\u2019re going to be, you know, a top staff assistant to the president of the United States, you\u2019ve got to be willing to tell him the truth. You\u2019ve got to be willing to tell him when you think he\u2019s wrong and when he\u2019s taking the wrong step. I mean the biggest problem in the White House that I\u2019ve experienced is that everybody is trying to figure out what the president wants to hear and then tell the president what he wants to hear. And I suspect that, you know, a big personality like Donald Trump, you know, probably intimidates a lot of people who don\u2019t necessarily want to look him in the eye and tell him exactly what he may not want to hear. But I always felt my responsibility as chief of staff was to be the person who walked into the Oval Office and said to the president, you can\u2019t do that, or, this is wrong, and be able to tell him what you believe is the truth. And if you don\u2019t -- if you don\u2019t have that, that\u2019s -- that, I think, starts a president off on the wrong foot.  DICKERSON: Speaking of Congress and confirmations, what questions should members of Congress ask the director about taking over the CIA now?  PANETTA: I think the most important question is to ask whether or not you are willing to provide the most accurate and credible intelligence to the president of the United States, whether he like -- he wants to hear it or not. The role of the CIA director is to provide that kind of credible intelligence. That\u2019s the whole purpose of providing the so-called presidential daily brief. It\u2019s to inform the president of what\u2019s taking place in the world, what do we know about the world, what do we know about crises, what do we know about those that are trying to in some way threaten this country?  Frankly, one of the concerns I have right now is that this president is not getting his intelligence briefings. He\u2019s taken a few of them, but he\u2019s not getting them every day. If you\u2019re president of the United States, you better be in touch on a daily basis with your intelligence briefers so that you have an understanding as to what\u2019s happening in the world, what are the crises you have to pay attention to and what steps do you have to take in order to deal with those crises.  DICKERSON: Explain for people why a president couldn\u2019t check in with his intelligence briefers every once in a while and didn\u2019t need it every day?  PANETTA: It doesn\u2019t -- it doesn\u2019t work that way. You -- I mean you are constantly on the intelligence scale looking at a series of threats that may be out there. Some of them may be credible. Some may not be credible. But those threats change on a day-to-day basis with new intelligence, with new sources, with new assets that provide information. Every president I -- I know, and I\u2019ve worked under nine presidents, every one has taken their intelligence daily brief because that sets the agenda for what you have to focus on as president of the United States.  DICKERSON: The only job you haven\u2019t held, it seems, would be secretary of state, but Donald Trump is looking at a secretary of state. If you were giving him advice, giving all that you know, the nine presidents you served, people have been discussed are General Petraeus, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani. Assess that field in terms of what you know from your inside experience a secretary of state has to do.  PANETTA: For this president in particular, but it\u2019s probably true for every president, no matter how experienced they may be, you want to have a secretary of state that understands the world, understands the issues that are out there, has the ability to relate to other world leaders, has the ability to be able to implement diplomacy, to engage with others. But most importantly, has the ability to understand, how do you, on a diplomatic basis, approach the crises that a president of the United States has to deal with. You need to have a strong secretary of state because that person is your ambassador to the world. And without that, you are left without the information and without the ability to make the right decisions that have to be made in a complicated world.  We\u2019re dealing with a world that\u2019s very dangerous right now. Got a lot of -- a lot of flash points in this world. You need to have a secretary of state that understands those flash points and understands how to deal with our adversaries, but also how to deal with our allies.  DICKERSON: Do you think one of those hits that criteria?  PANETTA: My sense is that, you know, he -- I know he\u2019s talking to Mitt Romney. I think Romney would be able to fit that. I think there are others he\u2019s talking to that (INAUDIBLE) able to accomplish that as well. But I think the president needs to understand that if he\u2019s going to implement a strong foreign policy, if he\u2019s going to take care of our national security, a strong secretary of state is absolutely essential to your ability to protect this country and to advance our interests in the world.  DICKERSON: Leon Panetta, thanks so much for being here.  PANETTA: Thank you.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: And we\u2019ll be right back with our panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We\u2019re back now with our Sunday politics panel. Susan Page is \u201cUSA Today\u2019s\u201d Washington bureau chief. Reihan Salam is the executive editor of \u201cThe National Review.\u201d Audie Cornish is host of \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d at NPR. And Dan Balz is chief correspondent at \u201cThe Washington Post.\u201d  Reihan, I want the start with you.  What have we learned about Donald Trump from the people he\u2019s picked?  REIHAN SALAM, \u201cNATIONAL REVIEW\u201d: Well, we\u2019ve learned that he\u2019s drawing on a very broad array of people ranging from loyalists to a lot of Republican regulars. I found the pick of Elaine Chao as secretary of transportation to be a particularly telling (ph). Elaine Chao is not someone who is an old school Donald Trump loyalist, yet she is someone who had served in cabinets before as secretary of labor and she is, of course, also the wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. So that is a sign that, hey, maybe transportation is indeed a very high priority and he is thinking about legislative strategy. At the other end of the spectrum, you know, you have the designate for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who distinguished himself by being an early staunch supporter and someone who\u2019s really shaped Donald Trump\u2019s views on immigration policy. So I\u2019d say that, you know, those are two ends of the spectrum, a loyalist and also someone who is going to be facilitating Trump\u2019s ostensible future role as a deal maker.  DICKERSON: Dan, do you think we have an administration shaping up where Donald Trump does out and dos what he did with the Carrier deal, has a big flashy moment and leaves the details to other people? Or what do we know in terms of -- or can we know even at this part -- at this point about the kind of separation of duties between Donald Trump and the people he picks to head these departments or even his vice president?  DAN BALZ, \u201cWASHINGTON POST\u201d: John, I think there\u2019s still a lot we won\u2019t know until he\u2019s actually in power. We\u2019ve -- we are beginning to see some signs of it. And I think in -- in -- certainly in the -- terms of the cabinet picks and the kinds of things he\u2019s done, there\u2019s the two Donald Trumps, some of which we saw during the campaign. There\u2019s the Donald Trump, on the one hand, who is unpredictability, who likes to mix it up, who wants to stir the pot, who will continue to tweet things that will upset people. And we also saw at certain times in the campaign, and we\u2019re seeing in this selection of the cabinet, a Donald Trump who in some ways comes off as a generic Republican. And I think that that\u2019s going to be the tension within a Trump administration, which is the more significant, who\u2019s really running things, is he really running it or is he being guided by others, particularly those that are sort of in the Republican mainstream. My guess is that Donald Trump will continue to try to shake things up.  DICKERSON: Susan, Newt Gingrich, who\u2019s been a critic of Mitt Romney for secretary of state, seemed to be, in our conversation with him today, maybe OK about Mitt Romney being secretary of state. What do you make of that post in particular? It\u2019s taken longer. There\u2019s been this public conversation about it. Some -- sometimes it seems like messages are coming to Donald Trump from his staff through the televisions. What do you think is going on there?  SUSAN PAGE, \u201cUSA TODAY\u201d: I think it\u2019s interesting and not surprising that he\u2019s taking a little time with secretary of state. No more important appointment that he\u2019ll make. And you see the competition between a loyalist, somebody who was with him, Rudy Giuliani, and his fiercest critic, Mitt Romney.  I do think that there are signs that they are looking for maybe some additional names. And one name I\u2019ve heard is John Huntsman, the former ambassador to China for Barack Obama, a guy who ran for president himself not so successfully for the Republican ticket. But someone who was not -- never part of never Trump movement, has some foreign policy experience. So I wonder if they\u2019re having maybe the standoff between Giuliani and Romney has created an opening for a third person to walk through, whether it be Huntsman or Bob Corker or someone else.  DICKERSON: Audie, one question I wondered about was, I asked Reince Priebus about this (INAUDIBLE) millions of votes being cast in California, and the reason I asked is, there\u2019s no evidence of that and yet Priebus was in the position of basically defending his boss in that case. But going to Dan\u2019s point about the two different Donald Trumps. What -- what -- how does this -- how does the presidency accommodate this? When the president said things --  AUDIE CORNISH, NPR: I thought the point about the two different Trumps was interesting because the Trump I\u2019m seeing most is like the one we know from \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d I mean like the cabinet process feels like a reality show. You\u2019ve got these people traipsing in and out. In fact, it\u2019s more like \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d Like somebody\u2019s going to get a rose. You have that photo of Romney at that romantically lit dinner which like -- looked very awkward. And at the end of the day, somebody is going to get tapped.  But one question is, if you take a position with the Trump administration, how much say do you have? Like, right? Will you be listened to? Will you be respected? What are the ramifications if you decide you can\u2019t do it anymore and what to resign or want to step aside? I think anybody who wanted the State Department job, for instance, and saw what happened with Taiwan in the last, you know, week is probably thinking, what does it mean to take this gig?  PAGE: You know what struck me, though, in the months since the election is, you know that civil war that I and others predicted in the Republican Party? That isn\u2019t happening. This is Donald Trump\u2019s party --  CORNISH: Yes, I heard bygones be bygones.  DICKERSON: Well, that -- yes, victory -- victory tends to make everybody -- (CROSS TALK)  PAGE: So you have -- so -- and -- and Donald Trump has actually been pretty split I think in both rewarding loyalty with some but not with everybody. Giuliani still doesn\u2019t have a job. Forgive -- not forgiving everybody maybe, but forgiving some of the people who were pretty critical of him during the campaign. This is Donald Trump\u2019s party. This is Donald Trump\u2019s administration. And while he\u2019s somebody that we can see already is willing to delegate, especially to Mike Pence -- Mike Pence has emerged as a really powerful figure -- this is his administration.  SALAM: To offer a somewhat different perspective, I think about this through the lens of the past. So if you think about Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, here were two figures who in a lot of ways were very unconventional Democrats. Jimmy Carter ran really in opposition to the Democratic Party in lots of ways. He was a very idiosyncratic figure. And actually his Democratic coalition was very different from the Democratic coalition that emerged in later years. And he struggled as president. He was a, you know, governor from Georgia who came in without the support of the congressional Democratic Party. So that was kind of a disaster, at least some would say.  If you look at Bill Clinton, it was a very different situation. Bill Clinton ran as a populist, as a new Democrat. The trouble is that there were no new Democrats. There were no actual cadres. There were maybe 15, 20, 30 people. So he could not actually staff his administration with people who represented his particular world view. He wound up staffing it with some retreads from the Carter administration, and a lot of fairly conventional liberals and then there was a fight in the party, but basically he wound up being a populist Democrat, but you could say a bit of a Wall Street Democrat. It was Robert Rubin who defined the Clinton presidency.  So, similarly with Trump, you can imagine a scenario in which, like Jimmy Carter, her kind of fights tooth and nail against his party. You can imagine another scenario in which he essentially gets assimilated to the kind of power brokers of his party. And then maybe there\u2019s a third case, but the problem with the third case in which he advances his distinctive nationalism and populism, the problem with that third case is that you need cadres. You need actual trumpists in order for that to happen. And maybe Steve Bannon is a trumpists. Maybe there are a handful of other people who are trumpists, but it\u2019s not really clear that he has the people to staff those 4,000 jobs in his administration to advance that distinctive perspective. So I see the Clinton scenario or the Carter scenario as the two things at work right now.  DICKERSON: Unless his perspective is whatever works at the time, and then everybody\u2019s just trying to get a result and that\u2019s not a specific result.  SALAM: Well, and that\u2019s -- yes, and that could be, OK, that you\u2019re just giving to the power brokers in the party.  DICKERSON: Well, let me ask you, Audie, about this deal that Donald Trump worked with -- with Carrier this week. He said he was going to punish them, but they got $7 million in tax breaks. What did you make of this at the end of the day?  CORNISH: I think it\u2019s interesting that Trump has rejected the kind of check list that Republicans have. I think, Dan, you\u2019ve written about this, like him being kind of independent and therefore he doesn\u2019t have to do the like free market. Can\u2019t do that, right? So all of a sudden, that\u2019s OK. And I think maybe we could see or I think the thing I\u2019ll be looking for is, will that change the atmosphere for corporate decision making. If you have a president who is not constricted by all of those kind of party dynamics, that creates some uncertainty and who knows kind of how they could take that going forward.  DICKERSON: What do you think, Dan, about -- is -- are we going to see Donald Trump basically -- is this the model for his presidency, these kinds of high-profile, hands-on, but in a limited way?  BALZ: Well, Donald Trump is a showman.  DICKERSON: Yes.  BALZ: And he likes to create these moments. And we\u2019ve seen him do it throughout the campaign. And I can\u2019t imagine that given his age and his experience that he\u2019s going to fundamentally change the way he approaches this new job, even though it\u2019s totally different than anything he\u2019s done.  I think on the issue of the -- of the Carrier case, the question is, what signals does that send outside of that particular episode? Is it -- is it incentives to other companies to try to come in and bargain with him? Does it create some sense of intimidation that the president of the United States is going to call you out if he sees you doing something that he doesn\u2019t like? I think that everybody is going to be making judgments based on a handful of symbolic but real things that he does early on in his tenure, and they will begin to calibrate how they deal with him from there.  SALAM: It\u2019s fascinating to see the opposition because, on the one hand, you have Larry Summers, very prominent Democrat, who\u2019s saying that, hey, this isn\u2019t the rule of law. This is isn\u2019t a free market. And, of course, he never mentions that -- people said this same thing about the auto bailout, right?  DICKERSON: Right.  SALAM: And then you have Bernie Sanders saying, this isn\u2019t punitive enough, this isn\u2019t hard enough on the corporations. It\u2019s just a huge giveaway. So which is it going to be? And I think that in that is room for maneuver for Trump.  PAGE: (INAUDIBLE) --  DICKERSON: Right, and you have Sarah Palin calling it crony capitalism.  SALAM: Right.  DICKERSON: So you have it (INAUDIBLE).  PAGE: There\u2019s no ideological test for Donald Trump. He is not an ideological guy. He is whatever the result is. Maybe it\u2019s whatever looks good. I mean and that gives him, it seems to me, tremendous sway and probably a great deal of irritation for other Republicans in Washington.  DICKERSON: All right, we\u2019re going to cut it there for a moment and we\u2019ll be right back.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: (INAUDIBLE) from politics panel, Audie, I want to ask you about Nancy Pelosi, who was here, the Democratic leader, re- elected as a Democratic leader. She said she respects the office of the presidency. A lot of Democrats I talked to don\u2019t, you know, they say, not my president. They want a tougher fighting against Donald Trump. How do you think that get worked out?  CORNISH: I think that\u2019s why she is back as leader, right? I mean basically there are lawmakers in that caucus who said, we want somebody who is prepared to do the legislative battling we need to run defense for the next two years. And she knows how to do that. I know that that was looked at purely through the lens of like election and what does this mean for the whole party going forward. But I actually think some of that was about just like, what is our defense going to be against this unified Republican government, and therefore Donald Trump?  DICKERSON: But, Susan, what do Democrats do when they\u2019re looking for their new, vibrant voice of rescue that\u2019s going to keep this from being a coastal party that keeps losing in those percentages I talked about?  PAGE: I think Democrats are in just in a world of hurt at the moment and they\u2019ve reduced (INAUDIBLE) tactic. Their one piece play -- piece of leverage is the Senate filibuster. That doesn\u2019t say much for a party if you\u2019ve lost the White House, the House, the Senate. You\u2019re going to have a Supreme Court that\u2019s going to be less friendly. You\u2019ve lost all these state legislature, which may be the most serious thing. Democrats face a world in which they\u2019ve been hallowed out. They have not -- they have not had people in the pipeline move up as Republicans have so scurvily done that for the past 20 years. So they need to address not only the geography of their party, but also building back lower ranks of their party, state legislature, statewide elected officials, so you have more possibilities to move into the top ranks.  DICKERSON: One of the ways, Dan, that this is a -- showing itself, the combat era, the conversation in the Democratic Party is in looking back at the Clinton campaign and the way it was run. You were a part, as Susan was, of the Harvard campaign managers, where the managers for all the campaigns get together. There was a real crash between the Trump forces and the Clintons. What happened and what does it -- what does it mean, not so much what happened, but what -- does it mean anything larger?  BALZ: Well, I think it means that this -- this -- this campaign has left this country in such a -- kind of a raw state of emotion about the outcome. The outcome was a surprise I think on -- a big surprise on both sides, I think it\u2019s fair to say. And the -- the -- the Clinton team reflecting both the sort of sense of devastation had -- had some things they wanted to put out on the table, critical of the way Donald Trump ran the campaign.  The Trump campaign, I think, because perhaps that they have -- you know, they didn\u2019t get the popular vote, they think they are not getting the respect that he deserves for having won a campaign that almost nobody said he could win. And so their -- neither side seems to be really prepared to make the real steps to try to bring about reconciliation. People said this at -- the day after the election, Donald Trump did, Hillary Clinton did, the president of the United States did, all said, you know, the right words. But underneath that, you\u2019ve got a country that\u2019s still roiled by this. There\u2019s lots of people nervous. There are lots of -- there\u2019s lots of resentments and grievances ono both sides and that -- that afternoon session at Harvard on Thursday afternoon, it just boiled over.  PAGE: And, of course, you\u2019re too modest to say, you were the moderator of that session. You said afterward that you needed a fire extinguisher. And the question is, what is there that could happen that could put out these fires that are really still raging even a month after the election?  DICKERSON: Explain, Susan, what the fire is to people who weren\u2019t there. I mean what\u2019s the -- is the central nature of it?  PAGE: Well, the -- I think on the one hand, the Trump people still pretty resentful about a lack of respect, as Dan said. And the -- the Clinton people arguing that they won by appealing to the darkest forces in American politics. And that was the ignition point for the fiercest exchanges that they had. But this -- you know, this -- we\u2019ve gone to these -- these forums before where it\u2019s not like they\u2019re friendly and love each other. It\u2019s that they\u2019re pretty civil to each other and that sense of civility was not apparent really on either side.  SALAM: To get us back to the Democrats for a moment, I\u2019ll just say that there is a fire (INAUDIBLE). And there\u2019s a process through which the Democratic Party is always learning and relearning certain lessons. The big thing is that the Democratic Party is the big city party. It\u2019s the urban party. That is a huge advantage in some respects. It means that you have resources. It means that you have lots of cultural capital, as well. But the tricky thing is that our political system is stacked against an urban party. When you want to win seats in the House of Representatives, and forget about the Senate, you need to be able to win some suburban, rural voters, instead of just stacking up all of your (INAUDIBLE) in big cities. That\u2019s just a fundamental challenge. And so what Nancy Pelosi managed to do, what Howard Dean and other folks managed to do, is, let\u2019s find Democrats who can win in these rural districts. Let\u2019s manage to do that. The thing is that the fire in the party is that urban fire of moving the party away from that. Hillary Clinton cosponsored legislation to punish flag burning with a year in prison in 2005. That was --  DICKERSON: Although Donald Trump wants to punish people for it too.  SALAM: Exactly.  DICKERSON: But we\u2019ll have to end it there. Thanks to all of you.  We\u2019ll be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: For us.

            "article_content": "Congress will be swamped next year with a heavy agenda, and while Republicans have a clear advantage, given their majority control of the White House and Congress, Democrats will still be able to block some of their goals.  Starting off, the new legislative session will be consumed by the Senate\u2019s process to confirm President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s appointments to his cabinet. It may a little rougher for some nominees, like Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, who has been selected as attorney general. Sessions\u2019 1986 nomination to a federal judgeship was rejected by a GOP-controlled Senate over allegations of racism. In the month after the inauguration, the new president and GOP leaders will have to focus on some pressing issues in addition to getting to work on some of the 2016 campaign promises.  Since the Senate requires 60 votes to advance legislation, Democrats, though in the minority, will still be able to block some proposals by relying on the filibuster. Here are some of the major fights to come in the new Congress: House Republicans in the lame-duck session have already opted to extend government spending from early December through next March. If President Obama and Democrats agree to the short-term extension next month, that means GOP leaders and Trump will have the opportunity to get started on shifting around allocations as they work to keep the government funded through September.  There\u2019s just one catch. While conservatives have previously lobbied for defunding Obamacare and Planned Parenthood, Democrats could use the filibuster to block the majority from cutting spending to these and other major domestic programs, and they can also block the GOP from implementing controversial policy provisions. At the same time, a standoff between Democrats and Republicans could lead to the threat of a government shutdown in March -- with more to come.  Another issue that will come up in March is the debt ceiling, which has been\u00a0suspended through March 15. Beyond that date, the Treasury Department\u2019s so-called \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d will likely kick in and push back the deadline to lift the limit until the fall.  Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and many Republicans are no fans of raising the debt ceiling, and it\u2019s unclear where Trump stands on the issue. When Congress had to raise the limit last year, he told Bloomberg TV it was \u201cworth the fight\u201d for GOP lawmakers to threaten to not raise the debt limit because they could pressure the Obama administration for spending cuts.  Mr. Trump will be able to nominate a Supreme Court justice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia who died in  February. President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the bench, but Republicans refused to consider him. During the campaign in May and September,\u00a0Trump released two short lists of potential justices, which included Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a close ally of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who Trump has met with since becoming the president-elect. The justice would need Democratic support in order to overcome the 60-vote hurdle in the confirmation process. Schumer was asked Sunday if Cruz would be too conservative for the high court. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into specific candidates. But we\u2019d hope it would be mainstream. If it is mainstream, you have to remember, the last four nominees, two from President Bush, two from President Obama, got bipartisan support on the bench. If he doesn\u2019t nominate a mainstream candidate, we\u2019re going to go at him with everything we have,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Republicans aim to immediately start work on an Obamacare repeal. \u00a0A full repeal would require Democratic support, so it\u2019s more likely they\u2019ll pursue a partial repeal using an obscure budget process called reconciliation, which would only require 51 votes for passage instead of a supermajority of 60. Democrats, therefore, won\u2019t be able to stop this one.  Last January, after months of negotiations among Republicans in the House and Senate, they sent an Obamacare repeal using reconciliation to Mr. Obama\u2019s desk, which he vetoed. The measure would have repealed the health-care law\u2019s tax hikes, insurance exchange subsidies and the Medicaid expansion. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the plan would lead to 22 million people losing their healthcare insurance.  Since it likely will take a while for Republicans to coalesce around a replacement plan, it\u2019s possible Republicans might try to delay the repeal from taking effect until they have the new plan ready. Trump told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d just days after the election that Republicans would \u201cdo it simultaneously.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have, like, a two-day period and we\u2019re not going to have a two-year period where there\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said when asked if people would lose their coverage.  In addition, Trump said during the campaign that no changes should be made to some entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. But Ryan suggested to Fox News last week that Medicare might be something Republicans target as they debate Obamacare. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t realize is that Medicare is going broke, that Medicare is going to have price controls, so you have to deal with those issues if you\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Vice President-elect Mike Pence told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in a recent interview that in addition to an Obamacare repeal, the legislative session will be dominated by \u201ctax reform, rebuilding the military, infrastructure [and] ending illegal immigration.\u201d Republicans are discussing crafting a second reconciliation bill to reform the tax code -- a plan that has already been endorsed by the GOP chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees.  Trump campaigned on cutting income taxes and taxes for corporations. He also advocated closing the carried interest loophole that allows managers of hedge funds and private equity firms to pay a lower tax rate. Also up for changes -- the estate tax, which Mr. Trump promised to eliminate, and childcare, which would be tax-deductible (there are already tax credits in place for childcare, but Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals would expand benefits). In the early 2000s, President George W. Bush was able to implement his sweeping tax cuts with the help of congressional Republicans who used reconciliation.  Again, Democrats would not be able to halt this effort with the filibuster.  Trump has, since the election, indicated that the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border may not be all-wall after all, suggesting that fencing \u201cfor certain areas\u201d could be acceptable, he told CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d It\u2019s unclear where and when Congress would step in. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would make Mexico pay for the wall by threatening to cut off billions of dollars in money transfers that Mexicans who are living in the U.S. send home. He wouldn\u2019t cut off the money transfers if Mexico agrees to make a one-time payment: \u201cIt\u2019s an easy decision for Mexico: make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year,\u201d said a campaign memo. In an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Ryan said Republicans are \u201cfocused on securing the border...We think that\u2019s first and foremost before we get into any other immigration issue. We\u2019ve got to know who\u2019s coming and going in the country.\u201d Democrats, however, would likely be needed for any sort immigration measure because they could block it in the Senate.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to help him build his wall,\u201d incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d  Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that he would get rid of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. That means Congress would need to roll back the law that they passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis.  Democrats can stop Trump here, too, again using the filibuster.  \u201cWe are not going to roll back Dodd-Frank,\u201d Schumer said in the interview Sunday. \u201cI think they should forget about that. We have 60 votes to block them.\u201d Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "4:40 p.m. ET Is there anything you can do to reassure the undocumented immigrants who have received deferred deportations under DACA about living under a Trump administration and shield their information from the next administration? Is now the time to test the theory that you can move the rest of the detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay? \u201cI will urge the president-elect and the upcoming admin to think long and hard before they are endangering the status for all practical purposes are american kids. These are kids who were brought here by their presidents. They did nothing wrong. They\u2019ve pledged allegiance to the flag,\u201d Obama said.\u00a0 \u201cIt is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see those kids to start hiding again,\u201d he added. On Gitmo, Obama said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that i have not been able to close the darn thing because of the congressional restrictions placed on us.\u201d\u00a0 He said his administration has been able to reduce the population to less than 100 detainees. He said the U.S. would be much better off closing the facility and moving them to a different facility governed by a U.S. jurisdiction, which he said would be cheaper. The president said he\u2019ll continue to explore other options. 4:26 p.m. ET Do you have concerns about a Trump administration altering the Iran nuclear deal? Are you willing to let Aleppo fall under your watch? What do you think of Trump saying he won\u2019t support the Syrian opposition? Obama said that after a robust debate over the Iran deal, there is now \u201cover a year of evidence that they have abided by the agreement...that\u2019s the opinion of Israeli military intelligence officers.\u201d\u00a0 If the U.S. pulls out of the deal, which was negotiated with five other countries, the U.S. would then have to start sanctioning other countries. \u201cIt becomes more difficult to undo something that\u2019s working than undo something that isn\u2019t working,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not responsible for it, I think you can call it a terrible deal. When you are responsible for it, you\u2019re more likely to look at the facts.\u201d In Benghazi, there was a U.N. security resolution, Obama said, to prevent people in the city from being slaughtered. He added that Syria is more complicated and Secretary of State John Kerry has tried to work with allies to stop the killings there.\u00a0 \u201cThe situation is obviously different,\u201d he said, adding that they\u2019ll try to continue pursuing a political solution and humanitarian safe spaces. 4:21 p.m. ET Do you have any concern about Trump\u2019s temperament? \u201cWhatever you bring to this office, this office has a habit of magnifying and pointing out and hopefully then you correct for it,\u201d Obama said.\u00a0 He said a silly example for him is he hasn\u2019t been able to keep track of paper.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not well-organized in that way,\u201d he said, adding that he realized he has \u201cbad filing, sorting and organizing habits\u201d and had to find people who could help keep track of his papers. 4:12 p.m. ET Did anything surprise you about your meeting with Trump and do you have any concerns about a Trump presidency? \u201cWe have a very cordial conversation,\u201d Obama said about his meeting with Trump at the White House last Thursday. \u201cThat didn\u2019t surprise me to some degree...he is obviously a gregarious person...he likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate.\u201d\u00a0 The president added that he doesn\u2019t think Trump is \u201cideological\u201d but is \u201cultimately pragmatic and that can serve him well.\u201d \u201cDo I have concerns? Absolutely,\u201d Obama said. \u201cOf course I\u2019ve got concerns. He and I differ on a while bunch of different issues.\u201d\u00a0 Obama said one of their biggest differences is where they stand on Obamacare, which he said has been \u201cthe holy grail for Republicans over the last six to seven years.\u201d\u00a0 The president argued that people who have health insurance are benefitting from the law and asked what would happen if Republicans successfully repeal the program. \u201cWhat happens to those 20 million people who have health insurance?\u201d Obama said.\u00a0 Obama said that if the GOP comes up with something better that works in which 25 million people receive health insurance and it\u2019s cheaper and runs more smoothly, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be the first one to say, that\u2019s great, congratulations.\u201d\u00a0 He said if their response results in millions of people losing their healthcare coverage, he said there will be major problems. 4:07 p.m. ET What choice do you think the American people made last week and will there be a \u201ccourse correction\u201d before Europeans make their choices in their elections? \u201cI think the American people recognize that the world has shrunk -- that it\u2019s interconnected, that you\u2019re not going to put that genie back in the bottle,\u201d Obama said.\u00a0 The president said that the election reflected, \u201cPeople wanting that course correction that you described and the message around stopping surges of immigration, not creating new trade deals that may be unfair -- those were themes that played a prominent role in the campaign.\u201d Obama said that the most important strategy for progressives is to argue that people\u2019s concerns are real and that the solutions are a higher minimum wage, strong worker protections, stronger financial regulations and trade that ensures that countries that trade with the U.S. don\u2019t engage in child labor and attentiveness to inequality. 3:59 p.m. ET Obama, you didn\u2019t think Trump would ever be elected president. Is he qualified to be president and what do you think of his staffing and the tone of it like his appointment of alt-right leader Steve Bannon as Trump\u2019s chief strategist in the White House? \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the president-elect keeps making,\u201d Obama said.\u00a0 \u201cThe people have spoken,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will be up to him to set up a team to serve him well and reflect his policies...Those who didn\u2019t vote for him have to realize that\u2019s how democracy works.\u201d The president said that Trump needs to take time to think through what his practical out of his campaign promises and what he can actually achieve. \u201cI did say to him as I said publicly that because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaign that it\u2019s really important for us to send some signals of unity,\u201d Obama said. Asked again if he thinks Trump is qualified, Obama said, \u201cThis office has a way of waking you up.\u201d 3:50 p.m. ET Is there a learning curve to be president and how long did it take you? Did you discuss this matter with the president-elect? Obama joked, \u201cAbout a week ago, I started feeling pretty good.\u201d Then he got serious. \u201cI think the learning curve always continues,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a remarkable job. It\u2019s like no other job on earth. It\u2019s like a constant flow of issues.\u201d The president said he emphasized to Trump it\u2019s important how he staffs his White House, especially the chief of staff, White House counsel and national security adviser.\u00a0 Trump has announced that Reince Priebus will be his chief of staff and Steve Bannon will be his chief strategist. Obama said he\u2019s been \u201cencouraged\u201d by Trump\u2019s remarks after the the election. He added that he didn\u2019t really \u201cfeel at ease\u201d ever because he started as president when the economy tanked between 2008 and 2009. 3:43 p.m.\u00a0ET What will you say to other world leaders about your successor? And as Democrats scramble to regroup, what is your advice about where the party should go and who should lead it? Obama said that the influence of the U.S. in the world is not just the result of the president, but also the result of the relationships between the U.S. military and others abroad as well as diplomats, intelligence officers and development workers. \u201cThere\u2019s enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news,\u201d he said.\u00a0 The president said that during his meeting with Trump last week, the president-elect, \u201cexpressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,\u201d Obama said.\u00a0 \u201cOne of my messages that I\u2019ll be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the Trans-Atlantic Alliance,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Obama said it\u2019s \u201chealthy\u201d for Democrats to reflect on their loss in the 2016 election. 3:40 p.m. ET Obama said that he and first lady Michelle Obama want to offer their \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the family of journalist Gwen Ifill and her colleagues in the media. Ifill died Monday at the age of 61. 3:37 p.m. ET Obama said that he\u2019ll take a few questions on domestic issues before he goes on his final trip abroad as president.\u00a0 \u201cMy team stands ready to accerelate in the next steps that are required to ensure a snooth transition\u201d to a Donald Trump administration, Obama said.\u00a0 The president said he\u2019ll stay in touch with Trump while he travels overseas. He emphasized all of the progress that has been achieved under the Obama administration over the last eight years. 3:03 p.m. ET President-elect Trump met with President Obama last Thursday at the White House for a 90-minute meeting. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Mr. Obama plans to spend more time with his successor than presidents normally do. 3:00 p.m. ET AP: WASHINGTON -- It was supposed to be his grand valedictory tour. Now President Barack Obama must use his last major trip abroad to try to calm shocked world leaders about the outcome of the U.S. election, and what comes next when Donald Trump is president. Trump\u2019s unforeseen victory has triggered pangs of uncertainty at home and grave concerns around the world. Though Obama has urged unity and said the U.S. must root for Trump\u2019s success, the president\u2019s trip to Greece, Germany and Peru forces him to confront global concerns about the future of America\u2019s leadership. Obama departs Monday on the six-day trip. Before leaving the U.S., Obama faces reporters at an afternoon White House news conference, with questions about the presidential election and its consequences for U.S. policy and Obama\u2019s own legacy certain to be a focus. On his trip, Obama is stopping first in Athens, where he\u2019ll tour the Parthenon, meet with the prime minister, and give a speech about democracy and globalization that will take on new relevance in light of Trump\u2019s election. He\u2019ll use his visit to Berlin to show gratitude to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, his closest foreign partner, and to meet with key European leaders. In Peru, he\u2019ll attend a major Asian economic summit in Lima, and also meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Australian Prime Minster Malcolm Turnbull.

            "article_content": "During his first television interview as president-elect, Donald Trump sat down with \u201c60 Minutes\u2019\u201d Lesley Stahl and revealed more of his thinking on several important topics. From new details on his plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to addressing concerns about his stance on same-sex marriage, the future president shed light on what he plans to do about some of the promises he made during the campaign. Stahl said she noticed \u201cquite a change\u201d in the president-elect compared to an interview she held with him earlier this year, when he was still just a candidate. \u201cHe was much more subdued, much more serious\u201d this time around, Stahl said. \u201cI really did have the feeling that the sense of gravity, and how big the problems are \u2014 it was sinking in, washing over him,\u201d she says. \u201cI think he wanted the public to know that he understood that he had to shift gears and pay attention to the responsibilities now.\u201d Here are 7 things we learned from Trump during his interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d: One of the first things on President-elect Trump\u2019s agenda is to replace the late\u00a0Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia with a conservative judge.\u00a0 On Sunday\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Stahl asked Trump if that meant he was looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump responded: \u201cThey\u2019ll be pro-life, they\u2019ll be \u2014 in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody\u2019s talking about the Second Amendment and they\u2019re trying to dice it up and change it, they\u2019re going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and \u2014\u201d \u201cYeah, but then some women won\u2019t be able to get an abortion?\u201d Stahl asked. \u201cNo, it\u2019ll go back to the states,\u201d Trump replied. And if some states ban it? \u201cYeah, well, they\u2019ll perhaps have to go \u2014 they\u2019ll have to go to another state,\u201d Trump said. One of Trump\u2019s signature pledges throughout his campaign has been to build a border wall between Mexico and the United States. In fact, he\u2019s been promising it since Day 1. \u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words,\u201d said Trump when he first announced his candidacy\u00a0in June 2015. So, will Trump follow through with his grand plan? \u201cYes,\u201d he vowed again on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d he plans to build a wall \u2014 or at least a fence. \u201cI\u2019m very good at this, it\u2019s called construction,\u201d Trump told Stahl. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress. Would you accept a fence?\u201d Stahl asked. \u201cYeah, it could be \u2013 it could be some fencing,\u201d Trump replied. The LGBTQ community has no reason to fear a Trump presidency, the president-elect assured Stahl, and the American people, on Sunday\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d The billionaire businessman says he\u2019s always been a \u201csupporter.\u201d Stahl brought up a specific issue of concern for many people in the LGBTQ community: marriage equality. \u201cWell, I guess the issue for them is marriage equality. Do you support marriage equality?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt \u2014 it\u2019s irrelevant because it was already settled. It\u2019s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it\u2019s done,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo even if you appoint a judge that \u2014 \u201d Stahl prodded.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s done. It \u2014 you have \u2014 these cases have gone to the Supreme Court,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been settled. And, I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d Trump supporters roared with cheers as he\u00a0threatened to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and her private email server during the second presidential debate in October. \u201cIf I win, I\u2019m going to instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there\u2019s never been so many lies, so much deception,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law of our country,\u201d Clinton snapped back. \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail,\u201d Trump said. But days after being elected the 45th president, Trump\u2019s tone appears to have changed. When Stahl asked Trump on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d whether he\u2019d follow through on that particular threat, the president-elect was undecided.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cUm, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on health care, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we\u2019ve been talking about.\u201d \u201cYou called her \u2018Crooked Hillary,\u2019 said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, \u2018Lock em\u2019 up,\u2019\u201d Stahl reminded Trump. \u201cShe did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things...,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt them. I don\u2019t want to hurt them. They\u2019re, they\u2019re good people. I don\u2019t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do \u201860 Minutes\u2019\u00a0together.\u201d Health care is a \u201ctough situation,\u201d admitted Trump while discussing his plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with Stahl on Sunday. The president-elect says even though he wants to get rid of Obamacare, he will make sure people with pre-existing conditions are still covered. And he says he\u2019ll \u201ctry\u201d to keep coverage for \u201cchildren living with their parents for an extended period.\u201d (They can currently stay on their parents\u2019 plan till age 26.) \u201cAdds cost, but it\u2019s very much something we\u2019re going to try and keep,\u201d Trump said. The president-elect told Stahl that there won\u2019t ever be a period during the restructuring where millions of people could lose coverage. \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to do it simultaneously. It\u2019ll be just fine. We\u2019re not going to have, like, a two-day period and we\u2019re not going to have a two-year period where there\u2019s nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. And we\u2019ll know. And it\u2019ll be great health care for much less money. So it\u2019ll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination,\u201d Trump said. Donald Trump said he\u2019s \u201csaddened\u201d to hear about acts of violence carried out in his name either by his supporters or targeting his supporters. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d days after the election, Trump directly addressed those who would resort to violence, telling them, \u201cStop it.\u201d He told Stahl that he hadn\u2019t heard about\u00a0reports of racial slurs or personal threats\u00a0by his supporters targeting African-Americans, Latinos and gays. But he promised that he\u2019s going to bring the country together. \u201cI am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \u2018Stop it.\u2019 If it \u2014 if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it,\u201d Trump said. After\u00a0Trump\u2019s victory\u00a0last week, questions began to circulate about what would happen to his business empire and income when the business mogul becomes president.\u00a0 On Sunday, Trump told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he wouldn\u2019t take a salary as president. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve never commented on this, but the answer is no,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think I have to by law take $1, so I\u2019ll take $1 a year.\u201d Stahl reminded the president-elect, \u201c[That\u2019s] $400,000 you\u2019re giving up.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not gonna take the salary. I\u2019m not taking it,\u201d Trump said. Trump also said he doesn\u2019t expect to be \u201cvery big on vacations\u201d as president either. From the very beginning, Trump has promised that he\u2019d set businesses concerns aside if he was elected, although his children would continue to run his company. He\u00a0promised last year that he would refuse to take a salary as president, too. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019m going to do is tell you that if I\u2019m elected president, I\u2019m accepting no salary, OK?\u201d Trump said at a rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, in October. \u201cThat\u2019s not a big deal for me.\u201d",

            "article_content": "SAN DIEGO -- A newsletter from a San Diego Catholic church has warned parishioners they\u2019ll go to hell if they vote for Democrats. The San Diego Union-Tribune says a flier inserted in the Oct. 16 bulletin of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church called voting Democratic a mortal sin. It cited five policies - including support for abortion and same-sex marriage - that will doom supporters to eternal damnation. On Oct. 30, the bulletin itself took a Hillary Clinton quote out of context to claim she\u2019s influenced by Satan. It also criticized immigration policies and gun control. The church doubles as an election polling site. The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego said Wednesday that the messages don\u2019t reflect Catholic teaching and are inappropriate. The diocese says people should vote their consciences. \u201cBy descending into endorsing one party or another or suggesting outlandishly that if you vote for one party you\u2019ll go to hell is just flat out wrong,\u201d spokesman Kevin Eckery told CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB-TV.",

            "article_content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The Los Angeles Police Department says it will not change its immigration policies, despite pledges by President-elect Donald Trump to toughen the nation\u2019s immigration laws and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. \u201cWe\u2019re going to maintain the same posture we always have,\u201d LAPD Chief Charlie Beck told CBS Los Angeles. \u201cWe don\u2019t make detentions or arrests based solely on status, whether that\u2019s immigration status or any other status.\u201d \u201cIf the federal government takes a more aggressive role on deportation, then they\u2019ll have to do that on their own,\u201d Beck continued. Beck reiterated his commitment to maintaining LAPD policy to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI don\u2019t intend on doing anything different,\u201d Beck told the Times. \u201cWe are not going to engage in law enforcement activities solely based on somebody\u2019s immigration status. We are not going to work in conjunction with Homeland Security on deportation efforts. That is not our job, nor will I make it our job.\u201d The LAPD has a policy known as Special Order 40 that bars officers from initiating contact with anyone for the sole purpose of determining if they are in the country illegally. It has been in place since 1979. In recent years, the department has also stopped referring low-level arrestees to federal immigration authorities for possible deportation. The question of local police checking the immigration status of the people they interact with came to a head in 2012 after a judge ruled Arizona\u2019s controversial \u201cshow me your papers\u201d provision was legal. Five states -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah -- have adopted variations on Arizona\u2019s law. Proponents of the measure say it is a necessary part of police work. Opponents say it makes it harder for police to do their job because immigrants will be less likely to cooperate and report crimes against themselves and others. Trump made immigration a major issue during his presidential campaign, saying he would build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and round up people living in the country illegally and deport them. Trump told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday night that he plans to deport between 2 and 3 million immigrants. Those pledges have sparked concerns among immigrant communities in the days since Trump was elected, and contributed to protests that have been held across the country over the past week. According to The Times, Mayor Eric Garcetti echoed Beck\u2019s immigration stance on Friday while speaking to members of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, telling the group Special Order 40 will remain in place. \u201cOur law enforcement officers and LAPD don\u2019t go around asking people for their papers, nor should they,\u201d Garcetti said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the role of local law enforcement.\u201d Beck told The Times members of his command staff have been meeting with community leaders to discuss concerns over immigration enforcement. \u201cThis is the same LAPD you had Monday, a week ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not changed because of the election on Tuesday. We have the same principles. We have the same values. This is not going to change the way that the Los Angeles Police Department enforces the law.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "PHOENIX -\u00a0\u00a0An Arizona sheriff who became a national political figure by cracking down on illegal immigration and jailing inmates in tents lost Tuesday after 24 years in office, eliminating the last vestige of the state\u2019s decade-old movement of local police confronting people in the country illegally.  Voters booted Sheriff Joe Arpaio in favor of Democrat Paul Penzone, a retired Phoenix police sergeant who criticized the 84-year-old lawman for focusing too much on promoting himself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Toughest Sheriff\u201d and too little on improving public safety.  His loss came as mounting legal problems in a years-old racial profiling case led to a criminal charge two weeks before Election Day. Arpaio was charged with contempt of court for ignoring a judge\u2019s order to stop traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. He could face jail time if convicted.  Critics have slammed Arpaio for racking up $130 million in taxpayer-funded legal costs to defend him in lawsuits, including $48 million that has been spent so far on the profiling case.  The sheriff earned high marks from voters early in his tenure by jailing prisoners in tents in the desert heat and dressing them in pink underwear. His popularity has waned over the past few elections, but a devoted base of supporters and impressive campaign fundraising have helped him pull out wins.  The sheriff raised $12.3 million, most of it from people living in other states who supported his past immigration crackdowns. The movement lost steam after immigrant-smuggling traffic into Arizona declined and several state immigration laws were thrown out by the courts.  Other major politicians who anchored the movement have either been ousted or decided not to run for public office again.  But anti-immigration rhetoric from Donald Trump energized the state\u2019s conservative base and gave the Republican sheriff an ally. Arpaio introduced the GOP nominee at rallies and gave a speech at the national convention.  Over the last four years, the courts have stripped Arpaio of his power to conduct immigration crackdowns. His officers were found to have profiled Latinos in traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.  The sheriff, who acknowledged the contempt violations but insists they were unintentional, has pleaded not guilty to the charge. If convicted, he would face up to six months in jail.  His plan of attack against Penzone, who lost to the sheriff in 2012, consisted mostly of TV ads that claimed Penzone assaulted his wife in a 2003 dispute. The Democrat denies the claim and sued Arpaio, alleging defamation.\u00a0 Penzone has raised $1 million and gotten a boost from $2.9 million in campaign mailers and commercials from an anti-Arpaio group funded largely by liberal hedge-fund tycoon George Soros.  Like Penzone, the Soros-funded group has attacked Arpaio for botching investigations into hundreds of sex-crime cases.  Karen Cooney, a retiree in Phoenix who described herself as a conservative-leaning Democrat, said she voted for Penzone. She said she disliked signs that Arpaio posted on sheriff\u2019s vehicles asking people to report immigrants to the authorities.  \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s race was a no-brainer because I have only been here a few short years and I just do not agree with Arpaio\u2019s means and methods,\u201d Cooney said.  Crystal Burge, a homemaker from Phoenix, said she voted for Arpaio because of his tough jail policies, including his complex of jail tents.  \u201cI really like his philosophy on the outdoor jails,\u201d Burge said.",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK - Immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, but were protected from deportation by President Barack Obama, are being warned by some advocates to make sure they are not traveling abroad when Donald Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20. Some advocates, lawyers and universities are concerned that Trump might immediately rescind the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, an Obama program that had allowed these young immigrants to work and travel for humanitarian, educational or employment purposes. That could lead, they fear, to some people traveling abroad being barred from re-entering the U.S. \u201cWe are recommending all travel be completed by or before Jan. 20 in the event laws or procedures experience a drastic change,\u201d said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to expose them to an uncertain situation should they not be allowed back to the U.S.\u201d Mr. Trump made illegal immigration the cornerstone of his campaign, promising to build a wall along the Mexican border and deport millions of people living in the country illegally. His actual plans, though, have yet to be revealed. Recently, Mr. Trump has said he wants to focus on people who have committed crimes. During a recent Time magazine interview, Trump expressed sympathy for the 741,000 people in Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which started in 2012. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud,\u201d President-elect Trump said. \u201cThey got brought here at a very young age, they\u2019ve worked here, they\u2019ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they\u2019re in never-never land because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Complicating matters, the president-elect\u2019s advisers worked to walk back his comments almost as soon as they were published, with one transition aide demanding anonymity to deny that Trump intended to set any new policy. \u00a0 Advocates are still being cautious. Nancy Lopez-Ramirez, a 20-year-old student born in Mexico who is planning a trip there as part of a City College of New York class, said she is glad the group is returning by Jan. 15. \u201cMy mom is like \u2018I am concerned with you not coming back, I want you to be able to come back,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt is nerve-wracking but I think that at the end it is going to be worth it,\u201d said the political-science student, who was brought to the U.S. when she was 4. City College, part of the City University of New York, is one of the institutions advising students in the DACA program to return before Inauguration Day. So is California State University, which told administrators to tell participants in the program \u201cthat if they are outside of the United States as of January 20, 2017, there is no assurance they will be allowed to return to the U.S.\u201d Mr. Trump can rescind the promised protection right away through an \u201coperational memo\u201d because Obama implemented it through one, said William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. He said the program\u2019s participants should not consider traveling overseas unless they absolutely need to. U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Anthony Bucci said his agency \u201ccannot speculate\u201d when he was asked how long would it take for CBP officers to deny entry to the U.S. to program participants if Trump eliminated the protection. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services records said that as of Dec. 31, 2015, about 22,340 people in the DACA program were approved for the \u201cparole\u201d that allows them to travel outside the U.S. Trump called the program an \u201cillegal amnesty\u201d during his campaign. Tatyana Kleyn, an associate professor at City College who organized the upcoming Mexico trip, said interest in it actually surged among students after the presidential election. \u201cSo right now our bus fits 18 and we are bringing 20,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like a last chance.\u201d",

            "article_content": "PHOENIX - Sheriff Joe Arpaio grabbed headlines and became a national political figure with his unorthodox and divisive approach to policing - jailing inmates in tents, making them wear pink underwear, leading crackdowns on illegal immigration and investigating President Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate. Last Tuesday\u2019s defeat of the longtime sheriff of metro Phoenix raises questions about whether his successor, Paul Penzone, will keep the contentious practices and how he will overhaul an agency that has been criticized for targeting immigrants, creating a culture of cruelty in its jails and serving as self-promotion for Arpaio. The retired Phoenix police sergeant will take office in January amid national uncertainty over the status of immigrants and fear within the Latino community since Donald Trump won the presidency. Penzone said he will cut off Arpaio\u2019s investigation into Obama\u2019s birth certificate and eliminate practices that he regards as Arpaio publicity stunts. But he is interested in keeping some of Arpaio\u2019s signature methods, such as using posse volunteers who help out in sheriff\u2019s operations to free up officers for police work. Here are some of the challenges that Penzone faces when he takes office: Early in his two-decade tenure, Arpaio became popular with voters for jailing inmates in outdoor military tents amid Phoenix\u2019s triple-digit summer heat, making them wear pink underwear and using them to work on old-time chain gangs. The tough conditions appealed to those who believed, as he did, that jail should not be comfortable. Penzone said he will eliminate the pink underwear, which he calls a ploy lacking value to taxpayers. \u201cThat\u2019s the sheriff\u2019s brand,\u201d Penzone said of Arpaio. \u201cThat\u2019s not about law enforcement.\u201d He said he is willing to close the Tent City jail but is reserving judgment until he can make a full evaluation. Penzone plans to dramatically scale back the chain gangs by only using them in places such as parks. Penzone has no plans to restart the immigration crackdowns that made Arpaio a key figure in the country\u2019s border debate. Even if the incoming sheriff wanted to bring them back, the courts have barred the agency from immigration enforcement. Still, Penzone will be living with that legacy from Arpaio for years. Arpaio dragged his feet in complying with court orders to stop the patrols that a judge determined racially profiled Latinos, increasing the costs to taxpayers. The financial hemorrhaging is likely to continue until the sheriff\u2019s office comes in full compliance for three straight years. The case also led to a criminal contempt-of-court charge for Arpaio two weeks for Election Day, and he still faces possible jail time if convicted. Penzone said ending court oversight of the agency and controlling taxpayer costs are his priorities. The case is projected to cost taxpayers $72 million by next summer. After a court order, the sheriff\u2019s office is overhauling its internal investigations into officer misconduct. The judge in the profiling case said Arpaio\u2019s internal investigations were fraught with biased decision-making and had been manipulated to shield officials from accountability. The judge has ordered new investigations into allegations that Arpaio\u2019s officers regularly pocketed items in traffic stops and safe-house busts. The agency\u2019s former head of internal affairs is under federal investigation on suspicion of concealing nearly 1,500 IDs. Perhaps the most difficult challenge Penzone faces is restoring the Latino community\u2019s trust in the sheriff\u2019s office. The relationship was damaged by the dozens of Arpaio\u2019s immigration crackdowns over the years, leading some Latinos who witnessed crimes to avoid cooperating with police. The incoming sheriff said he will rebuild trust by establishing a culture of professionalism, meeting expectations on how the agency should operate and relieving taxpayers of their unnecessary financial burdens from the racial profiling case. Penzone said he was not worried about a backlash if he reverses Arpaio\u2019s policies. \u201cYou can be efficient, you can be ethical, you can be professional and still be strong on crime,\u201d he said. Arpaio said he doesn\u2019t mind if Penzone decides to undo his signature practices. The voters made a decision and he will accept it. \u201cIf someone else wants a change, it doesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d Arpaio said.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s promises have run the gamut from building a wall at the southern border to returning manufacturing jobs to Americans. Many of them can\u2019t be fulfilled quickly, if ever. But some can be dispatched with expediency as he gets ready to take office just\u00a0 Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump made promises about things he\u2019ll do in the first days of his presidency. Many of those -- like building a wall on the southern border or returning manufacturing jobs to Americans -- can\u2019t be done quickly, if ever. But some of his promises can be fulfilled relatively quickly.\u00a0 Here are a few things Trump can do in the first days of his presidency: At the top of that list is naming a Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia in February. Trump has released\u00a0twenty-one names of potential Supreme Court picks\u00a0-- all conservative. He\u2019d maintain the balance of the court, and with three justices 78 years of age or older, he\u2019s likely to solidify the conservative composition on the court. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be 83 years old by the time Trump is sworn in; Bill Clinton appointee Justice Stephen Breyer will be 78, and Justice Anthony Kennedy will turn 80 next year.\u00a0 Naming a justice is one thing. Confirmation is another. Although the Senate remains in Republican hands after the election, it does not have a filibuster-proof majority, and what\u2019s not clear is whether Democrats will try to block whomever Trump nominates. A couple of Senate Republicans, including Ted Cruz, had threatened before the election that if Hillary Clinton won, they would advocate blocking any Supreme Court nominee for the duration of her presidency.\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday told Republicans that they shouldn\u2019t expect to hold their majorities forever and warned of the danger of \u201coverreaching,\u201d which may be an indication that he wouldn\u2019t support doing away with the filibuster if necessary to get President-Elect Trump\u2019s nominees on the bench. Trump\u2019s transition team is undoubtedly studying President Obama\u2019s executive actions. President Obama, facing a Republican Congress for much of his presidency, relied heavily on executive actions to advance his agenda -- particularly on immigration and on climate change. In his 10-point immigration plan, Trump promised to \u201cimmediately terminate President Obama\u2019s two illegal executive amnesties,\u201d which targets for immediate rollbacks Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). The latter, \u00a0DAPA, would have deferred deportation for as many as five million undocumented immigrants, and it would have allowed them to work the U.S.\u00a0 DAPA was immediately challenged by the attorneys general of 26 states, and a Texas court placed a nationwide injunction on the program while the legal challenge proceeded through the courts.\u00a0The Supreme Court, by deadlocking in a 4-4 tie in the legal challenge on DAPA, effectively upheld the lower court\u2019s decision, which was merely a nationwide injunction putting the program on hold while the legal challenge against DAPA -- carried out by Texas and 26 states -- is heard in Texas. \u00a0 The 2010 DACA executive action, however, is not under legal challenge. Under that program, undocumented immigrants who entered the country before they turned 16 and before 2007 are eligible for renewable two-year work permits. Over half a million undocumented immigrants had participated in the program, as of June 2014. This is a fairly simple policy to undo, since it\u2019s technically an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, \u00a0notes Sarah Trumble, the deputy social policy director at the think tank Third Way. Trumble said that Trump can simply say he wants to reverse the policy. Trumble also said that Mr. Obama\u2019s simple executive orders \u201ccan be repealed with the stroke of a pen.\u201d The more difficult orders to undo are regulations that are in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Trump said in September that he would be \u201cscrapping the EPA\u2019s so-called Clean Power Plan,\u201d which demands power companies cut their greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA wrote the regulation and published it in the CFR December 2015, but there are court challenges from over two dozen states, and the Supreme Court blocked the rule\u2019s implementation until the legal fights have been resolved.\u00a0 And the president-elect has said he\u2019d \u201ccancel the Paris Climate Agreement.\u201d But the agreement is not legally binding, so Trump could conceivably just ignore it.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "\u00a0By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto  Just under half of Americans -- 46 percent -- are excited or optimistic about the presidency of Donald Trump, and just over half are either concerned (31 percent) or scared (22 percent) about what Mr. Trump will do as president. A new CBS News poll shows what the optimists are most excited about and what most worries those who are concerned or scared about Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 Thirty-six percent of Americans who are at least optimistic about a Trump presidency volunteer an improved economy or bringing back jobs as the thing they are most excited or optimistic about, by far the top choice. \u00a0Other reasons for optimism are the prospect of deporting illegal immigrants (5 percent), making America great again (4 percent), the way Mr. Trump will handle foreign policy (4 percent), bringing change to Washington, (4 percent), and getting rid of Obamacare (4 percent). For those concerned with the prospect of a Trump presidency, Mr. Trump\u2019s potential handling of foreign policy and the prospect of starting an international incident or getting the U.S. involved in a war is the top worry (22 percent), followed by his immigration policy 8 percent), his overall temperament and personality (6 percent), that he\u2019ll hurt the economy and job creation (6 percent), bigotry (6 percent), and his lack of qualifications and experience (5 percent). Amidst concerns from segments of the intelligence community about the role Russia may have played in the 2016 presidential campaign, more than a third of Americans think Donald Trump will be too friendly toward Russia when he becomes president. \u00a0Just 9 percent think he will be too hostile, while nearly half \u2013 48 percent - think his approach will be about right. \u00a0Views are largely partisan: \u00a0eight in 10 Republicans think his approach will be about right and six in 10 Democrats think he will be too friendly toward Russia. In comparison, 32 percent of Americans think Mr. Trump will be too hostile toward China, while just 9 percent think he will be too friendly. \u00a0Here again, half think his approach will be about right. Majorities are confident in Donald Trump\u2019s ability to handle some of the most important issues facing the nation: 61 percent are very or somewhat confident in how he will manage the economy, and 55 percent are confident in how he will deal with the threat of terrorism. About half are confident in his ability to make the right decisions about illegal immigration and foreign policy. Views are highly partisan; roughly nine in ten Republicans are confident in how the president-elect will manage the economy, terrorism, illegal immigration and foreign policy, while most Democrats are not confident. Americans are divided as to whether incidents of racial harassment have become more frequent since Donald Trump won the presidency \u2013 48 percent say they have, 44 percent say there isn\u2019t much difference. But four in five agree that now that he has been elected president, Mr. Trump has a responsibility to condemn incidents of racial harassment that might occur. Democrats (66 percent) are far more likely than Republicans (25 percent) to say such incidents have become more frequent. Majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents agree that now that he has been elected president, Mr. Trump has the responsibility to condemn these events. Fifty-eight percent of Americans think that the way Mr. Trump conducted his campaign has encouraged racial division; 29 percent think that has had no effect. Views are highly partisan. The poll finds mixed views of other specific qualities for the president-elect. Fifty-two percent say Mr. Trump does not share their priorities. Forty-five percent think he will make the U.S. image in the world worse, while 36 percent expect him to improve it. \u00a0There is more agreement about his leadership: six in ten think he has strong leadership qualities. \u00a0Republicans hold much more positive views of Mr. Trump than Democrats. Overall, just over a third of Americans \u2013 36 percent - say the election of Donald Trump as president makes them feel proud. \u00a0Partisanship affects views: most Republicans feel proud (70 percent), while most Democrats (87 percent) and independents (58 percent) do not. Overall opinion of Donald Trump remains more negative than positive, though fewer registered voters view him unfavorably than did so right before the election, and more are now saying they are undecided at this point. \u00a0Vice President-elect Mike Pence is viewed more favorably than unfavorably, though more than a third are undecided. After Donald Trump is sworn in as president, the Republican Party will control both the executive and legislative branches of government. Asked, in general, whether it is better to have the president and Congress from the same or different parties, Americans have a slight preference for control of both branches by the same party. But as has been the case historically, pragmatism trumps principle here: most Republicans now support same-party control, while Democrats prefer the presidency and Congress be controlled by different parties. \u00a0During Mr. Obama\u2019s second term - when Congress was under Republican control - Republicans wanted the White House and the Congress to be controlled by different parties. Majorities of Americans describe both major political parties as divided, not united. More view the Republican party as divided --partly because their own rank and file see the party that way. Democrats, despite losing the presidency and their failure to take control of Congress, are more likely to describe their political party as united than Republicans are to say that about theirs. Half of Americans now say that, compared to how they have treated other candidates, the news media has been harder in its treatment of Donald Trump. That is up from 40 percent of registered voters in June, before Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee. Republicans are especially likely to say the media has been harder on their candidate. Few Americans report having a great deal of trust and confidence in the news media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly; just 11 percent say they do. Half have not much or no confidence in the news media; that rises to 68 percent of Republicans.  President-elect Trump recently announced that the company Carrier would keep hundreds of jobs in the U.S. instead of moving them to Mexico in exchange for financial incentives. \u00a0More than two in three Americans \u2013 69 percent -- including majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents \u2013 favor a general policy that would provide tax breaks to companies that agree to keep U.S. manufacturing jobs from moving overseas. Twenty-seven percent oppose providing those tax breaks. Forty-eight percent think that trade with other countries loses more jobs for the U.S., while 29 percent think it creates jobs. Republicans have said that among the first things they will do after Donald Trump takes office next month is to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u00a0Now, 45 percent approve of the 2010 health care law, and 50 percent disapprove. Still, just one in ten think the ACA is working well and should be left as it is. Sixty-three percent think there are some good things in the law, but changes are needed, and 25 percent want the law repealed altogether. The percentage that supports repealing the law is down 10 points since January. Donald Trump\u2019s choice for head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, is skeptical that climate change is occurring. \u00a0That contrasts with the public\u2019s views: most Americans think climate change is either affecting the environment now (56 percent) or will do so in the future (23 percent). \u00a0Just 17 percent of the public thinks global warming won\u2019t have a serious impact, and 1 percent thinks it doesn\u2019t exist. \u00a0 This poll was conducted by telephone December 9-13, 2016 among a random sample of 1,259 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.  The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.  Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.  The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample and the sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request.

            "article_content": "BOISE, Idaho - The population of American prisons is likely to rise for the first time in nearly a decade with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s promise to detain and deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally and his selection of tough-on-crime Sen. Jeff Sessions to the nation\u2019s highest law enforcement post. If so, one of the prime beneficiaries would be the private companies that operate many of the nation\u2019s prisons. The stock market seems to agree. A day after the election, CoreCivic Co., formerly Corrections Corporation of America, saw the biggest percentage gain on the New York Stock Exchange with shares climbing 43 percent. Shares of Geo Group, another private prison company, also jumped 21 percent. The federal prison population had been trending down for nearly a decade when the Obama administration announced in August that it would phase out its use of some private facilities. The announcement followed a Justice Department audit saying private facilities have more safety and security problems than government-run lockups. The policy change did not cover private prisons used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, though federal officials have said they are considering phasing out private contractor immigration facilities. Trump, however, said during his campaign that the nation\u2019s prison system was a mess and voiced support for private prisons. \u201cI do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons. It seems to work a lot better,\u201d Trump told MSNBC in March, though he didn\u2019t offer any details on what that might mean for the federal prison system. Immigration and Customs Enforcement holds up to 34,000 immigrants awaiting deportation. Forty-six of the roughly 180 facilities in which ICE holds those immigrants are privately run, with about 73 percent of detainees held in the private facilities, the agency says. \u201cTrump was saying during his 100-day plan that mandatory minimums for people re-entering the country would be set at two years - that\u2019s going to require a longer-term need for beds,\u201d said Michael Kodesch, a senior associate with financial services firm Canaccord Genuity Inc. Immigration detention centers are particularly profitable for private prison companies because they command a higher rate for each inmate bed, he said. Yet what\u2019s good for investors isn\u2019t good for the country, said Bob Libal, executive director of Grassroots Leadership, a national nonprofit group that works to reduce incarceration and detention rates. \u201cThey\u2019re handing the keys to a deportation machine over to the Trump administration,\u201d Libal said. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s no reason to believe that the Trump administration won\u2019t drive that machine forward through human rights protections or due process protections people in the detention system.\u201d Sessions, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, was among a handful of Republican senators blocking a bipartisan bill that would reduce lengthy sentences for low-level drug offenders. McLaurine Klingler, a spokeswoman for Sessions, said no one on Sessions\u2019 staff was immediately available to talk about his feelings on the DOJ\u2019s use on private prisons. CoreCivic spokesman Jonathan Burns said the company doesn\u2019t take positions on proposals, legislation or policies that would determine the basis of an individual\u2019s incarceration or detention. He said the company instead works to \u201ceducate lawmakers on the benefits of public-private partnership generally and the solutions CoreCivic provides.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration stance was a central part of his campaign message in 2016 -- and he said in an interview Sunday that he plans to immediately deport approximately 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants. \u201cWhat we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,\u201d Trump said in an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019re getting them out of our country, they\u2019re here illegally.\u201d  He continued by saying that after the border is \u201csecure,\u201d immigration officials will begin to make a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the remaining undocumented immigrants in the U.S.  \u201cAfter the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that they\u2019re talking about who are terrific people, they\u2019re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut before we make that determination...it\u2019s very important, we are going to secure our border.\u201d Asked whether he really plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border -- a proposal that served as a centerpiece of his campaign message -- Trump replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Since Trump\u2019s election on Tuesday night, the realities of actually building that wall have begun to set in. The Mexican government has publicly reminded him that Mexico will not pay for the wall. And asked about the wall, Trump transition co-chair Newt Gingrich said the wall was \u201ca great campaign device.\u201d Trump also told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that the border wall, which was one of the centerpieces of his campaign platform, could be part wall and \u201csome fencing,\u201d in accordance with what congressional Republicans have proposed. \u201cFor certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very good at this, it\u2019s called construction.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, is making his first trip Thursday to the nation\u2019s capital after his Election Night victory, meeting Thursday with President Obama and other top Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. On Wednesday, President Obama pledged to help with a smooth transfer of power, echoing\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s election night call\u00a0for Americans to unite after the divisive election. In Trump\u2019s meeting with GOP congressional leaders, given that Republicans control the House and Senate, there will likely be big-ticket items on the list, reports CBS News correspondent Major Garrett. While both the president and president-elect have been gracious since the election, it is hard to forget some of the things they said about each other during the course of the campaign.\u00a0 \u201cIf his closest advisers don\u2019t trust him to tweet, why would any of us trust him with the nuclear codes,\u201d Mr. Obama said during a Philadelphia rally. And Trump has said of the president that he \u201cis essentially incompetent,\u201d and he spent \u00a0months before and during the 2012 presidential campaign questioning whether Mr. Obama was born in the U.S. Follow along with our live-blog of his first transition meetings:\u00a0 3:14 p.m.\u00a0Trump, his wife Melania, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell paused before cameras after leaving McConnell\u2019s office. When Trump was asked about his legislative priorities, he said, \u201cWell, we have a lot.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to look very strongly at immigration.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe are going to look very strongly at healthcare,\u201d he added, \u201cand we\u2019re looking at jobs, big league jobs.\u201d 2:38: p.m. ET Pence leaves the Capitol on his own to meet with Vice President Joe Biden at the White House. 2:15 p.m. ET Trump and Pence meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol\u2019s Senate Leadership Office. 2:14 p.m. ET\u00a0A man was detained by Capitol Hill Police in front of the Capitol Hill Club, according to pool reports. The individual was yelling at people who were hanging around to see Trump, who lunched there with House Speaker Paul Ryan.\u00a0 Police reportedly told the man to quiet down but he refused, saying he had a right to yell at Trump supporters, and they started to detain him. The man appeared to cooperate, though he was still speaking as they put him in a van.\u00a0 2:01 p.m. ET House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared with Trump and vice president-elect Mike Pence in front of reporters at a conference room in the Capitol. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, sat next to her husband.\u00a0 Ryan commended Trump for \u201cone of the most impressive\u201d election victories \u201cI\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He added that he was \u201cexcited\u201d about the opportunity to work with Trump.\u00a0 \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do some absolutely spectacular things for the American people,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cWe can\u2019t get started fast enough, whether it\u2019s healthcare or immigration -- so many different things.\u201d\u00a0 Trump called the gathering a \u201cvery good meeting, a very detailed meeting,\u201d and mentioned some policies on his agenda, including lowering taxes, and making health care more affordable.\u00a0 Ryan then took the president-elect and his wife out on the House Speaker\u2019s balcony of the Capitol building to show off the view. Ryan pointed out to Trump where he will be inaugurated.\u00a0 As Trump and Pence walked by reporters, Trump said the balcony tour was \u201creally beautiful.\u201d\u00a0 1:30 p.m. ET President Obama and President-Elect Trump met alone in the Oval Office for 90 minutes, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters shortly after the two met. There was no staff in the room with Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. And their meeting, Earnest said, was \u201cat least a little less awkward than some might have expected.\u201d During the meeting, Mr. Obama talked about his upcoming trip abroad, to Greece, Germany and Peru -- his final foreign trip as president -- and he described for Mr. Trump some of the issues he expects to come up with other world leaders, Earnest said. The two spent a large part of the meeting talking about staffing and organizing the White House. \u201cThat\u2019s complicated business,\u201d Earnest said. It must be structured to deal with multiple crises simultaneously. 12:59 p.m. ET Trump flashed a thumbs-up from his car as he arrived at the Capitol Hill club for his meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Vice President-elect Mike Pence arrived earlier. 12:47 p.m. ET President Obama and president-elect Trump gave brief statements to the press in the Oval Office.\u00a0 Mr. Obama called it an \u201cexcellent meeting\u201d and said he was encouraged by the Trump transition team\u2019s interest in working with the White House.\u00a0 \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s wanting to work with my team around the many issues this great country faces,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt is important for all of us, regardless of party... to now come together, work together to deal with the many challenges we face.\u201d He added of the first lady: \u201cMichelle has had a chance to greet the incoming first lady... we want to make sure that they feel welcome...We now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed.\u201d Trump also gave remarks to the press, saying he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for his predecessor and calling him a \u201cgood man.\u201d He added that the two discussed several things -- \u201csome wonderful,\u201d and some not so wonderful. Turning to Mr. Obama, Trump said, \u201cI look forward to being with you many, many more times.\u201d The two shook hands after the meeting, which lasted more than 90 minutes. 12:35 p.m. ET Pool cameras were was ushered into the Oval Office for a photo opportunity. The president and president-elect sat in high-backed armchairs at the end of the room, as is typical for when the President speaks to world leaders. Both men spoke briefly, according to pool reports.\u00a0 12:10 p.m. ET Pence\u2019s motorcade arrives at the Capitol Hill Club, where he and Trump are scheduled to meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan.\u00a0 This afternoon, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi took a call from the vice president-elect, according to a statement by a Pelosi aide. Pelosi congratulated him on his win and the two agreed on the need to find common ground. Pelosi and Pence, who had once served in the House as a congressman from Indiana, said that they would also meet face-to-face in the following weeks.\u00a0 12:07 p.m. ET White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner were seen walking back from the lawn and across the Rose Garden, according to pool reports. McDonough led Kushner, who is part of Trump\u2019s transition team, up the colonnade, followed by the same group of aides who\u2019d left them on their own for the walk. They entered the White House, looked up briefly when a reporter called out \u201cDenis!\u201d but did not respond. 12:05 p.m. ET Pence\u2019s plane arrives in Washington, D.C. 11:00 a.m. ET Trump arrives to meet President Obama at the White House.\u00a0 In the afternoon, the president also welcomes the Cleveland Cavaliers to the White House to honor the team and their 2016 NBA Championship. 10:25 a.m. ET Trump\u2019s plane arrived at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Reagan National airport.\u00a0 9:45 a.m. ET Trump departed from New York\u2019s La Guardia airport to head to Washington, D.C. 9:00 a.m. ET\u00a0Here\u2019s the schedule for Donald Trump and Mike Pence\u2019s meetings:\u00a0 At 11:00 a.m. ET, President-elect Trump will meet with President Obama in the Oval Office.\u00a0 At 12:30 p.m. ET, Trump and Pence will meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, at the Capitol Hill Club.\u00a0 At 1:30 p.m. ET,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, will host the president elect and vice resident-elect for a meeting in his Capitol office today.

            "article_content": "One primary reason U.S. equities have been pushing higher and moving the Dow Jones industrials index near the 20,000 threshold -- before Wednesday\u2019s 119-point drop on Fed rate hike worries -- is a surge in big-cap technology stocks. This is a reversal of the recent trend of tech stocks lagging in the post-election rally, and it could get a boost from Wednesday\u2019s \u201ctech summit\u201d between Silicon Valley leaders and President-elect Donald Trump.  The tech stocks\u2019 move has reinvigorated the post-election market melt-up that had been led by \u201chard economy\u201d plays like industrials, materials, financials and energy stocks as investors responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plans, which amount to an aggressive fiscal stimulus of tax cuts and infrastructure spending.  Moreover, his anti-immigration stance suggested companies like Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) -- which are heavy users of H1-B skilled worker visas -- would see a clampdown on cheaper foreign labor. That would boost their expenses and weigh on profitability. Along with portfolio outflows as hedge funds and other investors sold post-election underperformers to chase new leaders, the result was a disappointing share price performance for the group over the past month (chart below).  One top topic at the Wednesday meeting between Trump and the tech CEOs was how to bring high-paying jobs back to the U.S. The industry already seems to see the writing on the wall, with IBM (IBM) CEO Ginni Rommety writing an op-ed in USA Today touting Big Blue\u2019s plans to hire 25,000 people in the U.S. and invest $1 billion over the next four years in \u201cnew collar\u201d jobs via employee vocational training.  But more than that, the meeting provided a chance to patch up relations between one of the fastest growing, most dynamic sectors of the American economy and the incoming Trump administration -- two groups that were often at odds with each other during the heated campaign season.\u00a0 While disagreements may linger on issues like net neutrality, \u201cfake news\u201d censorship and immigration, common ground on issues like corporate tax cuts and repatriation of capital being held abroad may well be found.  Just look at Apple (AAPL): Of the company\u2019s more than $215 billion cash and cash-like reserves, nearly $178 billion of it is parked overseas.\u00a0 According to Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research, cutting the tax rate on repatriated earnings held overseas from 35 percent to 10 percent could bring back upwards of $2.4 trillion in cash. This could fuel not only investment spending and hiring at home but also fresh share purchase buybacks and dividend hikes.\u00a0 All of which could be great news for not only tech sector share prices but U.S. GDP growth as well.  As for a cut in the ongoing corporate tax rate, Yardeni\u2019s researchers estimate that slicing the rate to 15 percent (from the 27.5 percent effective rate in 2015) would boost S&P 500 earnings from $132 a share in 2017 to around $155, a 17 percent increase.  It\u2019s no wonder that the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has punched up and out of a long five-month consolidation range to push to its own new record high on Tuesday. Now, with tensions lessened between the tech titans and Mr. Trump, more new records could be on tap.\u00a0 Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

The Wisconsin Republican emphasized that those with criminal records would be the focus of enforcement resources. \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with respect to immigration, securing our border, enforcing our current laws,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe talked about criminal aliens.

Now, just days after being elected the 45th president, Trump told CBS News\u2019 Lesley Stahl he has not decided whether to follow through on that particular statement. \u201cI\u2019m going to think about it,\u201d he said in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, his first sit-down interview since Election Day. \u201cUm, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on -- all of these other things that we\u2019ve been talking about.\u201d This summer, after a full investigation into Clinton\u2019s email practices while at the State Department, the FBI announced it would not be recommending charges against Clinton. Still, FBI Director James Comey said Clinton had been \u201ccareless\u201d with classified information -- which was criticism Trump and other Republicans frequently used against Clinton throughout the campaign. Last month, barely 10 days before Election Day, Comey informed Congress that the FBI was looking at new material related to the case -- but then announced last Sunday that it had not found anything to contradict its previous conclusions in the case, and said it still did not recommend any charges against Clinton. Trump told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that Clinton \u201cdid some bad things,\u201d but that ultimately the Clintons are \u201cgood people.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt them, I don\u2019t want to hurt them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re, they\u2019re good people.

In a statement to CBS News, Catz said he would like to discuss specific policy issues with Mr. Trump.  \u201cI plan to tell the President-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,\u201d the Oracle executive said. \u201cIf he can reform the tax code, reduce regulation, and negotiate better trade deals, the U.S. technology community will be stronger and more competitive than ever.\u201d  Other companies listed, like Alphabet, Apple, and Facebook, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CBS News.\u00a0 Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign grudge against Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (who also owns the Washington Post, a frequent punching bag of the president-elect during the election season), Recode reported that Bezos was also invited to the roundtable. Bezos is likely to accept that invitation.  The invites were reportedly extended by incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s few vocal supporters from the tech industry.\u00a0 During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump largely struggled to gain favor with the innovators in Silicon Valley, in part because of his proposed crackdown on immigration. Several executives, in contrast, worked with pro-immigration reform advocacy groups, like the technology-focused Fwd.us. But Mr. Trump has also drawn fire from Silicon Valley on other issues, like when he urged a boycott of Apple after the company said it would not unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.  \u201cBoycott Apple until such time as they give that information,\u201d Trump said a day before South Carolina\u2019s GOP primary. \u201cApple ought to give the security for that phone, OK. What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such a time as they give that security number. How do you like that? I just thought of it. Boycott Apple,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut Tim Cook is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. But Apple should give up, they should get the security or find other people.\u201d Mr. Trump has even lumped several technology companies in with attacks against the \u201cdishonest media.\u201d\u00a0 Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump is planning another day of transition talks. He released a short video on YouTube late Monday, laying out priorities for the start of his term. He promised to focus on creating jobs, but he did not mention repealing Obamacare or building a wall on the Mexican border, two of his most popular campaign promises. \u201cI\u2019ve asked my transition team to develop a list of executive actions we can take on day one to restore our laws and bring back our jobs. It\u2019s about time,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the video.\u00a0 It outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office including withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, loosening restrictions on energy production and cutting regulations. He also promised a hard look at the visa program, reports CBS News correspondent Chip Reid. \u201cOn immigration, I will direct the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump will head to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the holiday weekend, but before that it appears he will continue to prepare for his White House transition behind closed doors while the media anxiously watches and waits. Mr. Trump has largely sidestepped the media since winning the election two weeks ago. In 2008, then-President-elect Obama held a press conference three days after his victory. \u201cThe man works 18 hours a day, interviewing people, taking calls from across the world. And he will have a press conference in due course,\u201d top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said. Also passing through the skyscraper\u2019s lobby were a parade of job-seekers. Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, a retired member of the Army National Guard, said he should be secretary of Veterans Affairs.  \u201cI think I\u2019m the best person, but there are some tremendous people out there,\u201d Brown said.  Democratic Congresswoman and Iraq War veteran Tulsi Gabbard was invited by Mr. Trump to discuss foreign policy in Syria. She later wrote in a statement: \u201cI never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives.\u201d Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a potential pick for secretary of homeland security, was seen holding a document titled \u201cStrategic Plan for First 365 Days.\u201d   A leading critic of illegal immigration, his plan calls for adding \u201cextreme vetting questions for high-risk aliens\u201d and \u201creducing the intake of Syrian refugees to zero.\u201d  Mr. Trump has called his victory the American version of Brexit, a historic vote by British citizens to withdraw from the European Union. On Twitter Monday night, the president-elect wrote that Nigel Farage, one of Brexit\u2019s leaders, would make a great ambassador to the U.S. Britain\u2019s prime minister quickly debunked the suggestion, saying the country already has an excellent U.S. ambassador.",

            "article_content": "Anyone who lived through the 1970s is likely to shudder when they hear the term \u201cstagflation.\u201d That\u2019s the dreadful combination of rising inflation, higher unemployment and a slowing economy that hampered U.S. growth in that decade. That unappetizing stew of negative trends could return under President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s economic proposals, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs\u2019 (GS) economics team. Stagflation is a possibility under what the firm describes as its \u201cadverse\u201d forecast, based on Trump\u2019s restrictive economic proposals, which include limiting free trade. With Trump\u2019s surprise win last week, economists have been scrambling to assess what his plans will mean for the near- and long-term prospects of the U.S. economy. Many economists, Goldman\u2019s among them, are developing several scenarios because of what\u2019s viewed as a high level of uncertainty about how Trump might translate his proposals -- such as a 45 percent trade tariff on Chinese imports -- into political reality.\u00a0 \u201cThe positive fiscal impulse from his tax reform and infrastructure proposals could provide a near-term boost to growth and, depending on the specifics, could have positive longer-run supply side effects,\u201d Goldman economists wrote in their report. \u201cHowever, other proposals could lead to new restrictions on foreign trade and immigration, which could have negative implications for growth, particularly over the longer term.\u201d Removing the country\u2019s estimated 8 million illegal workers would likely be negative for the U.S. economy. \u00a0Recent research from Queens College CUNY economists noted that these workers currently contribute about 3 percent of private sector GDP, or about $5 trillion over a decade.\u00a0 Given the uncertainty over how Trump\u2019s campaign promises will translate into economic policy, the Goldman team ran through three scenarios.\u00a0 The first considers what Goldman calls Trump\u2019s \u201cfull\u201d case, assuming that everything he has promised will be enacted, while the \u201cbenign projection\u201d assumes only his fiscal policies are carried out, such as tax reform. The last forecast -- its \u201cadverse\u201d scenario -- includes Trump\u2019s more restrictive trade and immigration policies, as well as a more hawkish Federal Reserve.\u00a0 Stagflation would be the outcome in the adverse scenario, Goldman noted. Real GDP growth would decline by about 0.8 percentage points in 2018 and 2019, while inflation would rise to 2.3 percent in 2019. Unemployment would rise to 5.3 percent, roughly its level during early 2008 at the start of the recession.\u00a0 Still, that\u2019s a far cry from the stagflation that crushed many American households in the 1970s, when inflation rose as high as 12 percent and unemployment was above 7 percent. Yet it would represent a setback from the current economic trends of lower unemployment and a stable inflation rate.\u00a0 Goldman isn\u2019t alone in assessing different economic scenarios under Trump. Oxford Economics on Monday published a report with a similar approach, providing baseline, upside and downside scenarios. Oxford\u2019s downside view sees the economy shrinking by 5 percent by 2020 and losing 4 million jobs.\u00a0 \u201cOur downside scenario assumes that, after a brief honeymoon period, President Trump reverts to his highly protectionist and isolationist stance,\u201d wrote Gregory Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics, in the Oxford report. \u201cHis refusal to negotiate with Congress means Republicans refuse any increase in the deficit. Global aversion to the U.S. combines with heightened domestic policy uncertainty.\u201d The president has the executive power to cancel trade agreements (such as NAFTA), impose tariffs and nix some business regulations, but many of Trump\u2019s proposals would need the green light from Congress, such as repealing the Affordable Care Act and on fiscal policies, Daco added.\u00a0 \u201cAnd while Republicans hold a majority in Congress, there is no guarantee that Mr. Trump would find common ground in negotiations with members of his own party,\u201d he noted. \u201cTraditionally, elections have reduced political and policy uncertainty, but in this case the uncertainty remains unusually elevated.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- Immigrants, their advocates and others opposing a Donald Trump presidency continued to protest Sunday, speaking out against the president-elect\u2019s support of deportation and other measures. Organizers in Manhattan carried signs in English and Spanish saying things like \u201cHate won\u2019t make us great,\u201d and chanted, \u201cWe are here to stay.\u201d As the protests continued across the country,President-elect Trumptold \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl about his mass deportation plans and urged Americans of all stripes to give him a chance after a tumultuous campaign that saw vitriol largely replace serious debate over policy. He also urged those people reportedly harassing Muslims and immigrant groups to \u201cstop it.\u201d\u00a0 More than 1,000 people joined the march in New York City that started mid-afternoon and extended into the evening.  The area surrounding the president-elect\u2019s Midtown home had become like a fortress, with Secret Service agents and NYPD \u00a0officers going to extremes to protect the future president, CBS New York reported. It was the latest in days of demonstrations across the country, and even throughout the world. Protests were held Sunday in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia and more cities. Several hundred protesters Sunday marched around Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall and then down Market Street to Independence Mall, carrying signs and chanting \u201cDonald Trump has got to go!\u201d and \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d In Los Angeles, a few hundred people gathered outside CNN\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters, and in San Francisco, hundreds of people, including many families with children, marched from Golden Gate Park to Ocean Beach chanting \u201cLove trumps hate!\u201d By nightfall, a few hundred people marched across downtown San Francisco\u2019s main street, blocking traffic at an intersection when they held a sit-down protest. Elsewhere in California, about 800 people marched through Sacramento and thousands others formed a human chain around the nearly 3.5-mile perimeter of Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt. Rallies in Oakland have at times become unruly, but those who came to the lake held hands and chanted, \u201cWe reject the president-elect.\u201d In Oregon, protesters marched through Portland again Sunday night following a gathering of anti-Trump demonstrators earlier in the evening. Television footage showed dozens of chanting but peaceful marchers moving through downtown streets. Sunday night\u2019s protest came after police said they arrested 71 people late Saturday and early Sunday during downtown protests. Demonstrations also took place internationally. On Saturday, a group of Mexicans at statue representing independence in Mexico City expressed their concerns about a possible wave of deportations. One school teacher said it would add to the \u201cunrest\u201d that\u2019s already in Mexico. About 300 people protested Trump\u2019s election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy near the landmark Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Mostly, the demonstrations were peaceful. However, in Portland, Oregon, a man was shot and wounded Saturday morning during a confrontation. Police arrested two teenagers in the shooting.",

            "article_content": "Silicon Valley may be the mecca of tech innovation, but it is struggling to adapt to the electoral earthquake that propelled Donald Trump, a candidate who drew near-universal scorn from tech power players, to the White House. Venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and tech employees are bracing for the switch from a president who openly admired the tech industry, to one who -- on the campaign trail, at least -- viewed its ascendancy with skepticism. That\u2019s despite the possibility that Trump may go down in history as one of the savviest users of social media (Twitter, in particular) on the planet. A key point of conflict: Silicon Valley\u2019s innovations tend to eliminate blue-collar American jobs, which Trump has promised to restore. Many of the Valley\u2019s most promising projects in the pipeline, including automated vehicles, could inflict even more carnage, although tech supporters argue that the resulting efficiency gains would provide a big boost to the economy. The industry also thrives on immigration, and Trump has promised a crackdown on that.\u00a0 Meantime, the tech sector\u2019s financial lifeblood comes from private-equity and venture-capital investors, who bank on the carried-interest tax loophole, which Trump (in agreement with Hillary Clinton) has promised to eliminate. With this tax break, the investors pay a lower rate on their profits than than the IRS charges for ordinary income. Worry among Valley thought leaders runs so deep that after Trump\u2019s triumph, several folks quickly signed on to a quixotic movement launched by Shervin Pishevar, co-founder of high-speed train startup Hyperloop One and an investor in the car service Uber, to push for California to become an independent country. \u201cIt\u2019s the most patriotic thing we can do,\u201d Pishevar wrote on Twitter. \u201cCountry is at serious crossroads. We can reenter the union after California becomes a nation.\u201d He later clarified his tweet to say he doesn\u2019t want California to secede, but rather to \u201cfight against a centralized Federal gov that\u2019s amassed too much power.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly showed animosity toward the tech industry. He sided with the FBI in a high-profile battle with Apple (AAPL) over whether the tech giant should be forced to build a backdoor to access data on its iPhones, allowing government snooping on customers.\u00a0 He also implied he would force hardware companies like Apple to bring back their offshore-based manufacturing operations to the U.S. Such a move would put them in a tough competitive position against foreign rivals because production costs are lower in many overseas locations. Trump also pledged to allow fewer foreign employees to work in the U.S. on H1B visas, which grant temporary status here for those with specialities, such as in technology. And his rhetoric on Muslim and Latino immigrants was seen as an affront to the tech industry\u2019s stated commitment to diversity and inclusion.\u00a0 Not helping matters: The president-elect recently added billionaire investor and Paypal founder Peter Thiel, who went from quirky insider to Valley outcast after embracing Trump\u2019s campaign, to the presidential transition team. \u00a0 The tech industry is not alone in fearing a Trump presidency: The political novice is a virtual blank slate in terms of policy, which has disconcerted executives in areas ranging from finance to health care. Still, it\u2019s entirely possible the prolific Twitter user (who reportedly does not use email or even a computer) will be more of a supporter of the tech industry than his campaign suggests. Stock indexes rallied to new highs this past week (although tech shares sat out much of the gains), as relieved investors bid up shares amid more measured remarks from the incoming president. Trump struck a conciliatory tone in his acceptance speech and signaled his first priority as president will be investing tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure. The tone was a far cry from the divisive language he deployed during his campaign. Tech leaders in the Valley took to Twitter, naturally, to lament -- as well as offer hope -- to their frustrated followers. \u201cThis is a bad beat for the U.S. But tomorrow the sun will come up and we\u2019ll get on with figuring it out. Be decent, be proud. Work hard. Hope,\u201d wrote John Lilly, a venture capitalist and former chief executive officer of Mozilla, the open-source software firm \u201cIt\u2019s two steps forward, one step back. This is a step back. Next two are forward,\u201d said Stewart Butterfield, CEO of Slack, the instant messaging company. \u201cSo many disastrous ideas have been surfaced throughout this election. We must now do everything we can to ensure America is for everyone,\u201d said Aaron Levie, CEO of cloud storage provider Box (BOX) . Added AOL co-founder Steve Case, quoting Winston Churchill: \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In the final sprint to Election Day, Hillary Clinton is painting a grim picture of what a Donald Trump presidency would mean for Americans. \u201cImagine it is January 20, 2017,\u201d Clinton urged supporters gathered at Arizona State University in Tempe Wednesday. \u201cAnd imagine if it\u2019s Donald Trump standing in front of the Capitol.\u201d  She\u2019s reminding voters of the more controversial things he\u2019s said about specific groups of Americans. \u201cImagine he is taking the oath of office,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then imagine what it will be like to have him in the Oval Office making the decisions that affect your lives and your futures. Imagine having a president who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults Latinos, African Americans Muslims, POWs, who pits people against each other instead of pulling us together.\u201d  A Trump presidency, she argues, would be a setback for women and girls, Clinton is telling audiences. She invoked Carly Fiorina, one of Trump\u2019s Republican\u00a0primary opponents,\u00a0in her portrayal of him as a dangerous example for American children.  \u201cJust think about what happens if he were to win to women and girls,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt would mean that our girls would grow up with a president who proudly and loudly ranks women by their looks including the only woman running in the Republican primary.\u201d  \u201cRemember what he said about Carly Fiorina?\u201d she asked. \u201cA distinguished women with a tremendous record of accomplishment. Trump said nobody will vote for her -- look at her face.\u201d For immigrants, Clinton imagines a difficult future under Trump, who, she posits, would appoint the tough-on-immigration Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio to lead the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.  \u201cHis top adviser on immigration is Sheriff Joe Arpaio,\u201d Clinton said in Arizona, a state with a large Hispanic population. \u201cJust last week, Sheriff Arpaio was officially charged with criminal contempt of court because he refused to stop racially profiling Latinos. Now imagine Donald Trump appointing the sheriff our next secretary of Homeland Security to oversee the massive deportation force.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s swing through Arizona is an indication of the campaign\u2019s thinking when it comes to the electoral map. The state, deeply red, has only elected one Democrat in the last sixty or so years: her husband, Bill Clinton. But as the race tightens nationally, polls show Clinton is now within striking distance of the Republican nominee in Arizona. According to this weekend\u2019s CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, Trump leads by just two points, 44 percent to Clinton\u2019s 42 percent. Ending on a more hopeful note, Clinton told Tempe rally-goers, numbering about 15,000: \u201cAs the political pundits like to say, this state is in play for the first time in years...We have a real chance to turn this state blue again.\u201d",

            "article_content": "During his presidential campaign Donald Trump repeatedly boasted that if he were to win the White House, it would be an extension of the same sentiments that led to the United Kingdom\u2019s surprise vote to leave the European Union this June. (\u201cIt will be called Brexit-plus-plus-plus,\u201d he said on Monday.) Trump stunned Washington\u2014and the world\u2014Tuesday night when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton and was elected as the country\u2019s 45th president. But the same sentiments and discontent that fueled his rise are at play across the world, including in several countries slated to hold elections in the coming months.  The brand of right-wing populism and economic nationalism Trump and his supporters championed is alive and well in more places than one around the world, and citizens of those countries no doubt watched Tuesday\u2019s results roll in with interest. With that in mind, here is a guide to where else in the world to watch for a Trump-like phenomenon at the ballot box: Austria, the country of just under 9 million people in central Europe, could be just weeks away from electing the first far-right head of state in the European Union. Norbert Hofer, head of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, lost the May runoff election by less than one\u00a0percent of the vote. However the results of that vote were annulled by a federal court\u2014prompting the re-vote, which will take place on Dec. 4.  Hofer has campaigned on a platform of \u201cputting Austria first,\u201d calling for a referendum on the country\u2019s membership in the European Union. And as Europe reels from the Syrian refugee crisis, Hofer has said Islam \u201chas no place in Austria.\u201d Opinion polling in late October and early November gives Hofer a slim but consistent lead over his opponent, independent candidate Alexander Van der Bellen. In Austria, the presidency is a largely ceremonial role. But if elected, Hofer\u2019s rise could portend similar movements across Europe\u2014and make Austria\u2019s neighbors, particularly Germany, nervous for their own elections in less than a year. The Netherlands, too, is facing the possibility that a far-right party could lead its government after the country\u2019s general elections next March: a man by the name of Geert Wilders. (Wilders, with his helmet of blonde hair, has even drawn visual comparisons with Trump.)  Wilders, who leads the country\u2019s Freedom Party, has risen to prominence on a platform of halting what he calls the \u201cIslamization of the Netherlands.\u201d He has proposed halting all construction of new mosques, banning the Quran from the country and ending Muslim immigration. Like other right-wing populist movements across Europe, Wilders\u2019 Freedom Party is also anti-European Union. In the Dutch general election of 2012, Wilders and his Freedom Party came in first, edging out the Labour Party to win a plurality of seats in the parliament. Recent polls in the race put the Freedom Party either slightly ahead or tied for first in the parliament next spring.  Speaking at an event in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention this summer, where he traveled to show his support for Trump, Wilders said he expects to become the next prime minister if the Freedom Party comes in first place in March. It\u2019s fairly telling that one of the first world political figures to congratulate Trump on his victory early Wednesday morning was Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right French National Front party.  \u201cToday, the United States,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cTomorrow, France. Bravo!\u201d Le Pen is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, the far-right leader who reached the second round of France\u2019s 2002 presidential election (only to be solidly defeated by Jacques Chirac). And she has a real shot at being one of the final two candidates in France\u2019s 2017 presidential election. France votes in two stages: the first round on April 23 includes all parties, then the top two vote-getters advance to the second-round election on May 7. Because current French president Francois Hollande is hugely unpopular, there is a good chance Le Pen could edge him out to become one of the two candidates in the second round of voting.  In recent polls, Le Pen consistently comes in first or second along with a Republican candidate, either Alain Jupp\u00e9 or former President Nicolas Sarkozy. (The Republican primary will be held this Nov. 20 and 27.)  It\u2019s highly unlikely Le Pen could do what her father couldn\u2019t and actually win the presidency in the second round: in one-on-one polling simulations between Le Pen and Jupp\u00e9 or Le Pen and Sarkozy, she loses by double digits. But she will undoubtedly be one of the biggest players in French politics next year. The rise of Germany\u2019s anti-immigrant party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) is one of the best-covered right-wing populist movements in the world right now, after Brexit and Trump\u2014and AfD is poised to win seats in the Bundestag, Germany\u2019s national parliament, when the country votes in its federal elections next fall. The party, which launched in 2013 as a party for Euro-skeptics, won 4.7 percent in the 2013 German federal elections\u2014just shy of the 5 percent threshold for receiving seats in the Bundestag. But as German Chancellor Angela Merkel directed Germany to accept large numbers of Syrian refugees, AfD rebranded itself as an anti-immigrant party and capitalized on the growing fear and negative sentiment toward migrants.  AfD has already posted some victories in state elections around Germany, most notably in Saxony-Anhalt (where it came in second with 24.2 percent of the vote), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (where it came in second with 20.8 percent) and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (where it placed third with 15.1 percent). Even in Berlin, which is a stronghold for the center-left Social Democrats, AfD won 14.2 percent of the vote in this fall\u2019s state elections. To be clear, it\u2019s incredibly unlikely that AfD would ever come in first in Germany\u2019s federal elections, slated for next September or October. Merkel\u2019s party, the center-right Christian Democrats, has a large majority in the Bundestag; assuming Merkel chooses to run again next year, she is the favorite to win a fourth term in office. But AfD\u2019s rise has concerned longtime politicians and party operatives in Berlin, who will likely have to contend with an AfD that has actual seats in parliament.\u00a0 Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump has named generals to his Cabinet. He\u2019s chosen business leaders and Wall Street executives.  He\u2019s also named a number of people who currently hold elected office: including one U.S. senator, Jeff Sessions; House members Tom Price, and Mike Pompeo; and two governors, Nikki Haley of South Carolina and Terry Branstad of Iowa.  All of Mr. Trump\u2019s high-level Cabinet nominees will have to be confirmed by the U.S. senate before they can give up their current jobs, but once that happens, someone will have to fill the vacancy that\u2019s left. The rules are different for every position, and many of them differ by state as well: some will automatically be succeeded by other elected officials, while others will have their replacements appointed by their state\u2019s governor or elected in a special election. Here\u2019s a look at which Cabinet nominees currently hold elected office, and what happens to their jobs when they join the administration: Sessions, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, is the junior senator from Alabama.  If Sessions is confirmed, Alabama state election laws require a special election be held to fill the seat. Governor Robert Bentley, a Republican, can both appoint someone to fill the seat in the meantime and set the date of the special election. Bentley has asked the state Republican Party\u2019s executive committee to send him some suggestions, and Bentley will go from there. Though Sessions will need to be confirmed before a successor can be named, there are already plenty of Alabama Republicans interested in the seat.  Among those who have said they are interested, or would accept the job if it were offered, are: Attorney General Luther Strange; U.S. Reps. Robert Aderholt, Mo Brooks, Martha Roby and Mike Rogers; state Sens. Dick Brewbaker, Del Marsh, Arthur Orr, Trip Pittman and Cam Ward; and Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs Director Jim Byard Jr. One Alabama congressman, Bradley Byrne, said he is not interested in the seat and would like to remain in the House. Thus far, Mr. Trump has selected two members of the House for Cabinet-level positions: Georgia Rep. Tom Price for health and human services secretary, and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo for director of the CIA. According to the U.S. Constitution, vacancies in the U.S. House must be filled by election. If the vacancy happens during the first session of Congress -- as these would -- the seats would be filled by special election in each state, on dates to be determined. While it\u2019s again a bit early to say exactly who will run in either of these races, a few local pols are expressing tentative interest. In Georgia, Price\u2019s wife, state Rep. Betty Price, could be a contender to replace him in the House. Other names being mentioned there include former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel; state House Speaker Pro Tempore Jan Jones; state Sens. Brandon Beach and Judson Hill; state Rep. Chuck Martin; immigration lawyer Charles Kuck; and former political fundraiser Cade Joiner, among others. And in Kansas, Trump adviser Alan Cobb, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s national coalitions director and works for the transition team, has expressed interest in Pompeo\u2019s seat. Mr. Trump has selected two governors for Cabinet and appointed positions: Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina, will be his representative to the United Nations, while Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad is Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for U.S. ambassador to China. The process is similar and pretty straightforward in both states: governors are replaced by their lieutenant governors. In Iowa, that\u2019s Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds -- who incidentally would become the first female governor in the state\u2019s history. (Iowa is one of twenty-three states that has never had a female governor.) In South Carolina, Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster would step up and become governor if Haley is confirmed for the UN post. However, there\u2019s a bit of drama about what happens to McMaster\u2019s position as lieutenant governor if he fills Haley\u2019s job.  The state constitution says the President Pro-Tempore of the state Senate would become lieutenant governor if the sitting lieutenant governor vacates the job -- but the man who currently holds that position, Hugh Leatherman, has refused to become lieutenant governor.  Making it even more complicated is the fact that South Carolina\u2019s state legislature passed a law in 2014 to make some changes to the electoral and political system -- one of which allows the governor to immediately fill a vacancy in the lieutenant governor\u2019s office. That rule, however, is not slated to take effect until after the 2018 midterm elections. State legislators have asked South Carolina\u2019s Supreme Court to clarify whether McMaster would be allowed to appoint his replacement in this case, and to help determine what happens if the person who\u2019s supposed to be elevated to the job refuses it. Mr. Trump named Pruitt to be his next head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in early December.  Should Pruitt be confirmed to the post, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin will choose his replacement. That person would serve in the role for almost two years, since the next election isn\u2019t until fall 2018. Several potential names have come up for the post, according to The Oklahoman, including Oklahoma Secretary of State Mike Hunter, former attorney general candidate Ryan Leonard and A.J. Ferate, the general counsel for the Oklahoma Republican Party. All three have expressed interest in the job, or said they\u2019d be open to discussing it.

            "article_content": "PARIS, France -- French Prime Minister Manuel Valls stepped down Tuesday to focus on running for president in next year\u2019s election and was replaced by Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, a man who embodies the fight against Islamic extremism. Valls resigned a day after announcing his candidacy in the wake of President Francois Hollande\u2019s decision not to run for a second term last week. Valls hopes to unite Socialists and give the left a chance to stay at the Elysee Palace despite current opinion polls suggesting the second round of the election could pit Marine Le Pen, the leader of thefar-right National Front, against conservative Francois Fillon. The 53-year-old Cazeneuve is a close ally of Hollande and became a popular figure in French politics as the champion of measures tackling extremism in his interior minister role. Cazeneuve was appointed interior minister in 2014 and had to supervise the response to a series of attacks that have claimed more than 200 lives since January 2015. In total, he championed three counterterrorism laws and one intelligence law. He has also been in charge of implementing France\u2019s state of emergency following the Paris attacks that killed 130 people. After a brief meeting with Valls at the Elysee, Hollande posted a message on Twitter announcing Cazeneuve\u2019s appointment, which was also confirmed by the presidential palace press office. A leading yet divisive figure of the Socialist party, Valls is known for his outspoken, authoritarian style and his tough views on immigration and security. Valls is the top contender in the primary next month for Socialist candidates and their allies before France\u2019s two-part presidential election in April and May. But he will face tough competition from fellow Socialists. Valls has been harshly criticized by members of his own party after championing tough labor reforms and endorsing a controversial ban last summer on the Islamic \u201cburkini\u201d swimsuit. Cazeneuve was the mayor of the northern city of Cherbourg-Octeville for more than a decade before being appointed to government minister positions since 2012. Widely regarded as a hard worker, Cazeneuve was Hollande\u2019s spokesman during the president\u2019s winning campaign in 2012 and the two enjoy a trusting relationship.",

            "article_content": "Is Donald Trump\u2019s transition effort falling behind? With some stalling as Mike Pence took over the transition team and the purging of several members, there\u2019s been speculation that Trump\u2019s team is unprepared to accomplish everything it will need to before the GOP businessman takes the oath of office. But how does his transition timeline compare to previous presidents-elect?  On the campaign trail, a tough-talking Donald Trump vowed to \u201cbomb the hell out of ISIS\u201d and put an end to what he called China\u2019s economic \u201crape\u201d of the United States. We look in more detail at the real-world challenges behind those rhetorical flourishes, and find a far-more complex battle with ISIS than bombs alone can resolve, and conflicts of interest from the outset in dealing with the economic giant of Asia. President-elect Donald Trump has begun making offers for some posts in his administration, according to sources with direct knowledge of the deliberations. We\u2019ve got a list of Mr. Trump\u2019s overwhelming favorites for a handful of key positions -- all of them highly regarded by the incoming president. Some consumers are protesting Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory by letting their money do the talking. The #GrabYourWallet campaign is pushing major retailers to drop products linked to the president-elect and his daughter Ivanka. The organizers of the campaign tell CBS News what they hope accomplish.  Wilbur Ross, a leading contender to be appointed as the nation\u2019s next Secretary of Commerce, is viewed by proponents as a savior of distressed companies and by detractors as a predatory \u201cvulture investor.\u201d We look at the financier\u2019s career, and why he could be a controversial choice for the government post.  Silicon Valley may be ground zero for innovation, but it seems unprepared for the earthquake caused by the election of Donald Trump. The president-elect is no friend to their tax breaks, immigration needs and job-automating technologies. Now some industry players are vowing to fight back. After he left \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d the presidential campaign went on without Jon Stewart\u2019s unique, satirical point of view. We catch up with Stewart to discuss his new book about the more than 16 years he spent at the Comedy Central program, and he\u2019s quick to offer his post-election analysis.

            "article_content": "BERLIN - German news agency dpa says Angela Merkel will seek a fourth term as Germany\u2019s chancellor in general elections next year. Dpa, citing sources at the Berlin headquarters of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrat party, reported Sunday that she would seek re-election. If Merkel wins in 2017 and serves the entire four-year term, she would match her one-time mentor Helmut Kohl\u2019s post-war record of 16 years in office. The 62-year-old became Germany\u2019s first female head of government in 2005. She also is the first leader of a reunited Germany to have grown up under communism in the former East Germany. Merkel is widely seen as a stabilizing force in Europe amid the refugee crisis, Britain voting to leave the European Union., and the election of Donald Trump. In response to the election of Mr. Trump, Merkel penned an op-ed with President Obama.\u00a0 \u201cToday we find ourselves at a crossroads\u2014the future is upon us, and we will never return to a pre-globalization economy. Germans and Americans we must seize the opportunity to shape globalization based on our values and our ideas. We owe it to our industries and our peoples\u2014indeed, to the global community\u2014to broaden and deepen our cooperation,\u201d the two leaders wrote in a joint op-ed in the German daily Wirtschaftswoche. They wrote that both the U.S. and Germany work hard to ensure international law and norms are respected around the world and they underscored their commitments to NATO. During his presidential campaign, Trump was critical of the German leader\u2019s decision to open Germany\u2019s borders to let in hundreds of thousands of refugees. Over the summer he said, \u201cHillary Clinton wants to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel, and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany.\u201d But in September,\u00a0he praised the German leader and said he admires her.",

            "article_content": "Overseas stocks tumbled Wednesday as Donald Trump emerged as the shock victor in the U.S. presidential election. Earlier, investors had appeared persuaded that Hillary Clinton, seen as a more stable choice, would prevail. At one point, Dow futures plunged more than 4 percent and Japan\u2019s major index nosedived more than 6.1 percent, its largest drop in years. The Mexican peso likewise tumbled and investors looking for safe assets bid up the price of gold. \u00a0Futures tied to the broader S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 fell more than 5 percent around midnight. Trading in S&P and Nasdaq futures was briefly paused early Wednesday, CNBC reported. That\u2019s seen as a sign that the New York Stock Exchange could activate its circuit breakers sometime after U.S. markets open Wednesday. The circuit breakers \u2013 mandatory \u201ctime outs\u201d for Wall Street traders \u2013 kick in when the S&P500 plunges 7 percent from the previous day\u2019s close, with additional breaks for 13 percent and 20 percent drops. \u201cRight now, the markets are heading for the hills, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d Robert Tipp, chief investments strategist for global bonds and foreign exchange at Prudential Fixed Income told CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s a function of fear as much as fact.\u201d During the campaign, Trump threatened to rip up trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. He pledged to greatly restrict immigration to the U.S and to build a wall along the United States\u2019 southern border and force Mexico to pay for it.\u00a0 On news of his victory the Mexican peso\u2019s value tumbled 13 percent, leaving the currency above the 20 peso per dollar mark for the first time since 1994. But the lack of clear policy details has left many worldwide uneasy over the future direction of the U.S. economy. Share prices began tumbling as soon as Trump first gained the lead in the electoral vote count.\u00a0 By the time Hillary Clinton called Trump to concede, financial markets appeared to have steadied somewhat, but analysts predicted days of turmoil.\u00a0 \u201cThis is very much a step into the unknown because we simply can\u2019t know what type of President Trump will be,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist with Capital Economics, in a note. \u201cWill he be the demagogue from the campaign trail who threatened to lock up his political opponents, punish the media, build border walls and start a global trade war? Or is he capable of becoming a statesmanlike figure who leads in a more measured manner?\u201d Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index dropped 4.4 percent to 16,410.55 and the S&P ASX/200 in Australia slipped 0.2 percent to 5,249.40. South Korea\u2019s Kospi skidded 0.6 percent to 1,991.11 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng tumbled 1.4 percent to 22,582.11. The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.2 percent to 3,142.94. Benchmarks were higher in Malaysia and Indonesia but fell in Taiwan and Singapore. \u201cRightly or wrongly, markets are going to be concerned about a Trump victory, particularly given the potential consequences for world trade and its impact on many large companies in the U.S. stock market,\u201d said Ric Spooner, chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, before the results were clear.\u00a0 \u201cLike Brexit, the rally over the last two days increases the downside potential if Donald Trump does win the election,\u201d Spooner added, referring to Britain\u2019s unexpected vote to leave the European Union that shook world markets. Trump is \u201cperforming much better than the market anticipated,\u201d TD Securities analysts said in a note. In the weeks leading up to the election, market analysts had widely predicted a Clinton win. Economic forecasters also said a shock win by Trump would trigger a sell-off in equities, rise in bond yields and other moves by investors aimed at reducing their exposure to market risks.\u00a0 \u201cGlobal markets are being shaken up. You can hear early alarm bells ringing,\u201d said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group. Trump\u2019s strong performance at the polls also has financial markets reassessing the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December, as most investors have expected.",

            "article_content": "With\u00a0less than a week to go before Election Day, Hillary Clinton still appears to have a small but steady lead over Donald Trump in several crucial battleground states.\u00a0 The presidential race is, however, tightening in Pennsylvania, where 48 percent of likely Keystone State voters say their will cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton, compared to 44 percent who say they will vote for Donald Trump, according to a Monmouth University Poll released Wednesday. The poll indicates that Clinton\u2019s lead has shrunk since the summer, when another Monmouth University poll showed her leading her Republican rival by double-digits.  \u201cClinton is still in the lead, but the race has tightened in the past four weeks,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said. \u201cIt looks like this shift was in the works even before Friday\u2019s FBI bombshell, which has made only a small contribution to this overall narrowing.\u201d In fact, only four percent of registered Pennsylvania voters say the FBI\u2019s recent news caused them to change their minds about the candidate they will support.  Trump, however, regained some support among white voters, particularly among white women, despite the nearly-month long spotlight on allegations of him engaging in lewd behavior with women. When it comes to non-white voters, however, Clinton dwarfs Trump, 83 percent to 9 percent.\u00a0 Clinton continues to dominate in areas that have historically predicted the winner of the statewide race. In Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs, the former secretary of state leads Trump by a 62 to 29 percent margin. Most of Trump\u2019s overall improvement in Pennsylvania, however, is attributed to his gains in western portion of the state, where he has a 16 point lead over Clinton.  And in an election that has seen record low favorability and approval ratings, Clinton\u2019s positive numbers have declined since last month while Trump\u2019s has ticked up. Monmouth University contacted 403 Pennsylvania residents via telephone from October 29 to November 1. The poll has a margin of error of 4.9 percent.  A similar poll released by CNN and ORC International showed that Clinton leads Trump by the same margin--4 percent--among likely Keystone State voters. When it comes to important issues, the poll says, voters have more faith in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to handle foreign policy, terrorism, health care and trade with other countries than her Republican counterpart.\u00a0 Voters, however, believe that Trump would approach economy-related issues more appropriately. What\u2019s more, the poll revealed, voters rate Clinton and Trump equally when it comes to immigration-related issues.  The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted between October 27 and November 1. It has a three point margin of error.  Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, Clinton leads Trump by six points--46 to 40 percent -- according to the final Marquette Law School poll of the race. And among early voters, Clinton receives 64 percent to 25 percent for Trump.\u00a0 On Tuesday, the Wisconsin Elections Commission reported that more than 518,000 early ballots have been cast, which would have made up 16.9 percent of 2012\u2019s presidential turnout.  The poll was conducted between October 26 and October 31, and overlapped with the FBI\u2019s unexpected announcement that it would review \u201cpertinent\u201d emails relating the probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. The news, however, didn\u2019t appear to sway voters. Clinton\u2019s lead over Trump largely remained what it was in the previous Marquette poll.  The Marquette Law School poll has a margin of error of 3.3 points, and surveyed 1,401 registered voters. Julia Boccagno is a digital journalist for CBS News.",

Mr. Trump regaled supporters in Grand Rapids with a lengthy recitation of his victories in a string of battleground states, including Michigan, which had not previously backed a Republican presidential candidate since 1988.  \u201cThey forgot about you people,\u201d Mr. Trump said of his Democratic opponents. \u201cIn four years they\u2019re not going to forget. But it\u2019s not going to work because you\u2019re not going to forget.\u201d  Several protesters were removed from his rally at DeltaPlex Arena, prompting the president-elect to declare at one point, \u201cGet \u2018em out of here.\u201d  Mr. Trump introduced Betsy DeVos, his choice for education secretary, who hails from West Michigan, and announced that Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of Dow Chemical, would lead a national manufacturing council. Liveris told the audience that Dow would soon bring a new research-and-development center to Michigan.  In Louisiana, the incoming president addressed a large crowd at an airport hangar, and at one point tossed his trademark \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat to a supporter. He noted that he\u2019d been named Time\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d and asked the crowd if the magazine should go back to its former \u201cMan of the Year.\u201d  Gauging the boisterous response, he declared the answer was yes.  Mr. Trump campaigned for Republican John Kennedy, the state treasurer who faces off Saturday against Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, a Democrat, for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. David Vitter. Neither won a majority in the November primary, leading to the runoff. Polls have shown Kennedy with a comfortable lead.  While candidate Mr. Trump was often at odds with the establishment wing of his party, the incoming president has been broadly supported by GOP leaders since the election. And he is trying to consolidate any lingering factions, most immediately in Louisiana, where a victory by Kennedy would cement the party\u2019s four-seat advantage in the new Senate.  \u201cWe need John in Washington,\u201d Mr. Trump said, speaking in front of a lectern that urged voters to \u201cGeaux Vote. Vote GOP.\u201d Trump said he needed Kennedy to help him enact his agenda.  In private, people close to Mr. Trump said he was expected to name yet another Goldman Sachs executive to his White House team. The president-elect\u2019s National Economic Council is to be led by Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer of the Wall Street bank, which Mr. Trump repeatedly complained during the election campaign would control Hillary Clinton if she won.  Washington state Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the GOP House leadership team, emerged as a leading candidate to head the Interior Department, according to a person involved in the transition.  Major decisions remain for Mr. Trump, most importantly his choice for secretary of state. The deliberations have become a source of tension within his transition team, with chief of staff Reince Priebus said to be backing Mitt Romney while other advisers oppose the idea of selecting the 2012 GOP nominee, given his fierce criticism of Mr. Trump during the campaign.  Mr. Trump announced that Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who was an early favorite, was no longer under consideration.  On a busy Friday, Mr. Trump also spoke by telephone with Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who broke with protocol during the campaign to publicly endorse Hillary Clinton and said afterward she would not maintain \u201ca diplomatic silence in the face of attitudes of racism, sexism, misogyny or intolerance of any kind.\u201d  Sturgeon\u2019s office said she used Friday\u2019s call to emphasize the \u201cvalues Scotland and the United States share.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team described the conversation as a \u201cshort congratulatory call.\u201d  Mr. Trump brimmed with optimism during his two rallies, eager to begin implementing his agenda.  Come January, Mr. Trump told the crowd in Michigan: \u201cThe American people will be in charge. Your voice, your desires, your hopes, your aspirations, you will never again fall on deaf ears.\u201d  He rattled through some of the major themes of his campaign, vowing to renegotiate faulty trade deals, repair roads and bridges and \u201cbuild a wall\u201d to guard against unlawful immigration.  \u201cWe have people coming into our country by the thousands, thousands and thousands of people and now I don\u2019t have to campaign so I don\u2019t have to say Hillary\u2019s going to increase it by 550 percent,\u201d Mr. Trump said in Baton Rouge. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have to say it anymore. Isn\u2019t it nice?\u201d  Mr. Trump\u2019s day also included a meeting at his New York City tower with House Speaker Paul Ryan to discuss policy priorities.  \u201cWe are really excited about getting to work and hitting the ground running in 2017,\u201d Ryan said after the morning meeting.  Meanwhile, there apparently is a split over the next head of the Republican National Committee. Current chairman Priebus is heading to the White House to be chief of staff.  Priebus is said to support Michigan Republican Party chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel for the post, though other senior officials are backing Nick Ayers, an aide to Vice President-elect Mike Pence. McDaniel addressed the Michigan crowd before Mr. Trump took the stage but no RNC announcement was made.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "LONDON - Conciliatory comments from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the aftermath of his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton helped global stock markets erase a large chunk of their earlier losses Wednesday. Though uncertainty remains over Trump\u2019s trade, immigration and geopolitical policies, investors appeared somewhat soothed by his victory speech, in which he praised Clinton and urged Americans to \u201ccome together as one united people\u201d after a deeply divisive campaign. When  it first became apparent that Trump was surging to victory following a run of  triumphs in key swing states, predictions about the open on Wall Street  were extremely negative. The Dow Jones industrials was forecast to open some 800 points  lower. But following a fairly measured victory speech by the president-elect, the Dow is now  anticipated to open down 360 points, or 2 percent. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s conciliatory acceptance speech, which suggests that he can be a more statesmanlike President rather than the demagogue of the election campaign, has helped to reverse some of the initial sell-off in equities in the immediate aftermath of his shock triumph,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist, in a note. In Europe, Germany\u2019s DAX was down 0.7 percent at 10,408 while the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.1 percent lower at 6,838. U.S. stocks are expected to open lower, too, though by far less than earlier predicted. Dow futures are 1.7 percent lower at 17,974 while the broader S&P 500 futures were down 1.8 percent at 2,097. As Trump gained the lead in the electoral vote count, investors became increasingly uneasy and share prices tumbled in Asia, which were open during the election results. Dow futures were down 4 percent at one point. However, by the time Trump was confirmed the winner and made his speech, financial markets had steadied. \u201cThere\u2019s scope to applaud the fact that the opening bell will come with the certainty of who the next president will be, but given the lack of detail on an economic policy agenda, investors will unsurprisingly still be feeling wary,\u201d said Remo Fritschi, Institutional Sales Manager at ADS Securities London. The dollar also recouped some ground, while assets that many investors search out at times of uncertainty, such as gold and the Swiss franc, came off earlier highs. An ounce of gold was up 2.4 percent at $1,305 while the dollar was only 0.4 percent lower at 0.9734 Swiss franc. One currency that remains heavily sold is the Mexican peso. It was down 8.5 percent as the prospect of a wall along the United States\u2019 southern border - a key campaigning point for Trump - has come one step closer to reality. Trump has insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall. Also potentially impacting the peso is Trump\u2019s threat to rip up trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, a key plank in Mexico\u2019s economic strategy and growth. \u201cIf Trump is able to follow through with these suggestions, Mexican activity will suffer greatly,\u201d said Jane Foley, senior foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank International. Under the U.S. constitution, Trump doesn\u2019t formally take the reins of power until January but he will begin the transition to his presidency almost immediately. In the coming weeks, investors will be looking to see if he further tempers some of the rhetoric that polarized American opinion and often spooked investors in financial markets. Trump\u2019s victory could make the U.S. Federal Reserve less likely to raise its key interest rate at its next meeting in mid-December - especially if financial markets remain under pressure. Some analysts are ruling it out entirely. \u201cLess chance of a Fed rate hike also helps keep investors smiling at the prospect of cheap money and accommodative global monetary policy stance for a while longer,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, an analyst at Accendo Markets. Another point of interest will center on the U.S.\u2019s trade relations with China and its impact across Asia. Trump\u2019s victory has raised concerns that the U.S. and China might embark on a trade war of sorts and that protectionism around the world will grow. In Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 stock index closed 5.4 percent lower, recouping some losses, at 16,251.54. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng closed 2.2 percent lower to 22,415.19 while the main index in Shanghai fell 0.6 percent to 3,128.77. \u201cInvestors will right now be in the process of attempting to differentiate between Trump\u2019s actual policy positions and some of the more outlandish statements made on the campaign trail,\u201d said Michael Levy, an emerging markets investment director at Barings. \u201cMarkets tend to assume the worst and react immediately, and that appears to be happening,\u201d said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. \u201cThere will be significant pressure for Mr. Trump to start to clarify some of his policy intentions, after which we may see a recovery as we did with Brexit.\u201d \u00a0 South Korea\u2019s trade ministry held an emergency meeting to review prospects of U.S. trade policies after the presidential elections. Top officials from Japan\u2019s central bank and finance ministry met Wednesday to discuss how to cope with the gyrations in financial markets.\u00a0 Japan\u2019s Deputy Finance Minister Masatsugu Asakawa said speculative movements were at work in the currency markets. \u201cWe will take necessary steps if speculative actions continue,\u201d Asakawa said.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats are turning to Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Brooklyn-bred partisan infighter with a pragmatic streak, to steer them into the Donald Trump era. Republicans are sticking with the genteel Kentuckian, Sen. Mitch McConnell, who lacks Schumer\u2019s instinct for soundbites but has been a brutally effective legislative tactician. Senate Democrats elected Schumer Wednesday morning as the new Democratic leader, succeeding Harry Reid, who\u2019s retiring. They also re-elected Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois as Senate Minority Whip and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington as assistant Democratic leader.\u00a0 Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan will serve as chairwoman of the Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mark Warner of Virginia will serve as vice chairs of the conference.\u00a0 Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will serve as chairwoman of the Steering Committee and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, will serve as chairman of outreach.\u00a0 These are the following ranking members of committees that were elected: Agriculture:\u00a0Senator Debbie Stabenow Armed Services:\u00a0Senator Jack Reed Appropriations:\u00a0Senator Patrick Leahy Banking: Senator Sherrod Brown Budget:\u00a0Senator Bernie Sanders Commerce:\u00a0Senator Bill Nelson Energy:\u00a0Senator Maria Cantwell EPW:\u00a0Senator Tom Carper Finance:\u00a0Senator Ron Wyden Foreign Relations:\u00a0Senator Ben Cardin HELP:\u00a0Senator Patty Murray HSGAC:\u00a0Senator Claire McCaskill Indian Affairs:\u00a0Senator Tom Udall Judiciary:\u00a0Senator Dianne Feinstein Rules:\u00a0Senator Amy Klobuchar Small Business:\u00a0Senator Jeanne Shaheen Veterans Affairs:\u00a0Senator Jon Tester Aging:\u00a0Senator Bob Casey Ethics:\u00a0Senator Chris Coons Intelligence:\u00a0Senator Mark Warner JEC:\u00a0Senator Martin Heinrich Senate Republicans re-elected McConnell as their leader. In the House, Republicans voted Tuesday to re-nominate Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., after recalcitrant conservatives and Trump backers upset by Ryan\u2019s frigid campaign-season treatment of Trump fell into line. Democrats postponed their leadership election until Nov. 30 after junior lawmakers demanded more time to digest the party\u2019s disappointing Election Day showing, a warning shot at House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. McConnell opened the Senate\u2019s first session of the lame-duck Congress calling for unity. \u201cWe\u2019re not Democrats first. We\u2019re not Republicans first. We are Americans first,\u201d said McConnell, who early in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency said his goal was to limit him to one term. Schumer, 65, has been No. 3 Senate Democratic leader and is a confidante of Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., departing after a three-decade career in the chamber. Schumer has a history of being a savvy partisan combatant willing to strike compromises, such as on a 2013 bipartisan immigration overhaul that ended up dying. Schumer is vaulting past No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin of Illinois and will lead Democrats\u2019 last line of defense against the Trump White House and GOP-controlled House. Senate Democrats - outnumbered 52-48, including two independents who back Democrats - could prevent McConnell from getting the 60 votes he\u2019ll need on some important issues. Schumer has said he\u2019ll seek opportunities to work with Trump but will face pressure from disappointed Democratic activists to adopt a hard line. It\u2019s unclear how he\u2019ll balance the demands of progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., against red-state senators facing re-election in 2018 and needing protection from politically damaging votes. McConnell, 74, was Senate minority leader for eight years before the GOP took control of the chamber for 2015 and 2016. He\u2019s widely backed among Republicans. He\u2019s pushed a conservative agenda while cutting budget deals with the Obama administration, and boldly refused to let the Senate consider Obama\u2019s nomination of federal judge Merrick Garland to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that occurred last February. That move paid dividends when Trump was elected. On Tuesday, House Republicans re-nominated Ryan by unanimous voice vote. Ryan will need 218 votes - a majority - to be approved when the full, new House convenes Jan. 3. With the GOP on target to have 241 seats next year, Ryan can afford just 23 defectors, but many Republicans expect Ryan to be safe in the GOP afterglow of Trump\u2019s win. Aiding Ryan: Support from Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, which Ryan and others underscored to Republican lawmakers before they voted. \u201cThe momentum is with us,\u201d Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said in an interview after nominating Ryan during Tuesday\u2019s closed-door meeting. \u201cThe last thing we need is to distract attention right now with a leadership fight. We\u2019re all pulling in the same direction.\u201d Mulvaney is in the tea party-leaning House Freedom Caucus, which has frequently rebelled against GOP leaders. Freedom Caucus leader Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said that while he expected Ryan to be elected speaker, \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d during the lame-duck session with Ryan\u2019s handling of spending bills and rules giving rank-and-file lawmakers more power. At a meeting of House Democrats Tuesday, Pelosi told her colleagues \u201cwe\u2019ve been through hell\u201d with the election and that Democrats should draw contrasts with Trump, according to an aide in the room. But all were not happy. \u201cEverything\u2019s not good. Business as usual is not going to work,\u201d said Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., among those who pushed for the delayed leadership vote.",

            "article_content": "Vice President-elect Mike Pence worked Sunday to reassure people that Donald Trump\u2019s web of businesses will not pose a conflict of interest for him when he takes office in January, saying there will be \u201cproper separation.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very confident that the president-elect and his extraordinary talented family are going to work with the best legal minds in this country and create the proper separation from their business enterprise during his duties as President of the United States,\u201d Pence told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d  In the days since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, there\u2019s been concern that he is not taking the necessary steps to separate his business interests from his service in the White House. Mr. Trump has declared that his adult children will take over running his business empire, rather than putting things in a blind trust as past presidents have done.  The New York Times reported that Trump met last week with Indian business partners building a Trump-branded apartment complex in Mumbai, further prompting concerns about conflicts of interest. And his daughter, Ivanka Trump, sat in on Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in New York last week, raising questions about how involved she will be in White House business. Raising further eyebrows, the Washington Post reported that Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel held a post-election reception for foreign diplomats to pitch them on the hotel and its amenities. Asked whether foreign companies that do business with Trump\u2019s companies will be disclosed, Pence would not say -- but said the laws concerning the issue will be \u201cstrictly adhered to.\u201d  \u201cAll of the laws pertaining to his business dealings and his service as President of the United States will be strictly adhered to and he\u2019s set that tone from the very beginning,\u201d Pence said. Pence, who has removed all lobbyists from the transition team, would not say that lobbyists will not be allowed to work in the White House. \u201cAs you know we made changes as soon as I took over the transition efforts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made changes -- we moved lobbyists out of the transition team and that\u2019s going to continue to be a lodestar and I can tell your viewers that the president-elect is determined to move ethics reform in the next year in the Congress of the United States.\u201d Asked again to clarify whether lobbyists would be allowed to serve in the administration, Pence replied that Mr. Trump \u201cmade clear \u2026 we are going to have people in the administration who are 100 percent focused on serving the American people and moving the Trump agenda forward.\u201d Pence said the first item on Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda will be repealing the Affordable Care Act -- a comment in seeming contradiction with Mr. Trump, who told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last week that he was open to amending the law instead and favored keeping certain provisions of Obamacare in place.  \u201cThe president-elect has already made the decision in conversations with Republican leaders in the House and Senate that we\u2019re going to lift the extraordinary burden of Obamacare off the backs of the American people and off the backs of American businesses,\u201d Pence said. \u201cRepealing Obamacare will be the first priority in a session that will be characterized by tax reform, rebuilding the military, infrastructure, ending illegal immigration and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.\u201d Pence also confirmed that 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who met with Trump in New Jersey yesterday, is under consideration as Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state. He said it was \u201cyet to be seen\u201d whether there would be any additional cabinet announcements on Sunday. \u201cWe spent the better part of an hour together with him, and then I know that the two of them actually had some private time together,\u201d Pence said. \u201cI would tell you that it was not only a cordial meeting but also it was a very substantive meeting, and I can say that Gov. Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as Secretary of State of the United States.\u201d As for the question of whether Trump\u2019s administration will reintroduce the use of waterboarding, an issue on which Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) sharply criticized Mr. Trump at a security conference over the weekend, Pence replied by just noting that Mr. Trump has made clear he will focus on the fight against ISIS. \u201cPresident Donald Trump is going to focus on confronting and defeating radical Islamic terrorism as a threat to this country,\u201d Pence replied. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a president again who will never say what we\u2019ll never do. In President-elect Donald Trump you have someone who believes that we shouldn\u2019t be telling the enemy what our tactics or our strategies are.\u201d Again, asked to follow up and clarify whether the Trump administration would pursue a return to waterboarding tactics, Pence replied: \u201cWell I think the President-elect made his views on that quite clear during the course of the campaign, but as we go forward what I can tell you is it\u2019s not going to be about a specific tactic.\u201d The vice president-elect also addressed the controversy over his attendance at the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d Friday night, where audience members booed him and cast members spoke directly to him from the stage at the end of the show. \u201cI wasn\u2019t offended by what was said, I\u2019ll leave to others whether it was the appropriate venue to say it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to assure people who were disappointed in the election results, people who are feeling anxious about this time in the life of our nation, that President-elect Donald Trump meant exactly what he said on election night, that he is going to be the president of all the people of the United States of America.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

When Trump promised that voting day would be like Brexit \u201cplus plus plus,\u201d he wasn\u2019t just predicting a surprise victory, but a chance to shake up the establishment. And CBS News correspondent Charlie D\u2019Agata says the shockwaves are already being felt around the globe.\u00a0 From Tokyo to London, the stunned world awoke to the results of a U.S. election more closely watched than any in modern history. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m a bit lost for words,\u201d one Londoner said on his way to work Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve been up since 4:30 actually, watching the election results. It\u2019s not so much of a surprise after what happened with Brexit here, you know.\u201d\u00a0 Though America\u2019s next commander-in-chief has bad-mouthed NATO, slamming allies for not ponying up their fair share, the NATO Secretary General was willing to let that slide.\u00a0 \u201cI look forward to working with him,\u201d Jens Stoltenberg said. \u201cOur alliance has brought together our closest friends for almost 70 years.\u201d\u00a0 Seventy years or not, European allies like French President Francois Hollande stood ready to call Trump out, saying \u201ccertain positions taken during the American campaign must be confronted.\u201d That, from a man who said Trump\u2019s \u201cexcesses made him want to retch.\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- who has come under blistering attacks over her immigration policies -- said Trump\u2019s victory featured \u201cconfrontations that were difficult to bear.\u201d The bottom line seems to be that global leaders who were baffled by Trump\u2019s statements during the campaign, now wonder whether that was just bluster, or a new direction in U.S. foreign policy.  As one German government minister put it, \u201cthe world won\u2019t end, but it will get a whole lot crazier.\u201d\u00a0",

Billions of dollars are riding on this projection, but of course, that doesn\u2019t guarantee it will happen.\u00a0 Clinton, viewed among investors as the status quo candidate, seems less inclined to take wild steps that would upset the markets.

Her deliverance during the weekend from more FBI trouble over her email has given markets new heart, and they rallied on Monday after a swoon of more than a week. Disrupting the status quo is the watchword of her Republican rival, Donald Trump, to the dismay of the investment community. He promises draconian crackdowns on trade and immigration, and he upsets many with his take-no-prisoners style. \u201cCombined with his nontraditional campaign persona, Clinton represents a more known and welcomed outcome,\u201d wrote Jason Pride, director of investment strategy with asset manager Glenmede, in a report. Wall Street analysts widely believe that, if Trump is victorious, the result would be a stock market bloodbath. Macroeconomic Advisers has predicted that a Trump triumph would shave 7 percent off the S&P 500 stock index, wiping out more than $1 trillion in market value.\u00a0 Certainly, a Clinton win is hardly a forgone conclusion. Many polls put her in the lead, but not by wide margins. The latest\u00a0CBS News poll shows Clinton at 45 percent and Trump at 41 percent. In the 1980 match-up between incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter and GOP challenger Ronald Reagan, the polls were tight throughout the fall, with the final Gallup survey showing 47 percent for Reagan and 44 percent for Carter. On Election Day, though, Reagan won handily, 51 to 41 percent. \u00a0 For the moment, however, markets are signaling their expectation that Clinton will be the next president: Stocks. In the wake of her FBI exoneration over the weekend, the market\u2019s Monday rally erased much of the nine-day slide it suffered through last Friday, the longest losing streak since December 1980. During those nine trading sessions, the S&P 500 slumped 3 percent. The 2.2 percent advance on Monday, to 2,131, is within hailing distance of the most recent high on Oct. 24, of 2,151. The nine-day market descent gained impetus following FBI Director James Comey\u2019s Oct. 28 bombshell announcement that the bureau was examining a new trove of emails that might be relevant to its earlier investigation of Clinton\u2019s private email server. But the stock retreat was hardly a rout.\u00a0As Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to financial services giant Allianz, put it in a commentary, the drop was a \u201cremarkably orderly and gradual repricing of risk on account of higher political uncertainty ... for a high probability Hillary Clinton victory.\u201d Accompanying the recent downdraft was a surge in the so-called fear gauge, a.k.a. the CBO Volatility Index or VIX. But once Comey cleared Clinton on Sunday, the VIX did an about-face, as well. It had climbed from 13 on Oct. 24 to 22 last Friday, then slipped back to 18.7 on Monday.\u00a0 Markets around the world rose Monday. For example, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, which had been drooping for five days, scored a 1.7 percent gain, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei, also off for five days, rose 1.6 percent. Election markets. These bourses, where people wager on who\u2019ll prevail on Election Day, display an overwhelming belief that Clinton will take the White House. Predictit gives Clinton 82 percent odds of winning, and the Iowa Electronic Markets finds her chances of victory at 80 percent. The two-party vote breakdown for the candidates is 53-46 percent, favoring Clinton, the Iowa group says. The odds are similar for the three betting sites based in the British isles: Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and Betfair.\u00a0 Mexican peso. While the U.S. dollar enjoyed an upturn versus world currencies on Monday, the conspicuous exception was the Mexican peso. It gained almost 2 percent over the weekend, after the Comey news, amid perceptions that Trump would not become president. From Trump\u2019s announcing his candidacy in 2015 to the current day, the Republican nominee has slammed Mexico as a foe, complaining that its illegal immigrants were criminals and that it lured U.S. manufacturing jobs south of the border, harming American workers.\u00a0 Trump has proposed slapping a 35 percent tariff on Mexican goods, which would hurt its economy. Nearly 80 percent of Mexico\u2019s exports go to the U.S. With a GDP of $18.5 trillion, the U.S. has the globe\u2019s largest economy, dwarfing that of Mexico ($1.1 trillion, 15th place).\u00a0 Gold.\u00a0The price of gold tracks Clinton\u2019s political fortunes well lately, and those of economies from Britain to China. The ultimate refuge investment when economic turmoil looms, or appears to, gold fell almost 2 percent on Monday. The yellow metal had pushed upward in price for much of the year, due to fears about slowing international economies and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, as well as improving prospects that Trump would gain the Oval Office. The kiddie poll. Up to now, perhaps the most unerring predictor is the straw vote of students at the Benjamin Franklin Elementary School\u00a0in Yorktown Heights, New York. The youngsters have correctly called the presidential election outcome since the school opened in 1968. Kids from kindergarten to fifth grade study the candidates\u2019 stances on issues, avoiding personalities and poll showings, then cast mock ballots. A possible reason for the kid vote\u2019s accuracy may be the school\u2019s diverse makeup, with pupils from a variety of ethnic and economic backgrounds.\u00a0 The school\u2019s tally for this year\u2019s election: Clinton beats Trump, by 52 to 43 percent.

At a news conference Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke about allegations that an off-duty Muslim police officer was threatened by a man who told her to \u201cgo back to her country.\u201d  Asked if he thought Trump was to blame for an increase in similar incidents, the mayor said \u201cIt\u2019s obviously more complicated than that. It is not linear.\u201d  But he accused Trump of using \u201chate speech\u201d and saying \u201chorrible things\u201d about Muslims.  Police in New York have logged 43 possible hate crimes since Trump\u2019s election, double the number during the same period last year.\u00a0 Also on Monday, officials said a New York City transit worker who is Muslim was pushed down the stairs at Grand Central Terminal by a man who called her a terrorist. Trump has denied that his proposals on immigration and restrictions on Muslims entering the U.S. amounted to hate speech. In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Mr. Trump told people who were committing violence in his name to \u201cstop it.\u201d Mr. Trump is living in New York City until Inauguration Day.

On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to quickly terminate his predecessor\u2019s immigration executive actions.  More than 20 law enforcement agencies including the FBI are working to track down the man accused of shooting two Georgia police officers yesterday, killing one of them. Minguell Lembrick allegedly opened fire when police responded to a domestic dispute call, and\u00a0he is now a wanted man.  The U.S. economy has expanded enormously in recent decades, even accounting for periodic recessions and financial crises. Despite that growth, fully half of Americans have failed to share in the country\u2019s economic gains, underlining the financial divide that was so evident during the presidential election. Donald Trump is going after the local union leader who represents Carrier employees, tweeting that Chuck Jones did \u201ca terrible job representing workers.\u201d Jones, the president of the United Steelworkers 1999, initially welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s deal with Carrier\u2019s parent company to keep some jobs in the U.S., but he later said Mr. Trump had \u201clied his a** off\u201d about the agreement.

Although Donald Trump has angrily accused China of deliberately devaluing its currency to gain an economic edge, another Asian country is arguably more deserving of that charge: Taiwan.

            "article_content": "I\u2019ve been thinking about this election for a while now like it\u2019s the final round of a game show. You\u2019ve won, and the host presents you with two options: a refrigerator and a mystery box.  The fridge is a fridge \u2013 you pretty much know what you\u2019re going to get. It might not be the best fridge. Maybe it\u2019s a bad one. You probably like your current fridge more. But it\u2019s something.  Then there\u2019s the mystery box. You have no idea what\u2019s in it. Maybe there\u2019s gold in it. Maybe it\u2019s filled with spiders. In any event, it\u2019s certainly the more exciting option, which is why the contestant so often picks it.\u00a0 So America has chosen the mystery box, and now we get to find out what\u2019s in it. And the first thing we\u2019re going to find out is how interested Trump is in actually doing the things a president does.  The often-heard theory from liberals over the last few months was that Trump didn\u2019t want to be president. Clearly he did, and he worked very hard for it. But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t be happy to outsource much of the day-to-day stuff that\u2019s not glamorous or fun.  A data point to consider here: According to the The New York Times\u2019 Robert Draper, Trump pretty much told John Kasich he could run the country if he\u2019d be his running mate.  Donald Jr. was reportedly the one to make the offer, and said that his father\u2019s vice presidential candidate \u201cwould be in charge of domestic and foreign policy.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, would be in charge of \u201cmaking America great again.\u201d\u00a0 Who knows if a similar deal was made with Mike Pence. But it would make a degree of sense, given what we know about Trump his enthusiasms. You could see him easily gliding into the role of the boss \u2013 the decider, if you will \u2013 who is still comfortable with outsourcing a lot of what he does.\u00a0 It\u2019s likewise easy to envision Trump spending a lot of time at the southern border in a hard hat talking about (and perhaps ultimately building) his wall. It might be safe to assume that they\u2019ll be other big infrastructure undertakings that Trump will make visiting a priority, in addition to big deals to be made at various international summits. He\u2019ll get the attention and the press doing something he\u2019s comfortable with and enjoys doing. This arrangement also would make sense for Trump because he\u2019s not really one for ideology, and he certainly isn\u2019t a policy wonk. Pence is by all means an ideologue, and one known and liked by the Republican ideologues set to run Congress.  Together, they would do what normal parties try to do while in power: force through an agenda, one that probably won\u2019t be too distinct from the once the GOP has pushed for decades. But let\u2019s allow that it also have certain Trumpian quirks, such as tariffs and that aforementioned wall.  That\u2019s not to say that a Trump presidency will be anywhere near normal. The one thing we know, in fact, is that it won\u2019t be, given his eccentricities and those of his kitchen cabinet: Newt Gingrich, Michael Flynn, etc.  But it\u2019s more than that. We don\u2019t know how loyal Paul Ryan, an immigration proponent and fiscal wonk, will be to him. We don\u2019t know what will happen to the various conservative think tanks that have spent decades churning out policy papers Trump is unlikely to agree with. The GOP could still easily break apart.  We have no idea if he can actually fashion together some kind of governing coalition, or if his sky-high negatives will lead many in his party to keep him at arm\u2019s length. We don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll spend much of time trying to settle old scores.\u00a0 We don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to recruit top-level advisors and experts to fill out his administration, or if he even wants to. The technocrats who usually have such sway in any administration might be pushed aside entirely for a gallery of amateurs and loyalists \u2013 such as the ones who just pushed his ramshackle barely-campaign across the finish line.  We don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll stumble into a Constitutional crisis within hours of taking the oath of office.  That\u2019s all an invitation to a great degree of risk and uncertainty. Part of why it might be smart for Trump to let Pence manage things behind the scenes then, is that if it\u2019s understood that the vice president calls a lot of the shots, and that that vice president is trusted by the GOP, it promises some degree of predictability and continuity.  That will be an asset for President Trump for at least the first few months. Mystery can be alluring, but chaos makes people nervous, and less likely to go along with whatever big ideas he\u2019ll have. It also makes markets nervous, and the last thing President Trump would need is some sort of stock crash or mass exodus of capital.  It\u2019s a tricky business, predicting what Trump will do and why he\u2019ll do it. But Pence taking on a tremendously powerful role in the new administration just might be unavoidable. \u00a0 Will Rahn is a political correspondent and managing director, politics, for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Investors who initially turned bearish at the idea of Donald Trump occupying the White House are rediscovering their bullish streak.\u00a0 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high on Thursday, shooting up 218 points, or 1.2, percent to end at 18,218. That topped the Big Board\u2019s last record-high on August 15, when it closed at 18,636 points.\u00a0 Banks and other financial companies led U.S. stocks mostly higher in afternoon trading Thursday. Consumer-focused companies, utilities and technology stocks were among the biggest decliners. The market was coming off a big rally following the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. Financial markets are rising on speculation that the Trump administration, backed by the Republican-controlled Congress, will ramp up public spending, as well as cut personal and corporate taxes, as he pledged during the presidential campaign.\u00a0 Investors think Trump \u201cwill have more success in implementing his domestic policy agenda in light of the Republicans\u2019 retention of Congress,\u201d Capital Economics said in a note.\u00a0 The upcoming Trump presidency, which will commence on Jan. 20, triggered a strong rally on Wednesday that extended somewhat into trading Thursday. Traders were focusing on Trump\u2019s promises to boost U.S. economic growth through infrastructure spending and by cutting red tape, rather than uncertainties such as what he might do with trade agreements.  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index added 4 points to close at 2,167. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 42 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,209. Before the election, markets had been worried about a Trump presidency because his campaign promises carried few policy details, making him an unknown quantity compared with rival Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe had a gangbuster day yesterday; call it a Trump rally,\u201d said Doug Cote, chief market strategist for Voya Investment Management. \u201cToday we\u2019re having a little breather, a little rest, but the key thing that will also keep the market going is the S&P 500 corporate earnings for the third quarter are positive for the first time in six quarters.\u201d Banks and other financial companies got a boost amid speculation that a Trump presidency could result in higher interest rates and less government regulation. JPMorgan Chase climbed $2.78, or 3.8 percent, to $76.03. Goldman Sachs rose $6.75, or 3.5 percent, to $199.38. Wells Fargo gained $3.01, or 6.3 percent, to $51, while Discover Financial Services added $3.03, or 5 percent, to $63.32. Bond prices continued to fall, sending yields higher. Bond investors expect that Trump\u2019s plans to increase spending on infrastructure while also lowering taxes will lead to stronger economic growth and possibly inflation, both of which are bad for bonds.\u00a0 Benchmark U.S. crude was down 50 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $44.77 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was down 39 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $45.97 a barrel in London. The dollar has been fairly solid since Trump\u2019s victory. The U.S. currency rose to 106.66 yen from 105.84 yen on Wednesday. The euro was down to $1.0892 from $1.0930. The Mexican peso continued to weaken against the dollar. One dollar now buys 20.50 pesos, more than the 19.87 pesos it bought late Wednesday. Investors worry that Trump\u2019s anti-immigration stance and intention to repeal a trade pact with Mexico could hurt that country\u2019s economy.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign was filled with its fair share of controversy and shocking moments. From policy proposals to off-the-cuff comments, Trump managed to offend many minority groups. Now that he has reached the highest office in the land, the country is wondering what his message and agenda will actually be. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d will air an interview with the president-elect on Sunday night, his first major sit down since winning the election, to discuss just that. Some of his most contentious campaign topics have already been featured on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in his two appearances during the campaign. He spoke with Scott Pelley once in September 2015 when the campaign was just getting started, and with Lesley Stahl in July shortly after naming his Vice President, Mike Pence.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall and we\u2019re going to create a border. It\u2019s going to be a great wall and it\u2019s not going to be very expensive,\u201d Trump told Scott Pelley in September 2015. When Pelley asked how he would build and pay for it, Trump answered \u201cIt will be a real wall. It\u2019ll be a wall that works.\u201d And on the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., Trump told Pelley he planned to \u201cround them up\u201d in a \u201chumane way.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn\u2019t sound nice. But not everything is nice,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 Trump still promises to build the wall, and to make Mexico pay for it.\u00a0 Donald Trump\u2019s call to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States shocked people from across the political spectrum -- including his eventual vice president pick, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Pence had tweeted \u201cCalls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.\u201d But when the two spoke with Lesley Stahl in July, they were in agreement on the ban. \u201cWe have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of this country, and Donald Trump is right to articulate that view,\u201d Pence said. Trump doubled down on his ban. \u201cCall it whatever you want, change territories, but there are territories and terror states and terror nations that we\u2019re not gonna allow the people to come into our country. And we\u2019re gonna have a thing called \u2018extreme vetting.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 When it comes to defeating ISIS, Trump offered up a hands-off strategy in Syria. \u201cIf you look at Syria. Russia wants to get rid of ISIS. We want to get rid of ISIS. Maybe let Russia do it. Let \u2018em get rid of ISIS. What the hell do we care?\u201d he told Pelley. And in Iraq, Trump told both Pelley and Stahl he would put troops on the ground to fight ISIS. He went as far as to suggest he might declare war.\u00a0 \u201cNow look, we are going to get rid of ISIS, big league. And we\u2019re going to get rid of \u2018em fast. And we\u2019re going to use surrounding states. We\u2019re going to use NATO, probably. And we\u2019re going to declare war. It is war,\u201d he said in July. Trump has also said that he won\u2019t reveal too much of his plan, because he doesn\u2019t want to give away his strategy to the enemy. It\u2019s no secret that as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign went on,his attitude toward the media grew more and more hostile. Even back in September 2015, that relationship was already soiled. When Pelley questioned whether Trump\u2019s quick tendency to pick a fight means he has thin skin, Trump fought back. \u201cYou know, some of the media is among the worst people I\u2019ve ever met. I mean a pretty good percentage is really a terrible group of people. They write lies, they write false stories. They know they\u2019re false. It makes no difference. And frankly I don\u2019t call it thin-skinned, I\u2019m angry.\u201d Trump ran on an \u201canti-establishment\u201d platform, painting himself as an outsider. But in July, he told Stahl he used to consider himself part of it. \u201cI am a person that used to be establishment, when I\u2019d give them hundreds of thousands of dollars. But when I decided to run, I became very anti-establishment because I understand the system better than anyone.\u201d His pick of Mike Pence for Vice President, he said, was partially to encourage unity with those Republicans worried about his candidacy by picking someone who is \u201cvery establishment.\u201d Cydney Adams is a senior manager of social media for CBS News.

Maggiano\u2019s Little Italy posted an apology on its Facebook page Monday.\u00a0 On Friday night, Maggiano\u2019s in Friendship Heights was the inadvertent site of a protest that caused us to close our... The restaurant said it didn\u2019t realize it was hosting a banquet Friday for a group called the National Policy Institute, whose website says it advocates for the heritage and identity of those of European descent in the U.S.\u00a0 The post said the group made reservation at the last minute using a different name. The group was gathered in Washington for a conference and celebrated Republican Donald Trump\u2019s election.  A tweeted photo from former reality star Tila Tequila appeared to show people making a Nazi salute. Her account later seemed to have been suspended.\u00a0 \u00a0Maggiano\u2019s said it has donated its profits from the evening to the Anti-Defamation League.\u00a0 The\u00a0far right-wing group known as the alt-right\u00a0latched onto to the Trump campaign -- and some of its leaders say his victory has given them a big boost. \u201cHail Trump, hail our people, hail victory,\u201d was heard over the weekend at a meeting in Washington, D.C. A meeting of the National Policy Institute drew hundreds to the Ronald Reagan pavilion in Washington, CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan reported.\u00a0 Since 2008, the alt- or alternative-right movement lived mostly on obscure message boards online.\u00a0 It gained more attention after Trump hired\u00a0Steve Bannon\u00a0to run his presidential campaign in August. \u00a0 Bannon\u2019s Breitbart website is, among other things, seen as the\u00a0largest platform for the alt-right message\u00a0-- with more than 300 million views in the last month. Thirty-eight-year old Richard Spencer, who is president of the National Policy Institute, said he is enthusiastic about Bannon acting as the strategist for President-elect Donald Trump.\u00a0 \u201cBecause Breitbart has been an open place for a lot of ideas that I care about,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Bannon denies being alt-right. Its members are usually college-educated white males, with strong right-wing views. They are difficult to define because of the wide range of members \u2013 from those who believe that America will be great only when it looks out for itself, to those who believe in anti-immigration and white dominance.\u00a0 \u201cThey say instead of asking what\u2019s good for the world they ask what is good for us,\u201d explained Professor Thomas Main, a public policy professor at Baruch College in New York City. He has been following the movement for years.\u00a0 He said after the Great Recession, and with the country\u2019s increasing minority population, many white men began to feel left out of the political process. \u201cI think what happened is that all of those shocks to the system, in a lot of people, especially on the right say, \u2018gee our current way of thinking is not working for us, we need something new,\u2019\u201d said Main.\u00a0 What does Spencer say to people who call groups like his racist? \u201cThe word racist doesn\u2019t have any meaning anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically calling me a mean old guy.\u201d\u00a0 Does he discriminate against people because of the color of their skin? \u201cEveryone is discriminating in all sorts of things in terms of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI discriminate all the time \u2013 discriminating is living.\u201d\u00a0 Spencer said he opposes violence. He calls the election of Trump a step toward our new normal.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump was elected Tuesday on calls to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d that is Washington, D.C. -- but former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Trump will need to have a \u201cvery, very aggressive\u201d first year in office if he hopes to overcome the entrenched nature of the country\u2019s capital. \u201cThis is a city which if you don\u2019t shove it as hard as you can while you have momentum, they will surround you,\u201d Gingrich, who is a vice-chair of Trump\u2019s transition team, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation. \u201cI mean, the swamp doesn\u2019t want to be drained. And the swamp will just suck you in if you let it, so he needs to have a very, very aggressive first year.\u201d At a time when many Democrats worry Trump does not have the temperament to be president, or to deal with people who disagree with him, Gingrich said Trump\u2019s post-election conduct indicates \u201csteps toward stability and maturity.\u201d \u201cHis victory speech was very conciliatory, very much in the right direction. I think his visit to the White House was very respectful on both sides and I think encouraging in that sense,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cI think his meeting with Paul Ryan, and with Mitch McConnell, and the fact that he\u2019s integrating Mike Pence so thoroughly, which also happened with Cheney.\u201d \u201cI think all those things show you steps towards stability and maturity that are very, very encouraging,\u201d he continued. Gingrich said there\u2019s potential for Trump to compromise with congressional Democrats on certain issues, including infrastructure and tax reform -- and that for Trump, getting support from across the aisle on some legislation is important to their long-term success. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that Trump try to have as many Democrats as possible help him do this,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause one of the lessons of the Obama years is, if you do things that are big on a purely partisan basis, they\u2019re not stable. I mean, I think Trump wants to change America to make it great again for a generation, not just for eight years.\u201d That said, Gingrich noted that Republicans\u2019 victories weren\u2019t constrained to the White House -- and said the \u201cshift towards Republican government\u201d in the House and Senate as well as in state legislatures gives him the ability to confidently govern on Republican policies. \u201cFirst of all, he won. And he won pretty decisively in the Electoral College,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that the deeper thing is the Republicans won the House. They won the Senate. They won the governorships...most Republican governors in history. Most Republican state legislators in history. So if you look at the country, there\u2019s certainly a shift towards Republican government on a pretty big scale.\u201d Gingrich said he\u2019s not concerned about the fact that Trump lost the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. If the electoral system had been based on the popular vote, Gingrich said, Trump would have competed in large blue states like California -- and asserted that Trump could have picked up \u201cat least 2 million votes\u201d in California just by competing there. \u201cRemember, in 49 states, he had a 2,200,000 vote majority. And then there\u2019s California,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cWe don\u2019t compete in California. The current rules of the game, we\u2019re not going to carry California. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a sad cycle. They don\u2019t invest because they\u2019re not going to carry it. So they -- so it gets worse every year. If this had been a general election where -- where the total vote mattered, we\u2019d have competed in California.\u201d Gingrich also said the idea that Trump\u2019s rise was aided by racists and bigots in the \u201calt-right\u201d movement is \u201cgarbage.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is a mainstream conservative who wants to profoundly take on the left. The left is infuriated that anybody would challenge the legitimacy of their moral superiority. And so the left goes hysterical,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact is, you know, and you get this with all these smears of Steve Bannon. Steve Bannon is a naval officer. He was a managing partner at Goldman Sachs. He was \u2013 he was a Hollywood movie producer. You know, the idea that somehow he represents -- I had never heard of the alt-Right until the nutcakes started writing about it.\u201d As for Trump\u2019s agenda, Gingrich pointed to an interview Trump gave with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d -- in which he outlined his plan to deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes. \u201cWell, I think if you listen to the brief section you had from \u201860 Minutes,\u2019 there are going to be substantial deportations,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cThey\u2019re called criminals. I mean, 2 million people would be a lot of people to deport.\u201d  \u201cAnd if at the same time you gain control of the border, and if you pass a guest worker program, you\u2019d be a long way towards then three, or four, or five years from now dealing with the rest of the folks who are here without legal permission,\u201d Gingrich added. \u201cAnd I think by that stage we would have accommodated in some way.\u201d He said that whether Democrats who opposed his candidacy accept him as \u201clegitimate\u201d depends on whether those Democrats want the country to be \u201ca successful venture\u201d -- but said Trump shouldn\u2019t expect to get any help from the \u201chard left.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s a question of whether or not you want America to be a successful venture. And I think frankly if you\u2019re hard left, it\u2019s very hard to imagine why you\u2019re going to accommodate a Trump presidency,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, George W. Bush was attacked from day one by the hard left. Obama was attacked from day one by conservatives. We\u2019ve now been through 16 years of this siege warfare.\u201d Should Trump continue tweeting, something that has been central (and sometimes damaging) to his image as a candidate?  \u201cMy advice to that is to always have an editor,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201c... I mean, look, it\u2019s a technique for reaching 13 or 14 million people at no cost and gets him around the New York Times.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke face-to-face for what could be the last time on Sunday on the sidelines of an economic summit underway in Peru. The world leaders have spent much of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency at odds over a host of issues, and Putin spent the 2016 presidential campaign cheering for Obama\u2019s political rival, Donald Trump, who will take the Oval Office on January 20. Presidents Obama and Putin were seen chatting as reporters were allowed in briefly for the start of the opening session of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima. They stood off to the side together momentarily before shaking hands and then taking their seats around a table. Although their words weren\u2019t audible to journalists present, the White House said the conversation lasted four minutes and mostly focused on Syria. A White House official alter said Mr. Obama encouraged Mr. Putin to uphold his country\u2019s commitments under the Minsk deal aimed at ending the Ukraine conflict. The White House said Obama also called for U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to keep working in initiatives with other countries to lower violence in the Syria crisis and alleviate suffering. At the G-20 summit in China earlier this fall, Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin met to negotiate a ceasefire in Syria but weren\u2019t able to reach an agreement, with Mr. Obama\u00a0saying \u201cgaps in trust\u201d\u00a0between the U.S. and Russia were hindering discussions. Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin have long had a strained relationship. President-elect Trump\u2019s election has raised speculation and concern he might do less to challenge Russian aggression. Trump has spoken warmly about Putin, and vice versa. The American and Russian leaders aren\u2019t expected to have any formal meetings while both are in Peru. Trying to tie up loose ends of his foreign policy agenda, Mr. Obama on Saturday instead found world leaders more focused on someone else: Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Global hand-wringing over America\u2019s next president has taken much of the wind out of President Obama\u2019s final overseas trip. Adopting an altruistic tone, Mr. Obama has offered frequent reassurances that the U.S. won\u2019t renege on its commitments. Yet he\u2019s been at a loss to quell concerns fully, given new signals from Trump that he intends to govern much the way he campaigned.  Mr. Obama\u2019s visit to Peru, the last stop on his trip, has brought those concerns to the forefront: Much of Latin America is on edge about a potentially dramatic shift in U.S. immigration policy under Mr. Trump. And Asian leaders gathered in Lima for an Asia-Pacific economic summit are trying to game out what Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency will mean for trade with the world\u2019s largest economy. \u00a0",

Too many African-Americans have been left behind.\u201d  It proposes to change the condition of black communities by promoting school choice, reduction of crime, business tax cuts, financial reforms, stopping \u201ctrade deficits,\u201d ending illegal immigration, new infrastructure investment, protections for \u201cthe African American church\u201d and an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.  While much of Trump\u2019s plan already exists as part of his general legislative agenda, it also includes policies specific to inner cities, where he would ramp up law enforcement and look to increase investments. \u201cWe will also have tax holidays for inner-city investment and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe will empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement.\u201d  The president-elect\u2019s plan comes just as anti-Trump protesters have filled major urban areas in recent days, crowding the streets with some resulting in violence.\u00a0 According to election exit polls, the president-elect fared poorly among black voters, garnering just 8 percent of African-American support. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, in comparison, won 88 percent of the black vote.",

            "article_content": "U.S. equities climbed to new record highs on Friday in what\u2019s becoming a speculative fever following the surprise electoral victory of President-elect Donald Trump.  Also fueling the rally are seasonal tailwinds in play at this time of the year as well as portfolio shifts as investors pull money out of bonds (which have been hammered) and pour it into stocks. There simply seems to be no stopping the uptrend.  If anything is going to break this streak now, it\u2019s the looming Federal Reserve monetary policy decision on Dec. 14.\u00a0 Last week, the Dow Jones industrials index gained 3.1 percent, the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.6 percent as big-tech stocks like Apple (AAPL) joined the fray and the Russell 2000 small-cap index climbed 5.6 percent to bring its total gain to 16 percent since the election.  Smaller stocks have been in the vanguard, thanks to their increased exposure to U.S. customers, who are expected to benefit most from Trump\u2019s economic policies. And financial stocks have been getting a lift from higher long-term interest rates, which boost profit margins for banks.  Both investors and consumers are in a \u201choneymoon\u201d period right now with Trump. In just over a month, after the inauguration, the realities of governing will hit -- and the ebullience will fade as contentious issues like the need to raise the federal debt ceiling in March and the drag on the deficit from higher interest rates become clear.  That isn\u2019t to say the uptrend won\u2019t march on into 2017 (chart below). Just that the euphoria should give way to reasoned analysis. Trump\u2019s efforts to clamp down on immigration and open-border trade deals will likely pinch corporate profitability. Plus, his fiscal plans, all else equal, would double the national debt and won\u2019t start coming into effect, according to Goldman Sachs, until 2018.  For now, however, none of that matters.  Overbought technical conditions, red-hot sentiment and stretched equity market valuations? Those don\u2019t matter either, but they\u2019re warning signs for those looking to extend their long positioning.  The Bespoke Investment Group noted that the S&P 500 is well over two standard deviations above its 50-day moving average. The latest Investors Intelligence survey showed investors with bullish sentiment increased to 58.8 percent, the third reading in the \u201cdanger zone\u201d and nearing the 60-percent-plus peak seen when the market was topping in mid-2014. And Goldman Sachs pointed out that the median S&P 500 company trades at the 98th percentile of historical valuations.  Investors couldn\u2019t care less. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, another $600 million flowed into stocks last week, while $1.2 billion was pulled out of bonds. Financial stocks enjoyed their 11th consecutive weekly inflow. Energy stocks enjoyed their largest inflow in a year.  The only remaining catalyst that could trip up stocks before year-end is the upcoming Fed policy announcement on Wednesday, widely expected to feature another 0.25 percent interest rate hike as well as fresh guidance showing an aggressive pace of hikes in 2017.  Heading into the New Year, Merrill Lynch analysts worry that risks will increase markedly for investors. Trouble could start as soon as February as short-term bonds sell off, joining in the weakness seen in long-term bonds. That would result in a \u201cbear flattening\u201d of the yield curve that ushers in an era of higher growth/higher interest rates that drives higher market volatility. And it raises the risk of a \u201cbust,\u201d a la 1987, 1994, 1998 and 2008 as the Fed is forced to quickly tighten policy to prevent runaway inflation.

            "article_content": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Gov. Nikki Haley has developed a national reputation as a racial conciliator who led the charge to bring down the Confederate flag at the Statehouse and guided South Carolina through one of its darkest moments, the massacre at a black church. Now the 44-year-old American-born daughter of Indian immigrants is about to take her role as the state\u2019s healer-in-chief to a world stage, as U.N. ambassador. On Wednesday, Haley became the first woman and first minority chosen by President-elect Donald Trump for his Cabinet. If the Senate confirms her, she could find herself in the awkward position of being the international voice for an administration that has belittled the United Nations, promised to build a wall along the Mexican border and endeared itself to the alt-right movement, even though Trump has repudiated such groups. Haley may have offered a glimpse Tuesday of how she will approach the job. \u201cFaith with action and kindness and love will always take us where we want to go,\u201d the Republican governor said at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, where a white man gunned down nine black parishioners in June 2015. Haley drew wide praise for her leadership after the attack, as she conveyed the state\u2019s grief and successfully led calls to bring down the Confederate flag that had flown on the Statehouse grounds for 54 years. The shootings were motivated by \u201cpure hate,\u201d she said then, and will \u201cforever change the way I live my life.\u201d On Tuesday, churches across the state honored Haley\u2019s request for prayer vigils amid the nearly simultaneous murder trials of the defendant in the church massacre and a white former police officer accused of fatally shooting a black motorist in the back. Her handling of the racially charged events bolstered her national image, said longtime GOP operative Richard Quinn. \u201cIt became a national example of how you can deal with racial issues peacefully,\u201d he said. Other crises Haley has grappled with over the past two years include historic flooding in 2015, an elementary school shooting last September, Hurricane Matthew last month and wildfires that continue to rage in the state\u2019s northwestern corner. \u201cThe one constant is when things we didn\u2019t understand happened, the action was people stood hand in hand and loved each other. They didn\u2019t look for someone to blame, or hate. They looked for someone to love and lift people up,\u201d she said Tuesday, in calling for the same approach as the trials and the disaster recovery play out. Born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa in rural Bamberg, South Carolina, Haley was raised a Sikh. She says she converted to Christianity before marrying her husband, Michael, in 1996. They have two children, ages 18 and 15. Haley has recalled that as a youngster, she and her sister were disqualified from the segregated Little Miss Bamberg Pageant because organizers couldn\u2019t figure out whether the girls should compete in the white or the black contest. She confronted religious slurs over her Sikh roots during her 2010 campaign. The second-term governor, who can\u2019t seek a third term, was a Trump critic during the White House campaign. She asked Americans to resist \u201cthe siren call of the angriest voices\u201d in how the nation treats immigrants. But she has also fought the Obama administration on both legal and illegal immigration. Last December, she asked that no Syrian refugees be relocated to South Carolina because of \u201cgaps in available intelligence\u201d on those fleeing the civil war. Haley, the second U.S. governor of Indian heritage, is the first South Carolina governor who is not a white man. She is also the nation\u2019s youngest governor. She brings limited international experience to one of the U.S. government\u2019s most important international assignments. Almost all of her exposure on the world stage has been in pursuit of luring jobs to South Carolina. Michelin, Bridgestone, Continental, Trelleborg and Giti Tire all have announced new or expanded operations in recent years, bolstering South Carolina\u2019s reputation as the nation\u2019s tire capital. Her trips abroad to lure jobs include a 2015 secretive trip to Sweden, which was followed weeks later by an announcement that Volvo would build its first U.S. auto plant in South Carolina in exchange for more than $200 million in state incentives. In 2014, Haley took an economic development trip to India, her first visit to her parents\u2019 native country since she was 2. Her parents emigrated from India in the early 1960s. Haley graduated from Clemson University in 1994 with an accounting degree. But she says her business experience started at age 13, when she became the bookkeeper of her family\u2019s clothing store, a job she returned to after college. In 2010, she was a three-term state House member, little known across the state. Still, Haley won the GOP primary for governor that year against a South Carolina congressman, an attorney general and a lieutenant governor. She prevailed in the general election and was easily re-elected four years later.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has yet to nominate an individual to lead the State Department -- and the pitch to be the highest-ranking Cabinet member has become public for some. Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus added some names to the list of contenders Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press:\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure who he\u2019s going to select, but I do know that he\u2019s talking to the right people: Giuliani, General Keane, General [John] Kelly; he\u2019s talked to Mitt Romney, obviously.\u201d\u00a0 CBS News has reported that one of the top contenders is Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, but other possible picks include 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former CIA Director David Petraeus, and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, among others. Here\u2019s an overview of some of the individuals who might be picked: Rudy Giuliani:\u00a0The\u00a0Trump ally\u00a0has made a public case for his appointment, arguing that his private sector experience makes him a strong candidate.  \u201cI probably have traveled in the last 13 years as much as Hillary did in the years she was secretary of state,\u201d Giuliani, referencing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Friday. \u201cMy knowledge of foreign policy is as good, or better, than anybody they\u2019re talking to.\u201d He told the Journal that he had visited as many as 80 foreign countries since leaving public office and taken 150 foreign trips. He has spent the last several years consulting on security issues around the world for a firm he founded, Giuliani Partners, and he also chaired the cyber security and crisis management practice at Greenberg Traurig, a major multinational lobbying law firm. Some of Giuliani\u2019s business ties to foreign governments and companies would likely be scrutinized during Senate confirmation. The ex-mayor, 72, was also a federal prosecutor in the Reagan administration. Giuliani\u2019s aggressive demeanor has some Republicans worried about how he would conduct himself on a world stage. On CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d last week, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul criticized Giuliani for being \u201cunrepentant\u201d in supporting the Iraq war, and said he doesn\u2019t believe Giuliani is \u201cvery diplomatic.\u201d \u201cI think you want the chief diplomat to be diplomatic,\u201d said Paul, who has claimed he would vote against confirming Giuliani in the Senate if Mr. Trump nominated him. Mitt Romney: The former GOP presidential nominee has a history of clashing with the president-elect. Romney refused to endorse Mr. Trump during the Republican primary cycle, even actively and openly blasting the real estate mogul for his controversial rhetoric and policy stances.  Trump has also fired back against Romney, calling him a \u201clightweight losing candidate\u201d on Facebook and dubbing him \u00a0\u201cone of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics\u201d in a tweet.  But the two had a lengthy meeting at Bedminster which impressed Mr. Trump, and put him into \u201cactive and serious consideration\u201d for secretary of state. Kellyanne Conway, a senior transition team adviser and Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, weighed in over the Thanksgiving holiday about the possibility of Romney as chief diplomat, cautioning that the president-elect\u2019s supporters would not appreciate the choice.  One source told CBS News\u2019 Arden Farhi that he had received text messages from donors and allies who have warned against choosing Romney because he had been \u201cthrowing spears from the stand\u201d during the election cycle. \u00a0 David Petraeus: The president-elect has been giving serious consideration to Petraeus, whose resume includes his leadership of Central Command, his time as a retired Army general, and a stint as the former CIA director (a post he later resigned because of a scandal involving an extramarital affair and the improper handling of classified information, for which he was given two years probation and fined $100,000).  Petraeus\u2019 military background could fall in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to beef up American military strength abroad, and he has even called for a reexamination of restrictive U.S. rules of engagement when it comes to precision airstrikes.  Petraeus has also cautioned against putting boots on the ground with Iraqi forces when it comes to the fight against ISIS.  \u201cI would not, for example, embed U.S. personnel at the Iraqi battalion level, nor would I support clearance operations before a viable force is available,\u201d he said in an interview with \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d last year. Petraeus told BBC Radio 4 this week that if Mr. Trump appointed him to his Cabinet, \u201cthe only response can be: \u2018Yes, Mr. President.\u2019\u201d Bob Corker: The Tennessee senator, a Republican, is another possible candidate -- he currently chairs the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee, where he led the Senate fight against President Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal.\u00a0 Corker, who served on Mr. Trump\u2019s national security advisory committee during the campaign cycle, has also disagreed at times with the president-elect. Corker was a key player in the 2013 comprehensive immigration bill that passed in the Senate, where he authored an amendment pushing for a border security surge. The overall legislative package has been unpopular with Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.\u00a0 The Tennessee Republican criticized Mr. Trump during the primary campaign for statements saying that President Obama founded the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, saying the outlandish statement was \u201ctaking the facts that took place in 2011 and carrying that far too far.\u201d Corker was also on Mr. Trump\u2019s shortlist to become vice president. Marine Gen. John Kelly (ret), the former head of the Southern Command, met with Mr. Trump on Sunday, and as mentioned, he was among the names Priebus brought up on Sunday. Kelly served for 45 years in the military and is widely respected. He is credited with helping wipe out al Qaeda in western Iraq, and he also served as a military adviser to Robert Gates when he was defense secretary. Kelly has opposed Mr. Obama on several fronts, including his efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. He has also scoffed at the idea that a Senate report on the CIA\u2019s use of torture on detainees meant that the U.S. had lost the high moral ground on human rights -- it was \u201cfoolishness,\u201d he told the Washington Post. In the last couple of years, as the push to allow women into combat roles intensified, the Marines opposed opening all ground combat jobs to women. They had conducted a study which concluded that mixed-gender units were less effective that all-male units. Asked about this in January, Kelly predicted that there would be pressure for future generals \u201cto lower standards because that\u2019s the only way it\u2019ll work in the way that I hear some people, particularly, the agenda-driven people here in Washington -- or in the land, the way they want it to work.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this article misstated how Sen. Bob Corker voted regarding the Iran nuclear deal. He voted against the deal.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Wall Street roared back from the abyss on Wednesday in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s surprise electoral victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Overnight, equity futures had dropped several percent, echoing the Brexit chaos from June: An angry electorate out to punish the establishment was making markets recoil once again.  Yet the fear soon subsided. Trump\u2019s victory speech was conciliatory, Clinton conceded. And, most important for reversing the panic that set in on first blush, traders realized that if Trump\u2019s economic plans are enacted, they would amount to a huge fiscal stimulus of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, with a strong dose of deregulation for the financial industry and others. Equities soared, with the Dow Jones industrials index gaining 1.4 percent after testing new highs, thanks to big gains in bank stocks and other areas set to benefit from a Trump administration. The dollar surged. But a big sell-off in Treasury bonds, evidence of technical weakness, and a jump in long-term interest rates suggest challenges -- and ongoing market volatility -- lie ahead.  Treasury bonds were slammed on a spike in inflation expectations and chatter of official selling of U.S. bonds by the Chinese. Also, the December Federal Reserve interest rate hike seems to be on track as well. But that boosted financial stocks in a big way, up 4.1 percent as a group, on hopes that higher rates will lift loan profitability. \u00a0 Some health-care stocks were also strong on visions of a lighter regulatory burden on drugmakers and biotechs. The group gained 3.4 percent, with Pfizer (PFE) closing up 7.1 percent after trading even higher earlier in the session.  U.S. Steel (X) gained 17.2 percent, thanks to an analyst upgrade by Jefferies on post-election benefits from possible trade protectionism and increased infrastructure spending. Corrections Corp. of America (CXW) gained a whopping 43.1 percent as analysts noted possible higher demand if Trump tightens immigration enforcement. Clinton\u2019s defeat also removed the threat of her anti-private-prison stance. And Lockheed Martin (LMT) gained 6 percent on a general boost for defense stocks, thanks to Trump\u2019s clamoring for an upgrade to military hardware.  On the downside, emerging markets stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other yield-sensitive issues, and clean energy stocks underperformed.  Looking ahead, a lot remains in flux.\u00a0 Also, let\u2019s not forget that the first major policy challenge Trump will face is the need to raise the U.S. debt ceiling in March -- something that will focus attention on the deficit-raising consequences of his fiscal plans and put many Congressional Republican budget hawks in an awkward position.  Wednesday\u2019s flashy rebound in the stock market also masks underlying weakness because the rally was tainted by narrow participation. Incredibly, there were only 310 net advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange. That\u2019s down nearly 30 percent from Tuesday\u2019s modest rise on Wall Street. And it\u2019s well below the nearly 2,000 net advancing issues seen on Monday as markets surged in response to news the FBI had wrapped up its investigation into possible new emails related to Clinton\u2019s private server.  Complicating matters for investors amid all the uncertainty about Trump\u2019s policies is the fact that stocks are entering a time of seasonal strength (\u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d and all that).\u00a0 So until clarity on Trump\u2019s policy priorities emerges, the sell-off in T-bonds stabilizes, and the market fully digests the Fed\u2019s next rate hike, investors would do well to remain cautious. \u00a0 \u00a0 Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

            "article_content": "GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump delivered a huge electoral upset over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton with a surprisingly strong showing in \u201cRust Belt\u201d states thanks to his touting of economic nationalism to regions ravaged by the headwinds of free trade and globalization.\u00a0 Markets descended into chaos almost as soon as the close results from states like Florida, Ohio and North Carolina trickled in, sending Dow futures and Asian stock prices sharply lower as investors panicked over uncertainties on trade, immigration and geopolitical tensions. At one point, Dow futures plunged more than 4 percent and Japan\u2019s major index nosedived more than 6.1 percent, its largest drop in years. The Mexican peso likewise tumbled and investors looking for safe assets bid up the price of gold. Watch for a triggering of circuit breakers when U.S. markets open on Wednesday. The New York Stock Exchange\u2019s \u201cLevel 1\u201d breakers are hit on a 7 percent decline, which is a roughly 1,280-point drop for the Dow. It\u2019ll likely resemble the fallout from this past summer\u2019s Brexit all over again. Only bigger. And it\u2019ll likely continue.  Also crashing are the odds of the oft-teased December rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Assuming financial market pressure continues as New York markets open for business -- which is all but assured -- look for Fed officials to soothe nerves by downplaying chances of a policy tightening until financial market turmoil ends, as they did earlier this year in the wake of the Brexit uncertainty. Stepping back, the election result is a massive surprise (few pre-election polls showed Trump ahead in support) and a big electoral mandate for Republicans, who are on track to maintain control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The last time Republicans held all three branches of power (White House, Senate and House) was in 1928 when California Republican Herbert Hoover beat New York Democrat Al Smith.  It will surely have major implications for the drivers of the stock market: Earnings, economic growth and interest rates, as well as investor sentiment. For the last year and a half, Democrats and many Republicans have been using scare tactics to warn of the consequences of Trump rising to the presidency. So, the near-term panic is likely to be acute and powerful.  This is made worse by the technical fragility of the stock market: The Dow has been flirting with the 18,000 level since 2014, corporate earnings have been falling for a year-and-a-half, and the economy is tepidly running just above stall speed. The Russell 2000 small-cap stock index returned last week to levels not seen since early July before rebounding.  What comes after will depend, in large part, on Trump himself in the days and weeks to come. Who will be his cabinet picks? What tone does he set with China and Mexico on trade policies and his border wall? Will he reconcile with Fed chairman Janet Yellen? And let\u2019s not forget that Trump\u2019s economic policies amount to a massive fiscal stimulus since they would add to the national debt, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. This could be a much-needed boost to the economy, as tax cuts and infrastructure spending lift GDP growth.  Time will tell. But for now, wild market swings are likely as investors and traders respond to the world\u2019s largest democracy delivering a massive shock to the political and economic establishment.

            "article_content": "NEW YORK CITY -- Throngs of people supporting immigrant rights took to the streets in protest Sunday, just as mass deportation plans from President-elect Donald Trump were revealed during his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. The marches began in Manhattan on Sunday largely to protest against Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win, but the focus was on his immigration plans. More than 1,000 people joined the march that started mid-afternoon and extended into the evening. Demonstrators were holding signs in English and Spanish, saying things like \u201cHate won\u2019t make us great.\u201d They\u2019re chanting, \u201cWe are here to stay.\u201d Organizers have said they\u2019re speaking out against Trump\u2019s support of deportation and other measures. The areas surrounding the president-elect\u2019s Midtown home has become like a fortress, with the Secret Service and NYPD going to extremes to protect the future president, CBS New York reported. Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s most reliable surrogates, said protesters around the nation are exaggerating the fear of a Trump presidency. The former New York City mayor said he wishes that Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic presidential nominee, and President Barack Obama would say something to the protesters. \u201cI just hope it calms down,\u201d Giuliani said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Giuliani said the protesters should respect the democratic process and calls them \u201ckind of like professional protesters.\u201d Mostly, the demonstrations were peaceful. However, in Portland, Oregon, a man was shot and wounded Saturday morning during a confrontation. Police arrested two teenagers. Police in Portland say they arrested a total of 71 people late Saturday and early Sunday during the anti-Donald Trump protests downtown.  In a news release Sunday, the Portland Police Bureau said the protesters failed to obey numerous lawful orders to vacate city streets. Most were cited for disorderly conduct and failing to obey an officer.  The bureau called in a public transit bus to transport the arrested to the central police precinct for processing.  Police said protesters repeatedly threw road flares and bottles at officers and that a police sport-utility vehicle was tagged with graffiti. Several hundred protesters Sunday marched around Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall and then down Market Street to Independence Mall, carrying signs and chanting \u201cDonald Trump has got to go!\u201d and \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d In Los Angeles, a few hundred people gathered outside CNN\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters, and in San Francisco, hundreds of people, including many families with children, marched from Golden Gate Park to Ocean Beach chanting \u201cLove trumps hate!\u201d On Saturday, an estimated 8,000 marched through downtown.\u00a0 On Sunday, about 800 people marched through the state capital of Sacramento and hundreds others formed a human chain around the nearly 3.5-mile perimeter of Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt. Rallies in Oakland have at times become unruly, but those who came to the lake held hands and chanted, \u201cWe reject the president-elect.\u201d\u00a0 Demonstrations also took place internationally. On Saturday, a group of Mexicans at statue representing independence in Mexico City expressed their concerns about a possible wave of deportations. One school teacher said it would add to the \u201cunrest\u201d that\u2019s already in Mexico. About 300 people protested Trump\u2019s election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy near the landmark Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. On Saturday, demonstrators gathered in big cities like New York and Los Angeles, as well as in smaller places like Worcester, Massachusetts, and Iowa City, Iowa.",

A meeting of the National Policy Institute \u2013 an alt-right think tank \u2013 drew hundreds to the Ronald Reagan pavilion in Washington.\u00a0 Since 2008, the alt- or alternative-right movement lived mostly on obscure message boards online.\u00a0 It gained more attention after Donald Trump hired Steve Bannon to run his presidential campaign in August. \u00a0 Bannon\u2019s Breitbart website is, among other things, seen as the largest platform for the alt-right message\u00a0-- with more than 300 million views in the last month. Thirty-eight-year old Richard Spencer, who is president of the National Policy Institute, said he is enthusiastic about Bannon acting as the strategist for President-elect Donald Trump.\u00a0 \u201cBecause Breitbart has been an open place for a lot of ideas that I care about,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Bannon denies being alt-right. Its members are usually college-educated white males, with strong right-wing views. They are difficult to define because of the wide range of members \u2013 from those who believe that America will be great only when it looks out for itself, to those who believe in anti-immigration and white dominance.\u00a0 \u201cThey say instead of asking what\u2019s good for the world they ask what is good for us,\u201d explained Professor Thomas Main, a public policy professor at Baruch College in New York City. He has been following the movement for years.\u00a0 He said after the Great Recession, and with the country\u2019s increasing minority population, many white men began to feel left out of the political process. \u201cI think what happened is that all of those shocks to the system, in a lot of people, especially on the right say, \u2018gee our current way of thinking is not working for us, we need something new,\u2019\u201d said Main.\u00a0 What does Spencer say to people who call groups like his racist? \u201cThe word racist doesn\u2019t have any meaning anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically calling me a mean old guy.\u201d\u00a0 Does he discriminate against people because of the color of their skin? \u201cEveryone is discriminating in all sorts of things in terms of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI discriminate all the time \u2013 discriminating is living.\u201d\u00a0 Spencer said he opposes violence.

Are you really going to build a wall?  DONALD TRUMP: Yes.  LESLEY STAHL: You\u2019re-- you know, they are talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?  DONALD TRUMP: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I\u2019m very good at this, it\u2019s called construction.  LESLEY STAHL: So part wall, part fence?

But  we\u2019re getting them out of our country, they\u2019re here illegally. After the  border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to  make a determination on the people that they\u2019re talking about who are  terrific people, they\u2019re terrific people but we are gonna make a  determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley,  it\u2019s very important, we are going to secure our border.",

            "article_content": "I would love to join the chorus and say my jaw dropped when it was becoming apparent that Donald Trump was going to win on Election Night.  But the truth is that I still haven\u2019t picked it up from when Trump gave out Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s phone number in South Carolina (July 21st, 2015).  Or when he went on a long screed against Ben Carson, which culminated in him inviting an audience member to stab him and then asking how \u201cstupid\u201d the voters of Iowa are (November 21st, 2015).  Or when he repeated an audience member calling Sen. Ted Cruz a \u201cp**sy\u201d in New Hampshire in front of thousands (February 8th, 2016).  My mouth is still (hopefully not permanently) agape from when Trump called a statement by Pope Francis \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in South Carolina (February 18th, 2016). In that instance, I actually let out a gasp. It wasn\u2019t the first time. It certainly wasn\u2019t the last.  For visual evidence of my shocked face, see Trump\u2019s Facebook Live video on October 9th before the second general election debate. Trump shocked the nation when he held a news conference with Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers of alleged sexual misconduct through the decades.  As reporters filed in, there was my face, once the realization dawned on me as to what was happening, with eyes popping as if we had reached the peak action scene of Looney Tunes episode featuring Daffy Duck. \u00a0 I have this journal I\u2019ve kept since the beginning of the campaign. The first entry was before Trump announced. It has my weight. It was the first time I had weighed myself in awhile and I aimed to stay in shape on the trail. While I won\u2019t give you the specific number, I will say that following the number, my journal entry says \u201cYikes!\u201d  Let\u2019s leave aside whether a year and half of being on the road with only sporadic trips to the gym and never turning down that bag of chips helps with that. The first Trump-related entry was on July 16th, 2015. Trump gave a speech in Laconia, New Hampshire. The entry reads, \u201cSweltering hot\u2026room packed to the brim...\u201d Then there was Trump, unfiltered and with no teleprompter aiming a Trump-Tower sized verbal cannon at\u2026everything. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the problem with politicians,\u201d he said, voice rising. He controlled the room with an almost preacher-like quality. \u201cThat\u2019s all they do is debate. They go up. They debate. They\u2019re all talk. They\u2019re no action. Nothing happens ever! Nothing happens!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe have a president that doesn\u2019t have a clue!\u201d \u201cI have an expression. We have lots of expressions in this group, that I can tell you. Right? But I have an expression. The American dream is dead but I\u2019m going to make it better and bigger and stronger.\u201d \u201cWe need leadership that\u2019s smart! We have to bring back our jobs! We have to bring back our manufacturing from many countries! We don\u2019t make any good deals.\u201d  \u201cRemember, the silent majority is back. And don\u2019t forget it. This is the silent majority!\u201d Trump walked off stage. My journal reads, \u201cTrump mobbed on way out of the room...as if he was Paul McCartney from the Beatles in the 1960\u2019s. Maybe he is for GOP.\u201d When Trump said the \u201csilent majority\u201d is back, many scoffed. I think back to that Laconia rally and I wonder if Trump truly knew about what the fervency of his support \u2013 or what the media spectacle would be for the entirety of the campaign. I certainly didn\u2019t. The funny thing is that for the last 18 months, as the campaign reporter assigned to cover Trump for CBS, I have spent more time in the same room as Trump other than his own staff and family. But in that time, I never got to know the guy. I never found out what made him tick. I never had a full conversation with him, beyond press conferences or the occasional hello. He never hung out with his traveling press. The only time he would even acknowledge reporters was to call us dishonest at every turn at rallies and to turn crowds against us. One personal interaction I did have with him did give me some insight into who Trump was as a person. I just didn\u2019t realize it at the time. A couple weeks after Laconia, during a hot summer morning, a mass of cameras, journalists and bemused pedestrians crowded outside 60 Centre Street - New York\u2019s State Supreme Court. The court officer that\u2019s patrolled the court for almost forty years said he had never seen anything like this. I was there for CBS. A woman walked by a group of us -- when we were already irritated and drowning in sweat -- and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better to do?\u201d I wish I could time-warp back to that woman and say, \u201cLady, you have\u00a0no\u00a0idea.\u201d A photographer snapped back: \u201cYou stop watching this stuff, we\u2019ll stop taking pictures.\u201d Any second now, Trump was about to show up for jury duty. A woman walking out of the courtroom shook her head and muttered, \u201cThis isn\u2019t news. This is b******t.\u201d Trump was supposed to show up at 9:00 a.m., but pulled up in a stretch limo about seven minutes late. His long-time driver, Eddie Diaz, said that the car ran into some traffic on the way down. The limo pulled up to the court and out popped the future president-elect. Trump was instantly mobbed by cameras and reporters shouted questions at him. \u201cWill you deport 11 million undocumented immigrants?\u201d \u201cAre you excited for jury duty?\u201d Trump slowly and deliberately walked up the courthouse steps. He soaked in the media attention - occasionally throwing glib, one-sentence responses to ravenous reporters ready to gobble up any and all sound bites. I was stationed near the courthouse door. I was part of the pack - yelling questions. Trump, ever the showman, knew we needed to get our shots. He would stop occasionally to make sure. Trying to get the coolest kid in the area to pay attention was something I had done my whole life without success. As Trump got near my camera, he closed his eyes and flashed a thumbs up to my lens. Two men who wanted to get Trump to sign a dollar bill. They told me it could sell for $200 on Ebay. Trump came out and took a lunch break, still being mobbed by cameras on the way in and out. On his way back in, I asked him how he would feel about getting picked for a jury. He paused, weighing whether to grace me with a precious sound bite. He turned to me and said, \u201cIf it happens, it happens.\u201d \u201cIf it happens, it happens,\u201d was, in one way, the most banal phrase ever invented by man. It is a close relative of \u201cIt is what it is\u201d and \u201cBoth teams played hard, man.\u201d But on the other hand, it sums of the Trump candidacy in five words. Trump campaigned\u00a0his way, consequences be damned.  There was never a pivot to appeal to the masses. But he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 It was the Trump mindset. He could go to war with Fox News. He could insult veterans who were prisoners of war. He could propose a giant wall across the Southern border that would cost hundreds of billions of dollars - and then claim Mexican government would pay for it - and still be impervious to political gravity. Should Ukraine join NATO? This is what Trump told Meet The Press on August 16th, 2015: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care. If [Ukraine] goes in, great. If it doesn\u2019t go in, great.\u201d Hundreds of rallies later, I find myself thinking back to that Laconia rally and jury duty as very indicative of what the Trump candidacy would be like: The preacher-like bombast, and the swagger of his walk up the steps.\u00a0 And it worked. Now, there is no \u201cIf it happens, it happens.\u201d It happened. Trump is now the president-elect. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one I\u2019d even consider,\u201d 69-year-old Kit Carson, a lifelong Newport Beach resident once told me at a rally at the USS Iowa in Los Angeles, California more than a year ago. \u201cOur politicians are coercive crooks who live off of you and me.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMight as well not even be anybody else,\u201d said Bradley Herring, a 26-year-old firefighter I met at a rally in Franklin, Tennessee. He drove almost 10 hours to come see Trump. \u201cNot a politician, he\u2019s a businessman. He\u2019s rich. If he can build a billionaire empire, he can build a rich country.\u201d I met many people on the trail that agreed with Carson and Herring, the ones that thought Trump would change everything because he wasn\u2019t a politician. \u201cIt\u2019s like reading a book. How many times do you have to read\u00a0Gone With The Wind\u00a0before you know what happens?\u201d said 68-year-old Jane Williams at a rally in Richmond, Virginia. \u201cYou hear what they have to say. Canned, heard it before.\u201d In some respects, Trump had the election won just by announcing he was running, by sheer virtue of not being anybody else. But there was also a genuine, visceral dislike of Hillary Clinton. One interaction that always stands out to me was with a man named Sandy Woodmansee, a construction supervisor, who lives in Epping, New Hampshire.  He was volunteering for Trump at a rally in Keene in September, 2015. Woodmansee had a grizzled, white beard with a thick New England accent. He was sporting a buzz cut, a grey polo and shorts. He was a fast talker and his job was to patrol the parking lot. \u201cSTOP. YER NAWT ALLOWED TO BE IN HE-UH,\u201d he would say to drivers who had gone astray. No one needs a moat when you had Woodmansee. I asked Woodmansee why he had decided to volunteer for Trump. \u201cI was laying in bed, trying to sleep, and I don\u2019t know why, but I thought of the Clintons being back in the White House and it absolutely appalled. The very next day I volunteered to assist Donald Trump.\u201d Months later, Trump would have his first victory in New Hampshire, crushing the competition. Woodmansee spotted me across the room, walked up to me, grabbed me by the face and plopped a big kiss on my cheek. He then walked away without saying a word.\u00a0 There went my jaw again. Trump rallies were like political Woodstock for his supporters. People would drive for hours, stay overnight in front of an arena to get a good seat, dress up in costume and cry during their favorite Trump policy proposal. One time, at a rally in Las Vegas, I watched a man literally bow down to Trump when he was on stage. At that same speech, Lisa Mains, a Dutch immigrant who came to the United States in 1966, said to me, \u201cThe reason I\u2019m here? Support the only hope for America. As far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s God\u2019s gift to this country right now.\u201d I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the difficulty of covering Trump as one of the few minority reporters on the road full time covering him. Oftentimes, I found myself as one of the only people of color in the sea of thousands at Trump rallies. One time, at a speech in Reno, I was asked if I was a member of ISIS. This came weeks after another Trump supporter interrupted an interview to tell me to go back to Iraq where I came from. While I was discussing whether to get security or not, I was heartened when another Trump supporter, appalled by what he had just witnessed, had already went to find a security guard.  However, I was then subsequently disheartened when I told a Trump staffer what happened, and the staffer said that my situation was analogous to Trump being called a Nazi by the press. It wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 No matter what the future brings, covering Trump from the start to finish of his campaign will be unlike any other experience I will ever have. His supporters showed similar dedication to their candidate that long-suffering Cubs fans have for decades before their team finally won. I once asked 52-year-old Kurt Schnable, from Marengo, Illinois, if Trump could ever lose his support. Schnable drove more than 200 miles to Burlington, Iowa to hear Trump speak. \u201cThat would be very difficult,\u201d Schnable said. \u201cBought the cap last week.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Reince Priebus, the outgoing Republican National Committee chair, defended Donald Trump Sunday over the president-elect\u2019s charge last week, presented without proof, that \u201cmillions\u201d of people had voted illegally during the general election.  \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host John Dickerson pressed Priebus on that specific illegal vote claim, asking the incoming White House chief of staff how he handles the president-elect\u2019s statement \u201cwhen you know that that\u2019s not true.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s not true, John,\u201d Priebus said, saying that \u201cthere are estimates all over the map\u201d on undocumented immigrants voting in election.  \u201cBut you think millions of people voted illegally?\u201d Dickerson asked.  Priebus\u2019 response: \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d When the \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host pushed back, saying \u201cthere is not evidence that it happened in millions of votes in California,\u201d Priebus defended the president-elect once more.  \u201cI think the president-elect is someone who has pushed the envelope and caused people to think in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not taking conventional thought -- on every single issue and has caused people to look at things that maybe they have taken for granted.\u201d  Priebus then pointed to another issue Mr. Trump brought up last week: whether people burning the American flag should suffer consequences.  \u201cYou watch the news media and they say, well it\u2019s constitutional,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWell, right. It is constitutional, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a subject for debate and discussion for the Supreme Court to revisit down the road.\u201d Priebus also weighed in on the increasingly public feud over one contender for the secretary of state position: Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts governor and a one-time Republican presidential nominee.  \u201cI think that Governor Romney is very talented,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what really we should look at is that we\u2019ve got a president here in Donald Trump that wants to look at the best and brightest of America regardless regardless of background, regardless of past disputes that we may have had with each other... that is the past.\u201d Over the weekend, Mr. Trump drew criticism over a phone call he had with Taiwanese leader Tsai Ying-wen, breaking with U.S. foreign policy protocol and becoming the first president or president-elect to officially speak with Taiwan\u2019s president since 1979.  Priebus said Trump \u201cknew exactly what was happening\u201d and that the call was a brief, two-minute \u201ccongratulatory call.\u201d  \u201cLook, we\u2019ve got a lot of problems to solve in this country and we\u2019re not going to solve them by just, you know, making believe that people don\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cHe talked to [Chinese] President Xi over two weeks ago, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be willing to talk to him again. This is not a massive deviation of our policy, but President(-elect) Trump has made it clear that he is going to work with China -- PRC -- to make sure that we have a better deal, that we have better trade agreements, and that we do a better job in protecting the American worker and he\u2019s going to continue to do it.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 In another break with precedent, Mr. Trump was also reportedly foregoing daily intelligence briefings, according to a Washington Post report last month. Priebus, however, said the briefings were \u201chappening quite frequently.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about every day,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cI think those are just going to ramp up as we get closer to January 20th.\u201d  When pressed specifically about how many times Mr. Trump has received them, the incoming chief of staff replied: \u201cHe\u2019s certainly informed, he\u2019s getting briefed. It feels like every day. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s every day, but it\u2019s a lot.\u201d Asked more generally about Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership style and whether the president-elect was influenced most by the last person he spoke with, Priebus pushed back on that notion.  \u201cI think that what he is is someone who likes to listen to different opinion[s],\u201d Priebus said, but that ultimately, \u201cin the end, once he formulates his opinion, once he decides this is where we\u2019re going to go, he pulls the trigger and he moves.\u201d \u00a0",

            "article_content": "On Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump set off a political firestorm when he claimed, in a series of tweets, that he lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton because \u201cmillions\u201d of people voted illegally in the 2016 election. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally Mr. Trump\u2019s argument -- which came in the wake of a three-state recount effort initiated by Green Party candidate Jill Stein -- has been debunked by fact-checkers across the internet, including Politifact (which rated his claims \u201cPants on Fire\u201d), the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker blog and Snopes. \u201cSimply put, there is no evidence that \u201cmillions of people\u201d voted illegally in the election,\u201d the Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler wrote. So where is Mr. Trump getting his information? Asked about this issue on the daily transition call, Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller cited two sources for Mr. Trump\u2019s claims: a 2014 Washington Post article about non-citizen voting, and a 2012 Pew Research Center study that said one in eight voter registrations in the U.S. are no longer valid. \u201cSo all of these are studies and examples of where there have been issues of both voter fraud and illegal immigrants voting,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if this much attention and oxygen is going to be given to complete frivolous, throw away fundraising scheme[s] by someone like Jill Stein, then there should be actual substantive looks at the overall examples of voter fraud, illegal immigrants voting in recent years.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time both the 2014 Post story and the 2012 Pew study have gotten a mention this election cycle: back before Election Day, when Mr. Trump was warning his rallies of widespread voter fraud, these were the two stories he cited. Both were criticized at the time as insufficient proof. The Washington Post study he refers to, published in an October 2014 article titled \u201cCould non-citizens decide the November election,\u201d was not actually conducted by the newspaper -- it was a guest post by two professors from Old Dominion University who had just written a scholarly article on the topic. The two professors, Jesse Richman and David Earnest, used figures from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) in 2008 and 2010 to suggest that non-citizen voting is more widespread than people think. According to their research, 14 percent of non-citizens said in the survey data that they were registered to vote. However, the Post article was roundly criticized -- and Richman\u2019s and Earnest\u2019s methodology appeared to be dubious enough that the Post affixed a note at the top the article saying another article claimed the study\u2019s findings \u201cwere biased and that the authors\u2019 data do not provide evidence of non-citizen voting.\u201d The story was also published more than two years ago, and thus, it makes no claims about specific instances of non-citizen voting in 2016. As for the second source Miller cited, the 2012 Pew study, the study found that approximately 24 million voter registrations, or roughly one in eight, are either inaccurate no longer valid. Additionally, the study said 1.8 dead people are still listed as voters, and 2.75 million people are registered in more than one state. One of the authors of the Pew study, David Becker, tweeted Monday that Mr. Trump and his team were misrepresenting the findings of the study, though: while it did prove that the voter rolls contain names they shouldn\u2019t, their study included no concrete findings or conclusions about voter fraud.\u201d \u201cAs primary author of the report the Trump camp cited today, I can confirm that report made no findings re: voter fraud,\u201d Becker tweeted. There is a claim that three million undocumented immigrants voted illegally in 2016. This appears to have been originally published on InfoWars.com, the website run by radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.  The three million figure seems to have originated with a Republican self-described voter fraud expert, Gregg Phillips, whose Twitter bio says he works for an organization called VoteFraud.org. However, VoteFraud.org redirects to a website at the URL electionnightgatekeepers.com, which contains no evidence relating to non-citizen voting. Shen journalists began asking Phillips for his data, he said it was still being analyzed -- and he declined to make any information or evidence available. \u201cNo. We will release it in open form to the American people,\u201d he responded on Twitter to one reporter. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow the media to spin this first. Sorry.\u201d For their part, government and election officials have all denied that there is any issue with widespread non-citizen voting.  In another tweet Sunday, Mr. Trump suggested voter fraud had occurred in three states that he lost: California, New Hampshire and Virginia: Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! Officials in all three states disputed Mr. Trump\u2019s claims, saying there was no evidence whatsoever of widespread voter fraud. In California, Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation are \u201cabsurd.\u201d \u201cIt appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him,\u201d Padilla said in a statement Sunday night. \u201cHis unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect.\u201d In New Hampshire, Senior Deputy Secretary of State David M. Scanlan, who runs the state\u2019s Election Division, said their office had received a small number of complaints but nothing beyond the usual number they get in an election cycle. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication of anything that widespread taking place in New Hampshire,\u201d he said, according to the New Hampshire Union Leader. \u201cIf he has evidence he should pass it along so we can act on it.\u201d And in Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe said there was no reported voter fraud in the state and that Mr. Trump should \u201cput proof behind\u201d his allegations. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, too, said in Monday\u2019s press briefing that there has been \u201cno evidence produced to substantiate\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s claim. \u201cI think there is a difference between unfounded claims of fraud and a conscientious interpretation of the recount law that is consistent with the rules that Democrats and Republicans alike apply in a situation where there\u2019s a narrow victory by one candidate or the other,\u201d he said.

Amid growing fears about broad victories for far-right populism across Europe, Van der Bellen\u2019s victory will be seen as a sign of hope that similar movements can be defeated at the ballot box in other European countries next year.  Early results released Sunday evening in Austria, just after the polls had closed, found Van der Bellen with a 7-point lead over Hofer \u2013 far higher than any pre-election polls had suggested.  Hofer conceded the race shortly after the first results were released, thanking supporters in a Facebook post and calling for unity.  \u201cI congratulate Alexander Van der Bellen on his success and ask all Austrians to stay together and work together,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are all Austrians, no matter who the voters have chosen.\u201d Had Austria chosen Hofer on Sunday, the country would have elected the first far-right head of state in Europe since World War II. Hofer, who campaigned on an \u201cAustria first\u201d platform, is staunchly anti-refugee and has suggested Austria could hold a referendum on European Union membership.  At a time when voters distrust the political establishment and made it clear they were looking for a fresh face, Van der Bellen argued for making changes within the existing system, rather than trying to \u201cdestroy things\u201d outright. Unlike Hofer, he believes Austria should remain in the EU and has spoken about its importance. \u201cWe know that things need to change \u2013 but let\u2019s not destroy things,\u201d he said at his final rally on Friday. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to demolish the house because a couple of windows have become loose.\u201d  Van der Bellen\u2019s election is still historic in its own right, and reflects Austrian voters\u2019 anti-establishment sentiment in a different way: this is the first time in more than 50 years that Austria\u2019s president did not come from the two major parties, the center-left Social Democrats or the center-right Austrian People\u2019s Party.  Sunday\u2019s election brings to a close an unusually long election campaign in Austria, and confirms election results from earlier this year: Van der Bellen initially won a May election against Hofer by about 31,000 votes, but the country\u2019s constitutional court annulled the results after suggestions of voting irregularities. The court called for a re-vote which was ultimately not held until this weekend in early December, more than six months later. In order to overcome his critics, Hofer had repeatedly attempted to assure voters he was not as extreme as had been suggested.  \u201cI am just a normal guy,\u201d he told reporters after his final rally in Vienna Friday. \u201cI am not far-right.\u201d \u00a0 Van der Bellen, however, had framed the election as Europe\u2019s first line of defense against the far-right. He called Mr. Trump\u2019s election in the U.S. a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Austria and for Europe more broadly, calling on voters across the continent to look for common ground and band together. \u201cI don\u2019t want Austria to become the first western European nation where right-wing demagogues take power,\u201d he said at a November news conference. Defeating Hofer in Austria is only the first step in many for those who wish to keep the far-right out of power in Europe: several high-profile elections in 2017 will give similar forces an opportunity to increase their influence at the ballot box.  In March, the Netherlands votes in parliamentary elections, where Dutch Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders has a chance at becoming the next prime minister. France votes for its next president in April and May, with the National Front\u2019s Marine Le Pen poised to make it to the final round against Republican candidate Francois Fillon.  And in Germany, which votes next fall, Chancellor Angela Merkel is running for a fourth term but faces strong backlash over her policy on admitting refugees to Germany \u2013 an issue the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) has capitalized on in an effort to win seats in the German parliament.

            "article_content": "VIENNA -- Norbert Hofer of Austria\u2019s right-wing Freedom Party, narrowly lost the country\u2019s presidential election last May to Alexander Van der Bellen, a more mainstream, pro-Europe candidate. But a court nullified the results after reports of irregularities, and a new election has been set for Sunday. Founded by a former Nazi officer, the Freedom Party campaigned hard on an anti-immigrant platform. That hasn\u2019t changed, but what has is the U.S. election. \u201cThe Trump factor is here,\u201d said political commentator Thomas Hofer. He said Donald Trump\u2019s win has emboldened Austria\u2019s right wing. \u201cYou see huge parallels; the wall on the southern border is well and alive here in Austria as an issue, anti-immigrant message, anti-establishment message,\u201d he said. There are overlapping tactics too, including fake news. False stories have spread online that claim Van der Bellen has cancer. \u201cIt\u2019s about undermining, not only undermining the message of the other side, but also spreading news, fake news,\u201d Thomas Hofer said. In May, CBS News correspondent Seth Doane went on the campaign trail with Freedom Party boss Wolfgang Jung, and got a taste of his anti-Auslim rhetoric. \u201cI don\u2019t want a mosque here,\u201d Jung said at the time. Now, Jung is saying that momentum is on their side. \u201cAfter Trump\u2019s surprise win your candidate said, \u2018Hey, we can do this too,\u2019\u201d Doane said. \u201cYes, and I hope so!\u201d Jung replied. This election is not just about Austria. The far right in France is watching, as is Germany, the country that has taken in the most refugees. Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing a growing threat from an ultra-nationalist, anti-immigrant party.",

            "article_content": "VIENNA\u00a0-- In the wake of the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the United States, far-right parties across Europe are eyeing other countries on the map where their newly energized movement could win at the ballot box. Austria, which holds its presidential election Sunday, is among the first to test the staying power of right-wing populism in Europe: if polls here are right, the country is poised to elect Europe\u2019s first far-right head of state since World War II.\u00a0 The results could have far-reaching implications for politics beyond Austria\u2019s borders \u2013 and signal further far-right victories in a half-dozen countries with elections slated for 2017. Norbert Hofer, the 45-year-old candidate for the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, holds a narrow but consistent lead in the polls over Green Party candidate Alexander Van der Bellen heading into the final stretch. Hofer has much in common with other far-right leaders across Europe, like Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands: Campaigning on a platform of \u201cputting Austria first,\u201d he is staunchly anti-refugee, has said he favors a referendum vote on European Union membership and claimed Islam \u201chas no place in Austria.\u201d Still, for his part, Hofer has repeatedly rejected the label of \u201cfar-right,\u201d working to assure voters and journalists alike that he is not what his opponents make him out to be. Asked by a journalist after his final rally in Vienna whether Europe should \u201cfear\u201d him as president, Hofer said no. \u201cI am just a normal guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not far-right.\u201d Van der Bellen, meanwhile, said Mr. Trump\u2019s election in the U.S. is a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Austria and its European neighbors, calling for European countries to band together \u2013 and suggesting Austria could help trigger far-right victories elsewhere if voters don\u2019t reject Hofer. \u201cI don\u2019t want Austria to become the first western European nation where right-wing demagogues take power,\u201d Van der Bellen said at a November news conference. Sunday\u2019s election follows more than six months of uncertainty over who would next lead Austria: Hofer and Van der Bellen initially faced off last May in a second-round vote that was supposed to determine the next president.\u00a0 Van der Bellen won that contest narrowly, by just 31,000 votes -- however, Austria\u2019s constitutional court annulled the results after evidence of voting irregularities and called for a revote. The new election was then scheduled for early October, but an issue with the glue on Austria\u2019s ballots forced Austrian officials to push the election date back to December. As Europe heads into 2017, Austria is just the beginning when it comes to the potential for far-right political gains at the ballot box. In March, the Netherlands votes in parliamentary elections, where Dutch Freedom Party leader Wilders has a chance at becoming the next prime minister. Then France votes for its next president in April and May, with the National Front\u2019s Le Pen poised to make it to the final round against Republican candidate Francois Fillon.\u00a0 And in neighboring Germany, which votes next fall, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing strong backlash to her policy on admitting refugees to Germany. The far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) has worked to capitalize on anti-refugee sentiment in the country, and its victories in several state elections over the course of 2016 means the party is likely to win seats in the German parliament. Both candidates held final rallies in Vienna on Friday, making their final pitch to voters. Hofer, who spoke at Vienna\u2019s old stock exchange Friday morning, framed the election as an opportunity to revitalize Austria. His message has been compared to that of Mr. Trump, who promised to \u201cMake America Great Again;\u201d Hofer wants Austrians to be \u201cproud again.\u201d \u201cAustrian men and Austrian women have a strong will to succeed \u2013 to make this country a success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old dust has to be shaken off and we will be proud again to be Austrian.\u201d And Van der Bellen urged voters to work within the existing system to change things, rather than give in to a desire to \u201cdestroy things.\u201d \u201cWe know that things need to change \u2013 but let\u2019s not destroy things,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026You don\u2019t need to demolish the house because a couple of windows have become loose.\u201d\u00a0 In Vienna on Saturday, just one day before Election Day here, things were mostly quiet on the political front: Van der Bellen volunteers handed out flyers and bags of Van der Bellen-branded fruit snacks Saturday evening in front of the city\u2019s famous Christmas market at the Rathaus (city hall). Earlier in the day, an anti-Hofer group staged a small march through part of the city, chanting, \u201cAnti-fascist!\u201d and \u201cDown with the Freedom Party!\u201d\u00a0 Many of the protesters in the march \u2013 which were not affiliated with Van der Bellen\u2019s campaign \u2013 held signs that read, \u201cNo Nazis in the Hofburg,\u201d referring to the residence of the president. One protester held up a Hillary Clinton campaign sign saying, \u201cLove trumps hate,\u201d one of the campaign\u2019s most-used phrases this year. Michael Sumasgutner, a 21-year-old who recently switched his support to Van der Bellen after voting previously for Hofer, said membership in the EU is one of the most important issues to him \u2013 and that Hofer\u2019s position on the issue was a big part of the reason he changed his mind. \u201cI think it\u2019s important Austria stays in the EU because it\u2019s a good connection,\u201d he said. Still, he said, he understands the underlying frustration with the status quo that has drawn many Austrians -- including young voters -- to Hofer and his message of change and prosperity. \u201cThere are many problems in this country: like there are no jobs, the economy is not growing, issues of culture,\u201d he said. He added that many voters feel that \u201cthe other parties are not working on the issues enough -- people are more attracted by the Freedom Party and want someone else in charge.\u201d Indeed, Sunday\u2019s result will be historic on that front: it will be the first time in more than half a decade that the presidency is not held by a member of the center-right party (the Austrian People\u2019s Party) or the center-left party (the Social Democrats). Hofer\u2019s supporters praised him as a defender of Austria and its national identity, saying he will bring the needed change to the country. \u201cI think he\u2019s the better president for us \u2013 he\u2019s for Austrians,\u201d said Manfred Dvorak, 54, of Vienna. He added that using the \u201cNazi\u201d label for Hofer, as the candidate\u2019s opponents have done, is \u201cstupid.\u201d \u201cWhen people run out of arguments, then there\u2019s always this Nazi [accusation],\u201d he said. David Heuser, 25, marched Saturday with the anti-Hofer crowd -- but said he ultimately believes Hofer will win the election. \u201cI fear that [Van der Bellen] will lose tomorrow \u2026 and that the right wing candidate will win,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he does, we will protest against him.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "ATHENS, Greece President Obama brought a message of reassurance to Greece -- even so, the questions that faced him at a news conference in Athens with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras were dominated by the recent election of Donald Trump. In response to a question about whether he realized there was anger in the American populace before the election, the president said, \u201cOf course I did.\u201d But he acknowledged that the candidacies of both Democrat Bernie Sanders and of Donald Trump were able to tap into the anger and fear of many Americans. \u201cWhen you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders -- very unconventional candidates -- have considerable success, then obviously there\u2019s something there that\u2019s being tapped into,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cA suspicion of globalization. A desire to rein in its excesses. A suspicion of elites and governing institutions that people feel may not be responsive to their immediate needs. And that sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity. And that can be a volatile mix.\u201d President Obama said that world leaders need to pay heed to people\u2019s very real fears of economic dislocation and inequality in the midst of globalization. \u201cThe more aggressively and effectively we deal with those issues, the less those fears may channel themselves into counterproductive approaches that can pit people against each other,\u201d Obama said as he opened the last foreign tour of his presidency. The president said that both Trump\u2019s election and the British vote to leave the European Union reflected the need to deal with \u201cpeople\u2019s fears that their children won\u2019t do as well as they have.\u201d \u201cSometimes people just feel as if we want to try something and see if we can shake things up,\u201d Obama said. And he said that in times of stress, people are going to be looking for something. \u201cThey might \u00a0not know what they\u2019re looking for,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cand they may opt for change, even if they\u2019re not entirely confident what that change will bring.\u201d The president seemed skeptical that \u201cthe new prescriptions being offered\u201d would satisfy the frustrations and anger evident in both votes. And he played a bit of defense, saying that his agenda over past eight years had dealt with those issues head on and \u201cthe country\u2019s indisputably better off.\u201d The president earlier opened his Greek visit by offering reassuring words in Greece about the U.S. commitment to NATO even as he prepares to hand off to a Donald Trump administration, saying Democratic and Republican administrations alike recognize the importance of the alliance to the trans-Atlantic relationship. Mr. Obama told Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos that a strong NATO is of \u201cutmost importance\u201d and would provide \u201csignificant continuity even as we see a transition in government in the United States.\u201d Pavlopoulos, for his part, thanked President Obama for U.S. support of the Greek people in a time of social and economic crisis, and said he was confident that Trump \u201cwill continue on the same path.\u201d Trump\u2019s election has generated significant unease in Europe because of his tough talk during the campaign suggesting the U.S. might pull out of the NATO alliance if other countries don\u2019t pay more. Mr. Obama\u2019s reassurances reflect an attempt to ease the deep concerns about Trump and the future of America\u2019s treaty alliances. Yet they may be greeted with skepticism: For months throughout the campaign, President Obama repeatedly assured world leaders in public and private that Trump would not be elected, only to see him emerge victorious from last week\u2019s election. The president also met Tuesday with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, and offered a welcome message of support for the Greeks as they struggle with both economic woes and a huge influx of refugees. The presidetnpledged to keep pressing his view that \u201causterity alone cannot deliver prosperity and that it is going to be important both with respect to debt relief and other accommodative strategies to help the Greek people in this period of adjustment.\u201d Mr. Obama is making the first visit to Greece by a sitting U.S. president since Bill Clinton in 1999. Security was tight, with major roads shut down along President Obama\u2019s motorcade route and a ban on public gatherings and demonstrations in swaths of central Athens and a southern suburb near a seaside luxury hotel where he was staying. Boats were also banned from sailing near the coastline at the hotel\u2019s location. More than 5,000 police were deployed in the capital\u2019s streets for the two-day visit. Left-wing and anarchist groups have planned protest demonstrations for Tuesday afternoon, while an armed anarchist group has called for \u201cattacks and clashes\u201d to disrupt Mr. Obama\u2019s visit. Clinton\u2019s visit, which came during the height of U.S. intervention in the wars ensuing from the breakup of Yugoslavia, was marked with extensive violent demonstrations. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to tour the Acropolis and give a major speech about democracy and globalization before flying on to Berlin. From Germany, he will travel to Peru for an Asian economic summit before returning to Washington on Saturday. President Obama said he was looking forward to visiting the Acropolis because \u201cif you come to Greece you\u2019ve got to do a little bit of sightseeing.\u201d Greece\u2019s government has hailed the president\u2019s visit as being of \u201chuge importance\u201d for both Greece and Europe. The country\u2019s left-led coalition government has been struggling to pull Greece out of six years of a vicious financial crisis that has devastated its economy and left more than a quarter of the workforce unemployed. Despite the U.S. election, the government has pinned its hopes on the U.S. president to help persuade some of the country\u2019s more reluctant international creditors, such as Germany, to grant it significant debt relief. Without a cut in its debt, Athens says, it cannot hope to recover economically - an argument also supported by the International Monetary Fund. Greece has been relying on emergency loans from three consecutive multi-billion euro bailouts from other European Union countries using the euro currency, and the IMF, since 2010. While the United States has not been involved in Greece\u2019s bailout, Athens has long seen it as an ally that could apply pressure on creditors. The U.S. has praised Greek efforts to overhaul its economy but has repeatedly stressed the country must continue with painful reforms. The country\u2019s bailout funds are disbursed following reviews by international debt inspectors of mandated reforms. The government will also be looking for recognition of the country\u2019s role in Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, which saw hundreds of thousands of refugees pass through Greece from Turkey on their way to the more prosperous countries of the European north, and for U.S. pressure on the rest of Europe to help shoulder the burden.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump declared during his presidential campaign that he would pursue an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy approach in the White House, but the reality is that few of the problems he\u2019ll inherit lend themselves to simple solutions. The terror threat is among them -- over the course of a single day last week, there were attacks in Ankara, Berlin and Zurich, with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claiming responsibility for the truck rampage in Germany.  Mr. Trump has already waded into foreign policy debates during his transition and while he has hinted at his foreign policy approach for certain regions, experts say he hasn\u2019t shown a clear-cut strategy for others. Here are some of the top foreign policy challenges he\u2019ll face next year: Mr. Trump will enter the White House next month nearly six years after the Syrian civil war erupted and while he has criticized the Obama administration\u2019s somewhat hands-off posture there, one expert says it will likely be adopted by the new administration.  \u201cI think that the risk aversion on militarizing the U.S. role on Syria that the Obama administration displayed will continue under the Trump administration,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, vice president for new initiatives at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who has helped advise Democratic and Republican secretaries of state on Middle East policy. \u201cI suspect, based on everything he said on \u2018America First,\u2019 he\u2019s going to be very reluctant to get involved in the weeds in reconstructing Syria.\u201d In November, Mr. Trump indicated that he would likely cut off U.S. support for moderate Syrian rebel groups once he takes office and focus instead on targeting ISIS. He\u2019ll also have to decide what posture to adopt toward President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime and Russia, which has helped fight opposition forces, and he\u2019ll have to decide how to deal with Raqqa once it\u2019s liberated from ISIS control. Syria\u2019s humanitarian crisis is part of the conundrum. More than 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and more than 6 million are internally displaced by violence, the United Nations says, and thousands of civilians have been evacuated from Aleppo in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump said his administration is going to help build \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria.  Despite the announcement, he made clear on the campaign trail that his administration would block people from entering the U.S. from places with a history of terror ties. He has also blasted the Obama administration for admitting more than 10,000 Syrian refugees into the U.S. over the last year. The president-elect will have to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose relations with the West have deteriorated since his government\u2019s illegal seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its support of armed separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Mr. Trump has signaled he\u2019d like to follow through on his promise to improve relations with Russia by nominating ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has close ties with Russia, as his secretary of state.  He also recently called the the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia tried to help his candidacy \u201cridiculous.\u201d While he\u2019s demonstrating he wants to achieve a better relationship with Russia, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Defense Secretary nominee Gen. James Mattis (ret.), as well as congressional mainstream Republicans could mitigate any action taken in that direction. \u201cI worry, if he goes with his instincts. I will be more comfortable if he heeds the advice that he\u2019s likely to get from the vice president-elect and the secretary of defense and maybe the secretary of state,\u201d said Steven Pifer, senior fellow the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center on the United States and Europe. Mr. Trump and his advisers, however, have raised the possibility of removing sanctions the U.S. has imposed on Russia for two years, and he\u2019ll have to decide whether to renew them in March.  \u201cIf President Trump comes in and lifts the American sanctions that are on Russia, my guess is it\u2019s going to be very hard for [German] Chancellor [Angela] Merkel and others in the European Union to hold the line in Europe,\u201d Pifer said. \u201cThe West would have given up a huge piece of leverage it has over Russia to try to persuade Russia to try to change its policy toward eastern Ukraine in particular, but also toward Crimea.\u201d The Trump administration also might not see eye-to-eye with Russia on issues like undoing the Iranian nuclear deal, as Mr. Trump has proposed. Russia helped negotiate the agreement and wouldn\u2019t be likely to support pulling out.  Mr. Trump will face a number of challenges with China: friction over trade and economic issues, the cybersecurity threat, its militarization of the South China sea, its pressure on Taiwan and its unwillingness to put pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.  He raised eyebrows when he took a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan after the election and he later said that the U.S. is not bound by the One-China policy -- a diplomatic understanding that has defined the relationship between Washington and Beijing for more than 40 years. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we have to be bound by a One-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI mean, look, we\u2019re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation, with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don\u2019t tax them, with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn\u2019t be doing, and frankly with not helping us at all with North Korea.\u201d The president-elect has also vowed he\u2019d declare China a currency manipulator as soon as he takes office, a promise that is on his campaign website. Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, said the Trump team doesn\u2019t seem to have a full strategy yet on China.  \u201cIt looks to me like Trump is trying to keep China off balance, to try and signal that he\u2019s not necessarily going to conduct business as usual in the same way that it has been conducted over the last eight years under Obama and that he thinks it can appears that he can gain some leverage by signaling a willingness to confront China,\u201d she said.  For the last several months, North Korea has been firing off multiple ballistic missiles and analysts believe that President Obama warned Mr. Trump about the serious threat posed by North Korea during their private 90-minute meeting at the White House following the election.  Glaser said the president-elect, however, seems to lack a plan on North Korea since it\u2019s \u201cnot an issue that Trump knows a lot about.\u201d The concern for the U.S., she said, is that the North Koreans could pose an existential threat to the homeland if they can make a nuclear warhead that can potentially reach U.S. territory.  \u201cDo we have a strategy that focuses on defense? Do we take a much more aggressive posture against North Korea?\u201d Glaser wondered about Trump\u2019s plan. \u201cSome people are raising the possibility of a preemptive strike on a missile, if it\u2019s on a launchpad, because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s atop that missile, whether it\u2019s a satellite or a nuclear warhead. There may be some discussions about whether we really need to try to cut off trade and harm North Korea\u2019s economy, go beyond sanctions that are really focused on depriving North Korea of weapons of mass destruction.\u201d Mr. Trump faces an evolving Europe whose postwar framework could be threatened by Russia and a wave of far-right leaders. This comes as the United Kingdom deals with the process of withdrawing from the European Union after the Brexit vote this year.  \u201cEuropeans will be looking for American leadership and engagement,\u201d said James Cunningham, a former U.S. ambassador who has worked for NATO and the U.S. embassy in Rome. The president-elect\u2019s approach toward Europe, Pifer added, will be shaped by his approach toward Russia. Mr. Trump will have to decide, for example, whether NATO should beef up its presence in the Baltic states and Poland to defend them against Russia. But if Trump shifts current U.S. policy on Russia to improve relations, it could create rifts within the European Union, which Pifer predicts would create problems.  \u201cI\u2019m worried. I can see an outcome that if he listens to the Republican mainstream foreign policy, you\u2019ll see some changes but it won\u2019t be dramatic,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the things he suggested on the campaign trail -- reluctance to criticize Putin, the constant theme that we can have a better relationship with Russia --  I worry that we could be making a fairly major departure that in the end would end up endangering American interests.\u201d The president-elect has said he wants to help broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal and potentially make his son-in-law Jared Kushner the negotiator, but experts say the prospects of an agreement are slim to none.  \u201cIt has nothing to do with who the mediator is,\u201d said the Wilson Center\u2019s Miller, \u201cand has a lot to do with the simple reality that Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas are simply not prepared to take the kinds of decisions on the six core issues that drive the conflict -- borders, security, refugees, Jerusalem, recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, end of claims in conflict. Neither side is prepared to take the kind of decisions that would allow a mediator to get close.\u201d  What could permanently undermine the peace process, Miller said, is a transfer by the Trump administration of the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

            "article_content": "DALLAS -- The exclusive Dallas boys\u2019 prep school that Richard B. Spencer attended is denouncing the activities and ideas of its white nationalist alumnus.  St. Mark\u2019s School of Texas headmaster David Dini issued the statement of criticism after a Nov. 19 rally in Washington where Spencer, a member of St. Marks Class of 1997, shouted \u201cHail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\u201d as supporters raised their arms in Nazi salutes.  Without referring to Spencer by name, Dini said his activities have \u201cbeen deeply troubling and terribly upsetting to our whole school community. We reject racism and bigotry in all its forms and expressions.\u201d In his statement, posted on the school\u2019s Facebook page, Dini hailed other St. Mark\u2019s alumni for \u201cexpressing their outrage and disgust\u201d toward the National Policy Institute, which Spencer heads, and the ideas that group promotes.  Spencer\u2019s classmates have raised about $40,000 so far in a fundraising campaign to settle refugees in Dallas. One of them is Ben Kusin, former \u201cShark Tank\u201d contestant and chief executive of deodorizing wipes company.  \u201cThis issue hits deep -- not just for me but for everyone,\u201d he told WFAA-TV of Dallas-Fort Worth, adding about the rally, \u201cWhen you see something like this, you have to say something.\u201d\u00a0 The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group watchdog, describes Spencer as \u201cone of the country\u2019s most successful young white nationalist leaders -- a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old.\u201d  \u201cHe wants to expel all these non-white Europeans from this country,\u201d Kusin said. \u201cOur countermeasure was supporting refugees coming into this country.\u201d\u00a0 Spencer spoke with CBS News\u2019 Jericka Duncan last week about how Donald Trump\u2019s election was giving the alt-right a big boost. \u201cThe word racist doesn\u2019t have any meaning anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically calling me a mean old guy.\u201d\u00a0 Does he discriminate against people because of the color of their skin? Duncan asked him.\u00a0 \u201cEveryone is discriminating in all sorts of things in terms of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI discriminate all the time \u2013 discriminating is living.\u201d\u00a0 An email message to Spencer from The Associated Press drew no response Sunday.  Other school alumni include folklorist/musicologist Alan Lomax, rock stars Steve Miller and Boz Scaggs, actors Tommy Lee Jones and Luke and Owen Wilson, and investigative journalist Kurt Eichenwald.",

            "article_content": "LEESBURG, V.A. -- A hoarse Donald Trump took the stage after midnight -- almost three hours late -- at a fairground here in Leesburg, Virginia. It was his fifth event Sunday.  Thousands of supporters packed the barn and it didn\u2019t seem like anyone was frustrated by Trump\u2019s tardiness, or as he called it, \u201ca midnight special.\u201d  It was the busiest day in Trump\u2019s quixotic year and a half run for the presidency, two days before Election Day. Trump started his run on June 16, 2015. \u201cFamous day, right?\u201d Trump said at his first rally of the day in Sioux City, Iowa.  The stops Trump made; Sioux City, Iowa, an airport hangar in Minneapolis, Minnesota, an amphitheater in suburban Detroit, another airport hangar outside Pittsburgh, and the barn in Northern Virginia, indicated a candidate desperately trying to cobble together a narrow path to 270 electoral votes, as early voting shows other paths out of reach.  \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing,\u201d Trump said in Minneapolis. \u201cIf I don\u2019t win Minnesota, I\u2019m gonna look real bad to those pundits that I do not respect very much.\u201d  The last time Minnesota\u2019s electoral votes went to a Republican presidential candidate was Richard Nixon in 1972. Recent polling shows Hillary Clinton with a comfortable lead in the state. However,\u00a0 Trump needs an upset from a traditionally Democratic states to have any hope of winning the White House -- especially as early voting in battleground states such as Nevada show a significant increase in Hispanic turnout, a demographic which has long viewed Trump unfavorably. Trump is the underdog in most of the other states he campaigned in on Sunday. Polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia have also given Clinton a comfortable lead, although Democrats have shown enough concern that Trump is closing the gap to send a bevy of surrogates there, including sending the former Secretary of State herself to speak in Detroit on Friday.  The Republican nominee\u2019s messaging was knocked off kilter on Sunday when news of FBI director James Comey\u2019s letter to Congress broke, stating that new emails discovered on disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop, related to Clinton\u2019s private email server from her time as Secretary of State, did not contain anything that would change the FBI\u2019s conclusion from the summer -- that this did not rise to the level of criminal prosecution.  After days of praising Comey and the FBI for re-opening the investigation into Clinton, Trump tweaked his message to subtly criticize Comey, saying, \u201cThe investigations into her crimes will go on for a long, long time.\u00a0 The rank and file special agents at the FBI won\u2019t let her get away with her terrible crimes.\u201d  \u201cYou can\u2019t review 650,000 new emails in eight days,\u201d He continued.\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t do it, folks.\u201d  Trump\u2019s ability to stay on message was sorely tested, as he frequently deviated off his prepared remarks, extending his speeches and dragging his schedule later and later into in the night. In particular, Trump seemed fixated on Beyonce and Jay-Z, who recently performed on behalf of Clinton at a campaign event in Cleveland, Ohio.  \u201cJay-Z and Beyonce used the most filthy language you\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Trump said in Minneapolis, referring to their performances on behalf of Clinton. \u201cMany of the audience left during the audience because it was disgusting, the words, right? They left.\u201d  Ironically, Trump\u2019s warm up at his next event in the Detroit suburb of Sterling Heights was musician Ted Nugent,\u00a0 who has long faced criticism for racist and anti-Semitic comments.  Nugent, whose hits include \u201cCat Scratch Fever,\u201d lived up to his raunchy reputation on Sunday. During his remarks, Nugent grabbed his private parts and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got your blue state right here, baby!\u201d  Trump came on stage after and said, \u201cBy the way, my language is much, much cleaner as you know than Jay-Z and Beyonce, boy.\u201d  Trump circled back again to discussing his ambitions to engage in a fist fight with Vice President Joe Biden, a subject he has kept circling back to for weeks.  \u201cBiden, who said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019d like to take him behind the gym.\u2019 Me. I dream about that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd everybody said, \u2018Oh, wasn\u2019t that nice? Oh, did you see what he said? Wasn\u2019t that cute? Oh, it was so wonderful what Joe said. What Joe said. Wasn\u2019t that cute?\u2019 Now, if I ever said that I wanna take him behind the gym and you know what. They\u2019d say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a bully. He\u2019s a terrible person.\u2019\u201d  His darkest rhetoric of the whirlwind day was aimed at the large Somali community in Minnesota, numbering in the tens of thousands.  \u201cHow stupid are they to allow this to happen?\u201d Trump said. \u201dHere in Minnesota, you\u2019ve seen first-hand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without\u00a0 your support or approval, and with some of them then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world.\u201d  Trump continued.  \u201cA Trump Administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they are being placed.\u201d  The crowd at the airport hangar in Minneapolis erupted in cheers.  \u201cIt\u2019s the least they can do for you. You\u2019ve suffered enough in Minnesota.\u201d  Trump\u2019s last day of campaigning before Election Day is equally as hectic, with stops in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan on the schedule. Confidence in his ability \u201cto win,\u201d of course, has never been lacking in the businessman.  \u201cWe have the biggest crowds and it\u2019s the greatest movement ever in the history of our country, Trump said in Michigan. \u201cWe now have to go out and we have to vote.\u201d  In Virginia, he added , \u201dThis is going to be Brexit times fifty. This is going to be.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Obama on Thursday warned Donald Trump that he should be willing to stand up to Russia as president, and he talked about his expectations for the president-elect\u2019s actions concerning key U.S. policies and international commitments.  Speaking from Berlin at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during his final trip abroad as president, Mr. Obama said that while he doesn\u2019t expect Trump to follow his administration\u2019s blueprint, he expects him to act in U.S. interests.  \u201cMy hope is that the president-elect, coming in, takes a similarly constructive approach -- finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia, where our values and interests align -- but that the president-elect is also willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms,\u201d Mr. Obama said.  The president suggested it would be harmful if Trump takes a \u201crealpolitik approach\u201d where the U.S. cuts deals with Russia \u201ceven if it hurts people, or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves countries vulnerable.\u201d  Mr. Obama reiterated that he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201cinsistence\u201d he won\u2019t change the U.S. commitment to NATO, which the president said Trump made clear to him during a 90-minute meeting at the White House last week.  \u201cHis full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security is, I think, very important,\u201d Mr. Obama said.  Mr. Obama is on his last foreign trip, which also includes stops in Greece and Peru. While both leaders met privately, Mr. Obama said they discussed efforts to keep the U.S. and Germany economically competitive, negotiations resulting from Brexit -- the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, the threat of climate change and implementing the Paris agreement, ensuring Iran continues to abide by its nuclear deal, countering cyber threats and the importance of maintaining sanctions against Russia.  Responding to Trump\u2019s previous remarks about stopping the flow of Syrian refugees to the U.S., Mr. Obama said that the global refugee problem is not an issue any one country should bear, and said he hopes robust support for an international response \u201ccontinues beyond my administration.\u201d  The president warned that \u201cpolitics everywhere\u201d will now experience a \u201cbumpy phase.\u201d \u201cAs long as we stay true to our democratic principles, as long as elections have integrity, as along as we respect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, as long as there are checks and balances in our governments so that the people have the ability to not just make judgments about how well the government is serving them, but changing government if the government is not serving them well, then I have confidence that over the long-term, progress will continue,\u201d the president said during his sixth visit to Germany.  In what appeared to be a reflection of Democrats\u2019 failure to connect with every demographic in the presidential election, Mr. Obama said, \u201cIt\u2019s important that we reach out to everybody in our countries -- those who feel disaffected, those who feel left behind by globalization and address their concerns in constructive ways, as opposed to more destructive ways.\u201d  He talked about the danger of presenting stories that aren\u2019t true in the age of social media, as well as the problemsof using social networks in politics.  \u201cIt\u2019s easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communications complex policies,\u201d he said.  In the end, he said he\u2019s \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about his successor.  \u201cThere something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the U.S., not just by its own people, but by people around the world that forces you to focus, that demands seriousness,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf you\u2019re not serious about the job, then you probably won\u2019t be there very long because it will expose problems even when you\u2019re doing a good job.\u201d Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "SAN DIEGO -- Army Capt. Matthew Ball relied heavily on his Afghan interpreter during a yearlong mission in one of Afghanistan\u2019s most dangerous areas, entrusting him daily with his life.  The interpreter received death threats from the Taliban for helping American troops, and has now been in hiding for nearly four years. He ventures out only in the cloak of darkness.  \u201cI\u2019m living my days in hell. Even if someone is not really looking at me, I feel so paranoid, like this guy is going to kill me,\u201d Qismat Amin said in an interview with The Associated Press via an internet call.  Amin is one of more than 13,000 Afghans and their immediate family members waiting to get a special immigrant visa for aiding the U.S. mission, according to the U.S. State Department. A defense bill approved by Congress and sent to President Barack Obama calls for an additional 1,500 visas and extends the program until the end of 2020.  Scores of veterans like Ball, who have been trying to get their translators out of the country, say the number is woefully inadequate and that the United States will be abandoning thousands who helped American troops.  \u201cWe leave and they\u2019re still there and they get hunted, basically, for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Ball, 30, a former Army ranger who now serves in the Reserves. \u201cBeing an interpreter makes you a target. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t live up to our promises on the back end.\u201d\u00a0 America\u2019s longest war, which began in response to 9/11, grinds on in its 16th year. Afghan soldiers and police have been suffering heavy casualties in their battle against a resilient Taliban insurgency, while U.S. forces continue to hunt down al Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants there.  The special visa program started in 2009 to help Afghan translators, cultural advisers and others who have worked for U.S. military or government personnel.  Ball\u2019s interpreter applied more than three years ago for a visa. Among Amin\u2019s letters of recommendation was one from retired Army Gen. John Campbell, the former commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.  ISIS fighters have demanded Amin return to his village, and they took his family\u2019s land last year. But Amin knows he will be killed if he goes back so he has moved to a nearby city.  A bomb blew up outside a police headquarters near where he lives now. A man living nearby was shot by unidentified assailants. Neighbors said he was targeted after working for Americans.  Amin has been unable to work and has spent most of the earnings from working for the U.S. military, which paid him about $650 a month.  Ball has tried to find out why Amin\u2019s visa is in limbo. Now a Stanford University law student, Ball organized a letter drive that led to a dozen congressional inquiries into Amin\u2019s case, to no avail.  Amin this month was told to come in for a medical appointment at the U.S. embassy in Kabul, another step forward in the process. But he still has no word on whether he\u2019ll get a visa.  Amin\u2019s long wait is not unique.  Sher Mohammad Haidari, 26, submitted more than three dozen written recommendations from colonels, generals and other U.S. military officers who commended him for his bravery. In one incident, Haidari heard the Taliban speak in code about firing on two dozen soldiers and translated it to the troops. They took cover, and a three-hour firefight ensued. He was wounded.  In 2011, Haidari completed a three-hour interview for his visa. Then everything stalled. He regularly received death threats until his visa finally was approved this year. Haidari moved to California with his wife and baby son in September.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other interpreters who were shot, hurt, are crazy disabled, and all of them are stuck in Afghanistan,\u201d Haidari said.  David Sossaman, 57, a security specialist, lobbied for Haidari and three other interpreters who worked for him.  \u201cI can\u2019t figure out why there is even a cap at all,\u201d said Sossaman, who lives in Ramona, east of San Diego. \u201cIf somebody assisted us in the war over there and saved American lives by running convoys so our troops could be doing their jobs, or whatever, and they now have gotten active threats by known Taliban, why even limit it?\u201d  Congress has added 7,000 visas to the program over the past two years to meet the demand, and the process has sped up. So far in fiscal year 2016, a total of 4,283 visas have been issued to Afghans who helped the U.S. mission. That compares to 2,636 for 2015, the state department said in an October report.  But thousands are still waiting amid the worsening security situation.  Betsy Fisher, policy director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, wanted Congress to approve an additional 4,000 visas so the process could be expedited for applicants living in danger.  New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, agreed, saying: \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of life and death as Afghans who served the U.S. mission continue to be systematically hunted down by the Taliban.\u201d  The program has enjoyed bipartisan support. But veterans, like Ball, worry about its future under President-elect Donald Trump, whose national security campaign proposals included a temporary ban on Muslims, the religion of many of the Afghans who helped the U.S. mission. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, has objected to increasing the visas. He raised concerns about its costs tied to federal benefits like Medicaid and food stamps that are available to Afghans who resettle in the U.S. and become lawful permanent residents.  After Trump\u2019s election, Ball received a message from Amin, who said he was growing increasingly fearful for his life.  \u201cHe told me, \u2018If I stay too long, I might not make it,\u2019 which totally breaks my heart,\u201d Ball said.\u00a0",

She talked to CBS News about why her daughters don\u2019t watch \u201cFrozen,\u201d her holiday plans and how she feels about the president-elect.  Tell me what was fun about making these commercials for Enterprise.  It was very collaborative. They were interested in how I interpreted the script.

They like the characters but they don\u2019t really watch the movie. We do a lot of PBS Kids. Their attention span is not two hours as of yet, so we do the 11-minute TV show programs when they watch TV.  Do they understand that that\u2019s you as Anna, though?  They do because we talk about it with them -- what we do for a living -- and they know there\u2019s a real person behind the voices of the cartoons they watch and my daughter was watching a cartoon and said, \u201cThey\u2019re not real, but there is a person behind them doing a voice.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYeah, oh my gosh, you get this.\u201d She sounds really smart.  She knows Idina is Elsa. She knows Josh is Olaf. She\u2019s able to associate humans with characters, which I think is rare for a three-year-old.  What can you tell us about \u201cFrozen 2\u201d? I wish I knew. We haven\u2019t seen anything yet. I thought we\u2019d be recording by now but they\u2019re still working on the script. But we did an Olaf special that comes out next Christmas and the music has been written for it.  There\u2019s been a lot of talk about how \u201cFrozen\u201d really diverges from traditional princess stories and embraces strong women. How does it feel to be part of a project like that?  I feel proud. I don\u2019t love stories that have just a bad guy and you never explore what made them bad or sad and \u201cFrozen\u201d did a great job with that. We talk with the kids about why the bad guy is sad and what made him sad and grumpy. I was really proud \u201cFrozen\u201d didn\u2019t really have a villain, or at least not in Elsa. She was a very complex, misunderstood character. I was really proud of representing that story.  You represent lots of viewpoints on social media or in your art. You\u2019ve talked about mental health, the Syrian refugee crisis, equal pay -- what\u2019s been the best part of having the platform you have?  Just knowing I can be a voice for people who feel voiceless. There are important issues that many of us don\u2019t see on a day-to-day basis in the comfort of our lives and I am definitely included in that. I don\u2019t run into refugees here in L.A. but I stay abreast of what\u2019s happening because people are important to me.  You were pretty vocal against Donald Trump during election season. Now that he\u2019s our president-elect, how do you feel about moving forward?  I think it\u2019s important to unify our country again. I think the most important thing is to listen, to hear other people and hear where they\u2019re coming from. I think understanding people is the only thing that works.  Speaking of equal pay, was there a time in your career when you felt particularly discriminated against for being a woman?  In \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall,\u201dJason Segel was the only one nude in the movie. I thought it was about time someone turned the tables and we had a little male nudity to balance all the female nudity in Hollywood. I thought that was an inspired choice.

This summer, the social media giant reached 500 million users \u2013 a \u201cthrill\u201d because it\u2019s a feat not a lot of apps have actually reached, said Charles Porch, the company\u2019s head of global creative programs.\u00a0 \u201cI think what\u2019s happened on Instagram is that we\u2019ve really become this community that\u2019s organizing around shared interests and shared passions,\u201d Porch told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d Thursday. \u201cPeople are really forming these really strong ties and it keeps propelling the community forward, and it\u2019s really helping the growth on the platform.\u201d  Instagram has also became a major platform for sharing news, from the tragic shooting at an Orlando nightclub to the historic presidential election.  For example, Instagram account \u201ctheworldwidetribe\u201d puts a face to the refugee crisis. Jaz O\u2019Hara, a British fashion student, started the account by capturing life inside a refugee camp in France. Now with over 20,000 followers, O\u2019Hara has documented the needs of refugees all over the Middle East and Europe.  UPDATE from @kelsas in Turkey: We have now delivered 425 more blankets to people living in the rural areas outside Izmir. This brings the total number of blankets delivered to 2,000! At just under \u00a35 each (they are huge and thick..this little babe can't even pick one up haha), we've spent the whole fundraiser pot... but there are new families arriving from Syria every day. Mattresses to sleep on are still needed and these cost \u00a35 each too. We need at least another 1,000. Instead of a pressie, consider buying someone a mattress or blanket for Christmas this year. It will only cost you \u00a35 and it might just allow one of these Syrian cuties and their parents the good night's sleep they so desperately deserve \u263a\ufe0f the link is in my bio \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\u2764\ufe0f A photo posted by Jaz O'Hara | Worldwide Tribe (@theworldwidetribe) on Nov 28, 2016 at 11:47pm PST  Part 2/3 \"The smugglers squeezed me into the back of a truck with 40 others and we crossed the Sahara desert to the Libyan coast.  We had no food and no water. I didn\u2019t eat for 12 days but I didn\u2019t feel hungry, just desperately thirsty. The smugglers made all of us share one bottle of water a day. They put petrol in it so you could only drink a little bit at a time, to stop us from gulping it down in desperate thirst. I thought I was going to die in that truck but I made it to the sea, 8 months pregnant.  Here, on the Libyan coast, I slept on the floor on a huge warehouse with many many other people. I had not seen a doctor for my entire pregnancy. The only water we had was very dirty. I didn\u2019t know what would be better, to drink it and help my desperate thirst, or not to drink it because it was so unclean. Finally we were given some food here, pasta. We all ate from one plate. We were so hungry we burnt our hands on the food, within seconds it was gone.  One morning it was finally my turn and I was packed onto oldest, scariest looking boat I have ever seen. I can\u2019t swim. We got on with no food and no water, and any belongings we had left were thrown overboard to make more space for other passengers.  It was too full for me to sit down. My body was heavy and tired, everything hurt. Many people were crying but I just felt numb, I had to keep moving forward. It had to get better than this. It couldn\u2019t get worse. But then it did. We had been out at sea for two days when the contractions started. At first I tried to hold it in, but before long I could not help but scream in pain. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I tried to stop them coming, but I had to push. I was so so scared. Some of the women on the boat held my hand and stroked my hair. They helped me give birth to my boys. The men didn\u2019t know where to look! The boys were so tiny. I had no towel, nothing to wrap them in, nothing at all. We continued to float aimlessly in the sea as I held my new babies in my arms, totally helpless, praying for a miracle, praying to be saved.\" A photo posted by Jaz O'Hara | Worldwide Tribe (@theworldwidetribe) on Sep 6, 2016 at 1:08pm PDT Of its 500 million active users, over 80 percent are from outside the U.S. That includes perhaps one of the most famous global celebrities: Pope Francis.

            "article_content": "BERLIN -- President Obama is stressing a message of solidarity and trans-Atlantic cooperation on his final visit Thursday to Germany -- a top trade partner, key NATO ally and home to thousands of American troops, as well as a nation critical to solving Europe\u2019s migrant crisis and debt woes. CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan reports that two other names were looming large over President Obama\u2019s meetings in Berlin; Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 President-elect Trump\u2019s rhetoric and friendly outreach to Russia has German Chancellor Angela Merkel and many others in her country -- and across Europe -- concerned. Her foreign minister went so far as to call Mr. Trump a \u201cpreacher of hate.\u201d Mr. Obama arrived Wednesday night in Berlin from Greece, making his sixth and final visit as president to Germany, where he has been popular since even before he was elected. His eight years in office have helped erase much of the anti-American sentiment that had grown during the administration of George W. Bush over the Iraq war and other policies. Merkel, who worked well with Bush before Mr. Obama\u2019s election, dined with the president Wednesday night at his hotel and was to hold talks with him Thursday afternoon. The downtown area around the Chancellery and hotel where Mr. Obama was staying was locked down tightly, with some 2,400 police officers on hand manning road blocks and checkpoints. In a joint opinion piece published Thursday in Germany\u2019s weekly business magazine Wirtschaftwoche, which seemed directed as much at the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. as European nations, the two leaders stressed that the \u201cunderlying bedrock of our shared values is strong\u201d even if the pursuit of common goals is sometimes gone about differently. Mr. Obama and Merkel noted that European Union-U.S. trade was the largest between any two partners worldwide, and emphasized that the trans-Atlantic friendship has helped forge a climate accord, provide help for refugees worldwide, form a collective defense under NATO, and strengthen the global fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). \u201cThat friendship is based on our shared commitment to personal freedom and dignity, which only a vibrant democracy under the rule of law can guarantee,\u201d the leaders wrote. Merkel and Mr. Obama have enjoyed a close relationship over the years, and Mr. Obama seems to be counting on the German leader\u2019s strength to help counter the isolationist tone voiced by president-elect Donald Trump during the election campaign. Although the relationship hit a bump in 2013 when it was revealed the U.S. National Security Agency had been monitoring the chancellor\u2019s cell phone, tensions were smoothed over after President Obama acknowledged Germany\u2019s anger and promised new guidelines for monitoring. When Mr. Obama first visited the German capital in 2008, some 200,000 exuberant fans packed the road between the landmark Brandenburg Gate and Victory Column to hear the then-candidate, in a speech that solidified his place on the world stage. In a city where President John F. Kennedy in 1963 pledged steadfast American support for Germany against the Soviet bloc with his iconic \u201cIch bin ein Berliner\u201d speech and President Ronald Reagan in 1987 challenged then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to \u201ctear down this wall,\u201d Mr. Obama told Berliners that true progress requires sacrifice and shared burdens among allies. \u201cThat is why America cannot turn inward,\u201d he told the cheering crowd. \u201cThat is why Europe cannot turn inward.\u201d Eight years later, his words seem to have foreshadowed the nationalist, isolationist forces gaining traction in some parts of Europe and punctuated by Trump\u2019s victory in the U.S. election. In Germany, officials have been outspokenly hopeful that the change in presidents will not signal a significant shift in relations between the two nations or the NATO alliance. \u201cThe Americans are among ...\u00a0 our most important partners and we want to continue this partnership economically, politically and through shared values,\u201d Peter Tauber, the general secretary of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Party, told reporters in Berlin, ahead of Mr. Obama\u2019s visit. \u201cI think one will see that Mr. Trump will have his own political suggestions, but that the USA won\u2019t be a different country tomorrow.\u201d White House aides had hoped Mr. Obama might be able to return to the Brandenburg Gate, where he spoke in 2013, for a symbolic visit on his last trip to Germany, but the visit didn\u2019t materialize. Overall, the celebratory nature of the U.S. president\u2019s final world tour has been significantly tamped down in light of the U.S. election results. In Berlin, Mr. Obama will also meet Friday with the leaders of France, Italy, Spain and Britain. He\u2019s expected to address Mr. Trump\u2019s election and the direction the U.S. might take in the next four years. Merkel already talked with Mr. Trump by phone after his election, offering him Germany\u2019s \u201cclose cooperation,\u201d but emphasized it would be on the basis of what she said were shared values of \u201cdemocracy, freedom, respect for the law and for the dignity of human beings, independently of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views.\u201d In addition to the U.S. election, Mr. Obama and Merkel are expected to discuss a wide range of issues behind closed doors, including joint efforts to resolve the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, the fight against ISIS and trans-Atlantic trade. Mr. Obama traveled to Berlin from Greece, which has been at the center of Europe\u2019s debt crisis, and the president was also expected to encourage some sort of debt forgiveness for the country -- something the International Monetary Fund has lobbied for but Germany and several other nations oppose. The refugee issue is also at the top of the agenda on Mr. Obama\u2019s trip. Greece was the entry point to Europe for hundreds of thousands of migrants last year. Germany has taken in the vast majority with some 1.1 million arrivals since the start of 2015.",

            "article_content": "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis warned against what he called a \u201cvirus of polarization\u201d and hostility in the world targeting people of different nationalities, races or beliefs, as he led a ceremony Saturday giving the Roman Catholic Church 17 new cardinals from six continents. The consistory ceremony in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica formally inducted the churchmen into the cardinals\u2019 ranks. Francis used his homily to also caution the new \u201cprinces of the church,\u201d as cardinals are sometimes called, to guard against animosity creeping into the church as well, saying \u201cwe are not immune from this.\u201d The pope spoke of \u201cour pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose and condemn\u201d and cautioned somberly against those who \u201craise walls, build barriers and label people.\u201d Earlier this year, when asked about the plan by Donald Trump, then a Republican U.S. presidential candidate and now president-elect, to build a wall to keep Mexicans and others from illegally entering the U.S., the pope replied that anyone advocating building walls isn\u2019t a Christian. Francis, in a message a few days earlier to U.S. bishops, had urged them to help heal a society facing growing polarization. On Saturday, after receiving his red hat, Mexican Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes, archbishop of Tlalnepantla, expressed concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, including deporting large numbers of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, soon after assuming the presidency. \u201cYou can\u2019t divide a family. You can\u2019t divide a community. You can\u2019t divide the world,\u201d the prelate said in reply to a question by The Associated Press about Trump. The Mexican churchman added: \u201cOne thing is the election campaign. Another thing is reality.\u201d In Saturday\u2019s homily, Francis commented on how \u201cwe see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. An enemy because of the color of their skin, their language, or social class.\u201d He added: \u201cThe virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting.\u201d Francis also lamented the tendency to \u201cdemonize\u201d one\u2019s opponents, \u201cso as to have a \u2018sacred\u2019 justification for dismissing them.\u201d Cardinals serve as papal advisers and someday elect popes\u2019 successors. Popes look to cardinals who share their approach to the church\u2019s mission in the world. Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin is among the newly made cardinals. Tobin defied the governor of the U.S. state of Indiana, Mike Pence, by welcoming Syrian refugees. Tobin in January will become archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, while Pence will be installed as U.S. vice president. CBS News correspondent Seth Doane asked Tobin if the pope\u2019s message was a political statement aimed at America. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if it had anything to do with the U.S. election because I think you can see similar movements in many parts of the world,\u201d Tobin told Doane. Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich, after being made a cardinal at Saturday\u2019s ceremony, said the church has a special role in trying to bring people together across the political spectrum. He noted that on Sunday, Masses are celebrated in 26 languages in his diocese. \u201cPeople feel disenfranchised\u201d from sharing in the common good, the cardinal said in an interview with The Associated Press. Another American in the latest crop of cardinals is Irish-born Archbishop Kevin Farrell, who led the Dallas diocese before Francis appointed him to head the Vatican office dealing with family issues. At a post-ceremony reception, Farrell acknowledged that polarization is felt within the church, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve become gods on both sides - gods on the left, and gods on the right, and neither one of these are correct,\u201d Farrell told an AP reporter. The clash of mentalities between the conservative camps and the so-called progressives chosen by Francis has played out publicly in recent days. Four prominent, disgruntled cardinals, including a U.S. prelate, Raymond Burke, who is one of Francis\u2019 most vocal critics, in a letter to the pope aired their doubts about his more compassionate approach to the contentious issue involving divorced Catholics. They fear his approach could sow confusion among the faithful. Church teaching forbids divorce, and says Catholics who remarry without annulments of their earlier marriage are essentially adulterers who can\u2019t receive communion. In a document earlier this year, Francis suggested that clerics could decide case-by-case if these Catholics could receive Communion. Farrell, asked about the tensions over the divorce issue, appeared to be open toward the pope\u2019s prescription for more compassion. \u201cThere is no situation in life that\u2019s black and white. Anybody that\u2019s lived in this world will have encountered those situations in their personal lives,\u201d Farrell said. The new cardinals, who pledged loyalty to the pope, come from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America. One of them, an 88-year-old Albanian priest, Ernest Simoni, spent 18 years in prison because of his faith during the communist regime in his homeland. Since cardinals are usually bishops already, Francis bestowed a rare honor in giving that rank to Simoni, a simple priest. When Francis visited Albania in 2014, he was brought to tears when Simoni told him how he was persecuted. The pope\u2019s envoy to Syria is now Cardinal Mario Zenari. The Italian archbishop remarked how the bright crimson hue of the cardinals\u2019 cassocks and of the square, peaked headgear evokes the color of the blood spilled by innocent children killed in the five-year-old civil war there. Also among the new cardinals is Archbishop Dieudonne Nzapalainga, of Bangui, Central African Republic. Last year, Francis visited Nzapalainga\u2019s country, bloodied by sectarian violence between Christian and Muslim militants. Thirteen of the 17 new cardinals are under 80 years old and thus eligible to vote in a secret conclave for the next pope. Francis has now appointed 44 of the 120 cardinals young enough to elect his successor. The others were named by the previous two pontiffs, John Paul II, whom Francis made a saint, and Benedict XVI, who retired in 2013, and generally reflect a more conservative leaning on church issues. After the ceremony, the new cardinals and Francis took minibuses to the monastery on Vatican grounds where Benedict lives so they could greet him. One of the cardinals, an 87-year-old bishop from Lesotho, Africa, was too frail to come to Rome for the ceremony.",

            "article_content": "\u00a0ATHENS, Greece Pushing back against the forces of isolationism, President Obama stood at the birthplace of democracy on Wednesday and declared it\u2019s time for a \u201ccourse correction\u201d to ensure that the benefits of technology and globalization are more broadly shared. Reducing inequality, he said, creates societies where people are \u201cless likely to turn on each other, less likely to appeal to some of the darker forces\u201d that tear people apart. With the U.S. presidential election of Republican Donald Trump laying bare frustrations and dissatisfaction in America, Mr. Obama acknowledged the forces that would try to turn the clock back. \u201c[T]here are at times movements from both the left and the right to put a stop to integration, and to push back against technology, and to try to bring back jobs and industries that have been disappearing for decades,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a speech to the Greek people at the end of the first leg of his farewell foreign tour as president. \u201cSo this impulse to pull back from a globalized world is understandable.\u00a0 If people feel that they\u2019re losing control of their future, they will push back.\u201d But he had this message to leaders and people around the globe: \u201cWe can\u2019t look backward for answers, we have to look forward.\u201d\u00a0 The president said the path to more inclusive economies is known, but \u201cwe too often don\u2019t have the political will or desire to get it done.\u201d Workers, he said, must have \u201cmore leverage and better wages,\u201d and he added that we have to invest more in our young people, encourage entrepreneurship and modernize our infrastructure.\u00a0 \u201cWe cannot sever the connections that have enabled so much progress,\u201d Obama said. Obama cited both last week\u2019s election of Trump and the June vote by Britain to leave the European Union as evidence of the inclination to pull back. \u201cThe current path of globalization demands a course correction,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the years and decades ahead, our countries have to make sure that the benefits of an integrated global economy are more broadly shared by more people and that the negative impacts are squarely addressed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how democracies can deliver the prosperity and hope that our people need,\u201d Obama said. Before Trump\u2019s victory, Obama\u2019s speech to the Greeks had been envisioned to be a capstone moment for his presidency, harking back to the origins of democracy as he expected to hand off to fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton. Instead, Obama\u2019s legacy is in doubt as Trump prepares to take power and promises to undo much of the president\u2019s agenda. Obama spoke out in defense of his agenda: the Iran-nuclear deal, a global climate change pact, establishing relations with Cuba and more. \u201cThe next American president and I could not be more different,\u201d Obama said. But, he said, \u201cdemocracy is bigger than any one person.\u201d He renewed his pledge to ensure a peaceful transition despite his differences with Trump. Obama\u2019s words are being watched closely by world leaders. They see parallels between Trump\u2019s ascension and the rise of far-right and populist movements in their own countries amid continued economic anxiety. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras won elections last year on what critics say was a populist platform, though one on the left of the political spectrum. He pushed his formerly small radical left party onto the forefront by telling Greeks weary from six years of financial crisis and falling living standards that he would reject austerity measures imposed in return for the country\u2019s bailouts. But after the near collapse of negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors - other European countries using the euro currency, and the International Monetary Fund - Tsipras performed a political about-face: He signed up to a new bailout and more austerity to prevent his country being forced out of the euro. Before Obama\u2019s speech, he toured Greece\u2019s most famous ancient monument, the Acropolis citadel. Obama passed through the Propylaea, the monumental gateway that serves as an entrance to the site, and walked along the Parthenon temple, which is dedicated to the goddess Athena, considered the patron of Athens. The U.S. president lingered at the base of the Parthenon, gazing at the columns and glancing around at the panoramic view of Athens as he chatted with his guide, Eleni Banou of the Culture Ministry\u2019s antiquities division. The 5th century B.C. temple is surrounded these days by scaffolding as part of a maintenance project. The entire site was closed to the public for the day for Obama\u2019s visit, which has taken place amid stringent security measures. Demonstrations were banned in parts of Athens, and road and subway stations were shut down for the first official visit of a sitting U.S. president since Bill Clinton came in 1999. Greece\u2019s government hoped Obama would help persuade some of Greece\u2019s more reluctant international creditors to grant debt relief, and pressure other European countries to share more of the burden of the continent\u2019s refugee crisis. Obama was receptive to Greece\u2019s woes and repeated his belief that debt relief is necessary. He said Greece must continue putting in place painful reforms it signed up to in return for successive international bailouts. It is questionable how much of this stance will also be adopted by Trump. Greece is struggling to deal with hundreds of thousands of refugees who have crossed Greece\u2019s borders on their way to more prosperous European countries. A reluctance by many other EU countries to host refugees has left more than 60,000 people stranded in Greece. Many are living in poor conditions in massively overcrowded camps. Obama said the Greeks cannot be expected to bear the bulk of the burden on their own. It demands \u201ca truly collective response by Europe and the world,\u201d he said. Obama\u2019s next stop on his final foreign tour is Germany, followed by Peru.",

            "article_content": "BERLIN -- President Barack Obama used a meeting with key European leaders Friday to urge them to work with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump and to discuss steps necessary to resolve the conflicts in Syria and eastern Ukraine, the White House said. Obama\u2019s meeting with the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Spain was likely his last in such a setting before he leaves office. The session expands on lengthy talks he held the day before with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Obama didn\u2019t speak with reporters before departing for Peru on Air Force One. The White House said Obama thanked his counterparts for their cooperation during his two terms in office. He urged them to work on common challenges with a Trump administration on the \u201cbasis of the core values that define the United States and Europe as open democracies.\u201d Since Obama\u2019s arrival on Wednesday on his sixth and last trip to Germany as president, he and Merkel have focused several meetings on issues of globalization and trans-Atlantic cooperation. The talks come largely in the context of what the election of Trump will mean to efforts to seek peace in Ukraine and Syria, the strength of the NATO alliance, trade agreements, efforts to fight climate change, and other pressing matters. The White House said in a summary of the meeting that the leaders expressed grave concern about the humanitarian situation in Aleppo. They agreed that increased attacks by the Syrian regime and its supporters, including Russia and Iran, should be immediately halted. They also are calling for humanitarian access to the city to be restored. On Ukraine, the White House said the leaders agreed that sanctions against Russia must remain in place until it meets its commitments to resolving the conflict. Obama also briefed his counterparts on the progress made in Iraq in liberating Mosul from Islamic State militants. The White House said the leaders agreed on the need for stability after the city is liberated. Obama also encouraged leaders to continue efforts to expand information sharing throughout the European Union to help disrupt terror attacks. At a news conference with Obama on Thursday, Merkel diplomatically said she was approaching the incoming Trump administration \u201cwith an open mind.\u201d Around the world, many are looking to Merkel - one of the longest serving leaders of a major world power, leader of Europe\u2019s largest economy and one of the biggest U.S. trade partners with the U.S. - for leadership as Obama leaves office. Obama seemed to underscore that reality as he effusively thanked Merkel for her \u201cdeep friendship.\u201d He said he couldn\u2019t \u201cask for a steadier or more reliable partner on the world stage,\u201d while adding that if she chooses to run again for a fourth term next year, he\u2019d vote for her - if he could. Joining the two leaders Friday were the heads of countries at the center of many of the European Union\u2019s coming challenges. British Prime Minister Theresa May is preparing her country for negotiations to leave the trade bloc. Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy faces economic woes in his country that have contributed to financial instability in the EU. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s already shaky economy has been rocked by tens of thousands of refugees. And French President Francois Hollande\u2019s socialist government faces a major challenge from the far-right in elections next year. Trump has applauded the British decision to exit the EU, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d and has had meetings with Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party and a key player in the British decision to leave. For his part, Obama said Thursday his hope was that the Brexit negotiations be \u201cconducted in a smooth and orderly and transparent fashion and preserve as closely as possible the economic and political and security relationships between the UK and EU.\u201d Still, Obama noted that he considered the EU \u201cone of the world\u2019s great political and economic achievements.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Vice President-elect Mike Pence has a long history as an anti-abortion crusader. As Indiana governor, he signed one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the country. So why is\u00a0Planned Parenthood suddenly being flooded with donations in his name? Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky (PPINK) said Tuesday that in the week since Election Day, the organization has received a whopping 1,400 donations \u2014 a total of $25,000 \u2014 \u201cfrom\u201d Vice President-elect Pence. The donations have actually been made by abortion-rights supporters in a collective effort to make a statement by deluging Pence\u2019s office with thank you notes. Unlike President-elect Donald Trump, whose stances on abortion and women\u2019s health have wavered over the years, Pence\u2019s position has long been clear.\u00a0 When he served in Congress, Pence was known for single-mindedly tackling social issues like abortion. In 2011, he\u00a0spearheaded the effort to defund Planned Parenthood. In March, Pence, as governor,\u00a0signed a bill preventing women from obtaining an abortion because of a fetus\u2019 genetic abnormalities. A federal judge\u00a0blocked the Indiana law in June, saying that the state does not have the authority to limit a woman\u2019s reasons for deciding to end a pregnancy. Now people who disagree with Pence\u2019s views are taking action by writing checks. The surge of generous donations comes after social media users and celebrities, including \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d host John Oliver and comedian Amy Schumer, encouraged people to make donations to charitable organizations that oppose the Trump agenda. \u201cWe\u2019re going to actively stand up for one another,\u201d Oliver said during his post-election show. \u201cI\u2019m talking about actual sacrifice to support people who are now under threat.\u201d Oliver then suggested people donate to organizations like Planned Parenthood, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the International Refugee Assistance Project, and the Center for Reproductive Rights in the names of their pro-Trump relatives. WARNING: This video contains profanity. Schumer took a snarkier approach, sharing a post with her 5.3 million Instagram followers suggesting that people actually make the donations in Pence\u2019s name. \u201cYou can make a donation to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence\u2019s name and he\u2019ll receive the certificate of the donation,\u201d the post said.  Done and done @ppact A photo posted by @amyschumer on Nov 12, 2016 at 11:39am PST \u201cDone and done,\u201d Schumer wrote. From there, the movement started taking off, and PPINK couldn\u2019t be happier. \u201cWe are pleased that this outpouring of support recognizes the good work PPINK does and we welcome the financial support to continue to serve our patients who need us the most,\u201d Betty Cockrum, President and CEO of PPINK, said in a statement provided to CBS News. \u201cHoosiers have recognized how bad Pence is for women for a really long time and now the nation is joining us in the fight against him.\u201d\u00a0 PPINK confirmed that Pence will receive notifications of the donations made in his honor at his office in the Indiana Statehouse. The office of Indiana Governor Mike Pence told CBS News they have no comment.",

An unidentified individual yelled \u201cgun\u201d while Trump was speaking, the Secret Service said in a statement. Secret Service agents and Reno police detained the man and after a thorough search, did not find a gun, the statement said.\u00a0 That was very chaotic. Trump was just rushed off stage by Secret Service. Fights started breaking out in the crowd. Not sure why. CBS News producer Arden Farhi said it all happened very quickly, but it appeared their was a commotion near the podium.\u00a0 Trump returned to the stage shortly afterward, and said \u201cnobody said it was going to be easy for us. But we will never be stopped. Never, ever be stopped.\u201d He thanked the Secret Service and then returned to his speech.\u00a0 The Reno rally was a last-minute trip to the swing state. It was his third rally on Saturday in the last, long weekend before Election Day.\u00a0 Trump began speaking just before 5:30 p.m., according to CBS affiliate KTVN. Looking specifically at Reno, Trump said that \u201cReno and northern Nevada can carry this thing.\u201d He continued to say in regards to Tuesday\u2019s vote, \u201cIt\u2019s up to the great people of Washoe County to get this done.\u201d Then he spoke against the man who he called \u201cCrazy Harry\u201d, Senator Harry Reid. However he did not endorse any candidate to take his place.\u00a0 Other talking points included the \u201crigged system\u201d and the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Later on, Trump also spoke about healthcare, saying as president he would begin by \u201ccompletely repealing and replacing Obamacare\u201d. Switching to international policy, he said he would \u201csuspend the Syrian refugee problem\u201d and keep \u201cradical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.\u201d Then began speaking about building the wall, the \u201cgreat wall\u201d at Mexico\u2019s border, emphasizing that he would let people in legally.

            "article_content": "MAIDUGURI, Nigeria -- Nigerian troops rescued one of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram extremists more than two years ago in a pre-dawn raid Saturday on a forest hideout. She had a 10-month-old baby boy born to a Boko Haram fighter, said a statement from army spokesman Col. Sani Kukasheka Usman. It was the first army rescue of a Chibok girl. Last month, Nigeria\u2019s government secured the freedom of 21 of the Chibok schoolgirls in the first such release negotiated with Boko Haram. Another girl escaped in May on her own. Thousands of other Boko Haram captives have been freed this year as the military has forced the extremists out of towns and villages in northeastern Nigeria, where they had declared an Islamic caliphate. But until Saturday, none proved to be among the 276 schoolgirls seized from northeastern Chibok town in April 2014. Dozens of them escaped within hours. President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to secure the release of the nearly 200 schoolgirls who remain captive. The failures of successive governments and security forces to free the girls brought international condemnation and the creation of a movement called Bring Back Our Girls. U.S. first lady Michelle Obama posted a picture of herself under that hashtag and vowed her husband would do everything in his power to help bring the girls home. Former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s initial refusal even to admit the girls had been taken hostage, losing precious days after their capture, contributed to his loss in the 2015 elections. Meanwhile, activists and relatives have objected to the government\u2019s prolonged holding of Amina Ali Nkeki, the girl who escaped in May. She says she wants to be reunited with her mother and the father of her child, a detained Boko Haram extremist whom she says also was a victim of kidnapping and helped her escape. The government says she is receiving trauma counseling and other care at a military hospital in Abuja, where she has been joined by the girls released last month. Human rights activists have protested against the prolonged military screening of escapees from Boko Haram that has kept thousands held in detention, where Amnesty International has reported babies are among those dying from inhumane conditions. Some 20,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram\u2019s seven-year Islamic uprising that has spread across borders and forced 2.6 million refugees from their homes.",

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon, the chief strategist and right-hand man to President-elect Donald Trump, denied in an interview that he was an advocate of white nationalism -- and gave hints instead about how his brand of \u201ceconomic\u201d nationalism will shake up Washington.  In The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon, the controversial former head of Breitbart News who went on to chair Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, discussed why he believed his candidate won the election.  \u201cI\u2019m not a white nationalist, I\u2019m a nationalist. I\u2019m an economic nationalist,\u201d Bannon told the news outlet earlier this week. \u201cThe globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f\u2014ed over.\u201d Bannon\u2019s appointment to the White House has drawn criticism from Democrats and several civil liberties groups, in part because of his (and Breitbart\u2019s) strong association with the alt-right, a political movement with strains of white supremacy. In the past, the former Breitbart CEO has admitted the alt-right\u2019s connections to racist and anti-Semitic agendas. \u201cLook, are there some people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right? Maybe,\u201d Bannon told Mother Jones in August. \u201cAre there some people that are anti-Semitic that are attracted? Maybe. Right? Maybe some people are attracted to the alt-right that are homophobes, right? But that\u2019s just like, there are certain elements of the progressive left and the hard left that attract certain elements.\u201d In the Reporter interview, Bannon challenged the notion that racialized overtones dominated the Trump campaign on the trail. He predicted that if the administration delivered on its election promises, \u201cwe\u2019ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we\u2019ll govern for 50 years.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s everything related to jobs,\u201d Bannon said and seemingly bragged about how he was going to drive conservatives \u201ccrazy\u201d with his \u201ctrillion-dollar infrastructure plan.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWith negative interest rates throughout the world, it\u2019s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up,\u201d he proposed. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution \u2014 conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.\u201d Bannon, in the Reporter interview, also gave some insight into how he viewed his political foes (presumably, liberals and the media) -- and the \u201cdarkness\u201d he touts in fighting against them. \u201cDarkness is good,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cDick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That\u2019s power. It only helps us when they...get it wrong. When they\u2019re blind to who we are and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",

            "article_content": "PELHAM, N.C. - In today\u2019s racially charged environment, there\u2019s a label that even the KKK disavows: white supremacy. Standing on a muddy dirt road in the dead of night near the North Carolina-Virginia border, masked Ku Klux Klan members claimed Donald Trump\u2019s election as president proves whites are taking back America from blacks, immigrants, Jews and other groups they describe as criminals and freeloaders. America was founded by and for whites, they say, and only whites can run a peaceful, productive society. But still, the KKK members insisted in an interview with The Associated Press, they\u2019re not white supremacists, a label that is gaining traction in the country since Mr. Trump won with the public backing of the Klan, neo-Nazis and other white racists. \u201cWe\u2019re not white supremacists. We believe in our race,\u201d said a man with a Midwestern accent and glasses just hours before a pro-Trump Klan parade in a nearby town. He, like three Klan compatriots, wore a robe and pointed hood and wouldn\u2019t give his full name, in accordance with Klan rules. Claiming the Klan isn\u2019t white supremacist flies in the face of its very nature. The Klan\u2019s official rulebook, the Kloran - published in 1915 and still followed by many groups - says the organization \u201cshall ever be true in the faithful maintenance of White Supremacy,\u201d even capitalizing the term for emphasis. Watchdog groups also consider the Klan a white supremacist organization, and experts say the groups\u2019 denials are probably linked to efforts to make their racism more palatable. Still, KKK groups today typically renounce the term. The same goes for extremists including members of the self-proclaimed \u201calt-right,\u201d an extreme branch of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism. \u201cWe are white separatists, just as Yahweh in the Bible told us to be. Separate yourself from other nations. Do not intermix and mongrelize your seed,\u201d said one of the Klansmen who spoke along the muddy lane. The Associated Press interviewed the men, who claimed membership in the Loyal White Knights of the KKK, in a nighttime session set up with help of Chris Barker, a KKK leader who confirmed details of the group\u2019s \u201cTrump victory celebration\u201d in advance of the event. As many as 30 cars paraded through the town of Roxboro, North Carolina, some bearing Confederate and KKK flags. Barker didn\u2019t participate, though: He and a Klan leader from California were arrested hours earlier on charges linked to the stabbing of a third KKK member during a fight, sheriff\u2019s officials said. Both men were jailed; the injured man was recovering. Like the KKK members, Don Black said he doesn\u2019t care to be called a white supremacist, either. Black - who operates stormfront.org, a white extremist favorite website, from his Florida home - he prefers \u201cwhite nationalist.\u201d \u201cWhite supremacy is a legitimate term, though not usually applicable as used by the media. I think it\u2019s popular as a term of derision because of the implied unfairness, and, like \u2018racism,\u2019 it\u2019s got that \u2018hiss\u2019 (and, like \u2018hate\u2019 and \u2018racism,\u2019 frequently \u2018spewed\u2019 in headlines),\u201d Black said in an email interview. The Klan formed 150 years ago, just months after the end of the Civil War, and quickly began terrorizing freed blacks. Hundreds of people were assaulted or killed as whites tried to regain control of the defeated Confederacy. During the civil rights movement, Klan members were convicted of using murder as a weapon against equality. Leaders from several different Klan groups have told AP they have rules against violence aside from self-defense, and opponents agree the KKK has toned itself down after a string of members went to prison years after the fact for deadly arson attacks, beatings, bombings and shootings. The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, which monitor white extremist organizations and are tracking an increase in reports of racist incidents since the election, often use the \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d label when describing groups like the Klan; white nationalism and white separatism are parts of the ideology. But what exactly is involved? The ADL issued a report last year describing white supremacists as \u201cideologically motivated by a series of racist beliefs, including the notion that whites should be dominant over people of other backgrounds, that whites should live by themselves in a whites-only society, and that white people have their own culture and are genetically superior to other cultures.\u201d That sounds a lot like some of the ideas espoused by today\u2019s white radicals, yet they reject the label. That\u2019s likely because they learned the lessons of one-time Klan leader David Duke, who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana this year, said Penn State University associate professor Josh Inwood. \u201c(There was) this peddling of kinder, softer white supremacy. He tried to pioneer a more respectable vision of the Klan,\u201d Inwood said. Extremist expert Sophie Bjork-James, a scholar at Vanderbilt University, prefers the term \u201cracist right\u201d to describe today\u2019s white supremacists. \u201cThey are not simply conservative or alt-right, but actually espousing racist ideas and racist goals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey won\u2019t agree with this label, but I think it is important to be clear about what they represent and what their goals are.\u201d Whatever you call them, the muddy-road Klansmen said their beliefs have gained a foothold. The popularity of Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall on the Mexican border - an idea long espoused by the Klan - is part of the proof, they said. \u201cWhite Americans are finally, most of them, opening their eyes and coming around and seeing what is happening,\u201d said a man in a satiny green Klan robe.",

He will be getting that chance, potentially dealing a massive blow to participants in the federal health care program and to President Obama\u2019s legacy.\u00a0Is the Affordable Care Act living on borrowed time? Everyone knows about Trump\u2019s planned crackdown on illegal immigrants and criticism of global trade. But the president-elect\u2019s views on everyday pocketbook issues, such as taxes and interest rates, are less well-known. We fill in some of the blanks in four areas crucial to people\u2019s financial health. Donald Trump\u2019s brand of right-wing populism and economic nationalism is at work in more places than just the U.S. -- and parties espousing similar views could win elections in a handful of European countries in coming months. Hillary Clinton\u2019s emotional concession speech was praised as \u201cclassy\u201d and \u201cpoignant.\u201d She joins a select group of politicians who came up short in their quest for the White House. The losses can haunt them for months or even years. Take a look at how previous candidates have coped with stinging losses. Donald Trump will soon become familiar with some new real estate. The president-elect will move into the White House with his wife, Melania, and 10-year-old son, Barron. His adult children are expected to be frequent guests. See what we can expect from this unique first family. Commentary: To get a better idea about what\u2019s going on in America, the Washington press corps is going to have to embrace humility. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone that, with a few exceptions, its members were all tacitly or explicitly #WithHer (Hillary Clinton), which has led to a certain anguish in the face of Trump\u2019s victory.

            "article_content": "South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott praised President-Elect Donald Trump\u2019s decision to nominate Dr. Ben Carson to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), suggesting in an interview this week that the \u201cbrilliant\u201d neurosurgeon could bring a \u201cfresh perspective\u201d to the department. \u201cYou bring a guy who we all know is brilliant into a space without any set of preconceived ideas\u2026Someone who\u2019s done very well in life who actually lived in poverty and now is going to help other who live in the same place he lived in get better,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThat\u2019s good news for those folks living there.\u201d Carson, a former Republican presidential candidate, grew up poor in Detroit before going on to become one of the most prominent neurosurgeons in the country. Scott suggested that background may be helpful to Carson as he embarks on his new job.  \u201cAs a person born in Detroit, who has seen the revitalization happen in Detroit, I think he will take with a new lens the approach that is consistent with how do you rebuild some of the areas of our country that have to be rebuilt for our country the American family to prosper together? I think he will take a very conscientious approach,\u201d Scott predicted. The South Carolina Republican, who\u2019s currently the only black Republican in the Senate, mentioned one specific shortcoming at HUD that Carson may be able to address. \u201cSo many folks who are poor and looking for ways to improve their plight live in housing that has not been inspected for years. And yet there sits in an account millions of dollars waiting to be used for inspections,\u201d Scott explained. \u201cThe current administration has not done that. I think bringing in a fresh pair of eyes of someone who is going to be meticulous about the details is going to be very helpful. I think we\u2019ll see millions of dollars that have been sitting there used for inspections to improve the quality of life, to improve the quality of the living space of the folks that are living in HUD houses.\u201d Asked what he\u2019ll listen for during Carson\u2019s confirmation hearing, Scott replied, \u201cI want to know his vision for improving the use of the resources given to HUD, number one. Number two, how do you create a path that transitions people out of government subsidized housing into the free market?\u201d Scott also suggested that Trump\u2019s decision to tap Carson for the post signals that HUD will be a priority for his administration. \u201cOne of his closest allies in the last several months of the campaign was Ben Carson and to put one of your closest allies into such a strategic position I think sends an important signal that he is serious about improving the quality of life in the urban areas,\u201d the senator explained. In contrast to his effusive praise of Carson, Scott became notably more circumspect when he was asked about another of Mr. Trump\u2019s recent staffing picks \u2013 the selection of former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon as his chief strategist.  Critics have accused Bannon of stoking white nationalism, racism, and anti-semitism during his tenure at Breitbart, a right-wing news website. Scott, for his part, said he\u2019s never met Bannon, and he suggested he\u2019s reluctant to judge someone he doesn\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t know Mr. Bannon at all. Never met him. Never been to the Breibart site,\u201d Scott said. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard for me to comment on anything other than what I\u2019ve seen in the press. What I think we will have to do is judge the Trump administration by what comes out of the Trump administration and not the collective pieces.\u201d \u201cRight, but if Ben Carson sends a signal, surely then Bannon does as well,\u201d Face the Nation moderator John Dickerson said. \u201cWhat kind of a signal do you think that is?\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t tell you, to be honest with you,\u201d Scott replied. \u201cWhat I know about Ben Carson is through personal interaction, watching him on the campaign trail\u2026I\u2019m very cautious to have a conversation about someone [with] whom I have not had a conversation at all.\u201d For more of Dickerson\u2019s interview with Sen.

            "article_content": "Breitbart News, an ultraconservative website that has served as a platform for the white nationalist \u201calt-right\u201d movement, is touting its growing readership and \u201cmain street American values\u201d as a reason advertisers should stick with it.\u00a0 Some marketers, however, are heading for the exits, directing their advertising dollars away from Breitbart amid the publication\u2019s call for a boycott against Kellogg\u2019s (K), which has pulled its ads from the site. That prompted Breitbart to declare \u201cwar\u201d on Kellogg\u2019s: Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow said on the site that \u201cto blacklist Breitbart News in order to placate left-wing totalitarians is a disgraceful act of cowardice.\u201d Breitbart\u2019s campaign against Kellogg\u2019s is unusual on a number of fronts, not in the least because news organizations traditionally maintain a separation between their business operations and their editors and reporters so that journalists can operate independently from business interests.\u00a0 And whether the boycott will help Breitbart financially appears questionable, given that attacking a major advertiser isn\u2019t likely to make the site more appealing to other brands.\u00a0 \u201cReporters don\u2019t behave that way in the U.S., nor should they,\u201d said Lee Wilkins, professor and chair of the department of communications at Wayne State University, who\u2019s an expert in media ethics. \u201cMost journalistic organizations have checks between the people who pay for your news work and the news work itself, so that you are as a journalist protected from those influences.\u201d She said she views Breitbart as a blog rather than a journalistic organization. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t a journalism organization, then those safeguards are never in place.\u201d \u00a0 Other companies saying this week that they\u2019ll pull their ads from Breitbart include Vanguard, 3M (MMM) and AARP, among others. Kellogg\u2019s said it decided to remove its advertising because Breitbart didn\u2019t align with its values. It said the decision has \u201cnothing to do with politics.\u201d Stephen Bannon, Breitbart\u2019s former chairman, served on President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and is now set to become one of the incoming president\u2019s top advisers in the White House. Vanguard said it removed its ads as soon as it became aware that they were running on Breitbart. \u201cAs a policy, Vanguard does not advertise on any overtly political websites, including the site in question,\u201d a spokeswoman wrote in an email. She said the ads appeared as part of a \u201cremarketing\u201d program, which are ads that appear to clients and investors when they visit third-party websites because of their browsing history.\u00a0 \u201cOur remarketing advertisements are limited to pre-approved sites (again, no political sites), however it was brought to our attention last week that this site was inadvertently included,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Breitbart\u2019s advertiser showdown comes as the anti-Trump campaign #GrabYourWallet is taking aim at the site, officially adding it to its own boycott list on Thursday. #GrabYourWallet was created before the election by Sue Atencio, a 59-year-old grandmother, and marketing specialist Shannon Coulter, as a way to express concerns about Trump\u2019s boasts of sexual assault. Since his victory, the boycott of stores that sell Trump brands has picked up steam.\u00a0 \u201cBecause of the way digital advertising works, we\u2019re not yet adding companies that advertise on Bretibart to the boycott list,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them time to work with their media buyers and ad networks to ensure their ads no longer appear there.\u201d While Breitbart is billing Kellogg\u2019s decision as \u201cbigoted and anti-American,\u201d it\u2019s a well-established American business practice for corporations to shift their sponsorship to companies they believe will help bolster their brand. In the case of reaching conservative audiences, advertisers that exit Breitbart aren\u2019t necessarily snubbing those consumers because other conservative-leaning outlets, such as Fox News or Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze, have an overlap.\u00a0 \u201cThere are a lot of places advertisers can go to reach the same audience, and even maybe a bigger audience,\u201d Wilkins said.\u00a0 Nevertheless, Breitbart has been buidling its readership in the past year. Five Thirty Eight noted that its traffic has increased along with Trump\u2019s political career. While many news sites got a bump in traffic as the campaign heated up, Breitbart\u2019s growth was faster than other sites.\u00a0 Some Breitbart readers are joining the boycott with enthusiasm, tweeting statements such as \u201ccereal shouldn\u2019t be political\u201d with the hashtag #dumpkelloggs. At the same time, their message is generating pushback from internet wags who are creating satirical names under the hashtag #BreitbartCereals, such as \u201cRace Krispies\u201d and \u201cGrope Nut Flakes.\u201d Breitbart is \u201cbehaving stupidly,\u201d Wilkins said of the Kellogg\u2019s boycott. \u201cUnfortunately, we are all allowed to be stupid.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Lt.-Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.) has been offered the position of national security adviser by President-elect Donald Trump, CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett confirmed Thursday. Trump transition to the White House - live blog Flynn, a lifelong Democrat, is a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) -- he was one of the highest-ranking national security officials supporting Trump, whom he also informally advised him on foreign policy during the primary campaign. He is also known to be a proponent of stronger ties with Russia, as well as a critic of President Obama.\u00a0 Trump had at one point reportedly\u00a0considered Flynn for vice president before choosing Mike Pence. The Associated Press first reported that Flynn had been offered the post. U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee, issued a statement saying he is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Flynn\u2019s views on Russia, and questioned Flynn\u2019s \u201cuncritical acceptance\u201d of the Turkish crackdown on dissent. Schiff also criticized Flynn\u2019s \u201cinflammatory remarks\u201d about Muslims.\u00a0 Flynn, who turns 58 in December, built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. He retired in 2014 and has been a fierce critic of President Barack Obama\u2019s White House and Pentagon, taking issue with the administration\u2019s approach to global affairs and fighting ISIS. In February, Flynn had a controversial tweet about Muslims. In the tweet, he said fear of Muslims is rational.\u00a0 Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions... https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU Mr. Trump is a foreign policy novice and his early moves on national security are being closely watched by U.S allies and adversaries alike. He\u2019s said to be considering a range of officials with varying degrees of experience to lead the State Department and Pentagon.\u00a0 The president-elect also held his first face-to-face meeting with a world leader on Thursday, since winning the presidential election, huddling privately with Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe. While Mr. Trump made no comments following the meeting, Abe said the president-elect was \u201ca leader in whom I can have great confidence.\u201d  Mr. Trump also consulted with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and sat down with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a potential contender to lead the State Department.\u00a0 In Washington, Vice President-elect Mike Pence huddled with Republican leaders in Congress. He then met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the newly elected leader of the Senate Democrats, seeking to convey respect as Democrats prepare for Republican rule of both chambers and the White House for the first time in a decade.  \u201cWe look forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward,\u201d Pence said outside Schumer\u2019s Senate office.  In a separate gesture of reconciliation with establishment Republicans, Mr. Trump planned to meet with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who lambasted Mr. Trump as a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d in a stinging speech last March. Trump responded by repeatedly referring to Romney as a \u201closer.\u201d  The two began mending fences after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory when Romney called with congratulations. They are to meet this weekend, a transition official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss Mr. Trump\u2019s schedule publicly. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said they were still \u201cworking on\u201d the meeting.  Mr. Trump\u2019s actions Thursday aimed to show leaders both in the U.S. and overseas that he could soften his rhetoric, offer pragmatism in the White House and reaffirm longstanding American alliances. Since his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton last week, Mr. Trump has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and nearly three dozen other world leaders by telephone.\u00a0 Ron Dermer, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States, also visited the skyscraper and called Mr. Trump \u201ca true friend of Israel.\u201d He specifically cited as another \u201cfriend\u201d Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, whose selection as a top White House adviser has created a backlash among Democrats. Bannon\u2019s news website has peddled conspiracy theories, white nationalism and anti-Semitism.  \u201cWe look forward to working with the Trump administration, with all the members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, in making the U.S.-Israel alliance stronger than ever,\u201d Dermer said.  Mr. Trump, a reality television star, business mogul and political newcomer, also rolled out new teams that will interact with the State Department, Pentagon, Justice Department and other national security agencies. The move is part of the government transition before Mr. Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration.  Coordination had been on hold until Mr. Trump\u2019s team submitted documents including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest.  White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday, meaning agencies could start providing briefings and written materials to Mr. Trump\u2019s team. Indeed, the departments of State, Defense and Justice say meetings are being set up.\u00a0 Conway said she expected initial announcements of Cabinet choices to come \u201cbefore or right after Thanksgiving,\u201d telling reporters Mr. Trump he was \u201cloving\u201d the transition. \u201cHe\u2019s a transactional guy. He\u2019s somebody who\u2019s used to delivering results and producing.\u201d  One potential Cabinet member, Eva Moskowitz, said had taken herself out of the running to become education secretary. Moskowitz, a Democrat and advocate for charter schools, met with Mr. Trump this week, stoking speculation that she might inject a bit of bipartisanship in the new administration.  Moskowitz, who voted for Clinton, suggested there were \u201cpositive signs\u201d that Mr. Trump might govern differently than he campaigned, but she wrote in a letter to parents that many of her students, who are overwhelmingly black and Latino, would feel that \u201cthey are the target of the hatred that drove Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Police had to get involved Saturday afternoon, after a protest turned violent on Pennsylvania Avenue, CBS affiliate WUSA reports.\u00a0 Approximately 300 protesters were gathered outside of the Reagan building, to voice their concern with the National Policy Institute, a group that has been called Anti-Semitic, racist, and xenophobic. When two people, claiming to be NPI staff, entered the crowd with a camera, they were attacked by some members of the crowd. NPI was in town for an annual convention, which often invites protest. The protest this year was intensified due to the recent election, as many of the signs were anti-Trump as well. \u201cWhite nationalism is ugly,\u201d said Eric Hamlin, who was protesting. \u201cIt\u2019s gross.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a person of Jewish faith,\u201d said another protester, who went by Zay. \u201cI don\u2019t want any Nazis in my city. I don\u2019t want them in my country.\u201d The protest began peaceful, but turned violent when two advocates came out for NPI. Emily Youcis was joined by a photographer, as she tried to ask people in the crowd questions. \u201cDo you hate white people,\u201d she asked one protester. Shortly after the questioning began, a protester spray painted Youcis\u2019 hair. Minutes later, a fight broke out, as protesters appeared to have attacked the photographer. Police had to break the fight up, and the photographer was left with a bloody gash on his forehead. \u201cI think they\u2019re the racists here,\u201d Youcis said shortly after the attack. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been sprayed in the face, I\u2019ve been told to f*** off, they bloodied my cameraman, and stole his phone. They\u2019re the violent people.\u201d At least two protesters were put in handcuffs, although it\u2019s unclear if any arrests were made. Most of the protesters remained peaceful, although vocally against the organization. Many in the crowd began chanting monikers like \u201cNazi scum,\u201d \u201cwhite supremacists,\u201d or \u201cfascists\u201d when the duo tried to speak. After protesting outside of the Reagan building, the group marched to the Trump International Hotel, where it took on a political tone. While the primary target was NPI, there was plenty of anti-Trump chants as well. Pat Loveless, who decades ago lost six fingers in altercations with the KKK, said this fighting takes away from their message. \u201cNobody needs violence,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to solve anything. Because we\u2019re preaching against the same thing we\u2019re marching against.\u201d",

She and her campaign will hold a call Tuesday morning to address what\u2019s next.

Mr. Trump won the state by a margin of 22,748 votes, according to the newest totals from the Wisconsin Election Commission. Stein\u2019s campaign paid approximately $3.5 million for the Wisconsin recount. And in Pennsylvania, a federal judge ruled Monday morning against Stein\u2019s request for a review of the voting systems, saying it was possible they had been hacked and compromised. In his decision, federal judge Paul Diamond said Stein\u2019s allegation of possible election tampering \u201cborders on the irrational.\u201d Diamond also cited the delay between Election Day and Stein\u2019s decision to file the lawsuit, and said Stein didn\u2019t have standing to sue on the issue. \u201cGranting her later than last minute request for relief, however, could well ensure that no Pennsylvania vote counts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch a result would be both outrageous and completely unnecessary; as I have found, suspicion of a \u2018hacked\u2019 Pennsylvania election borders on the irrational.\u201d Stein could appeal the decision, but time is short: all states must certify their election results by this Tuesday, so it\u2019s unlikely any new action could be taken before then.  And in Michigan, the third state on Stein\u2019s list, the recount process ended last week after a judge lifted an order forcing the statewide review of ballots. The recount lasted three days, and examined ballots in 20 of the state\u2019s 83 counties. Stein first began raising money for a possible recount in late November, and quickly began bringing in millions of dollars for the effort. According to Stein\u2019s fundraising page, the effort has raised more than $7.3 million. Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "BANJUL, Gambia -- Gambia\u2019s opposition candidate has defeated longtime ruler Yahya Jammeh in the West African country\u2019s presidential vote, an upset victory that could lead to the first transfer of power in more than two decades, the head of the election commission announced Friday. Adama Barrow won 263,515 votes, or 45 percent of the total, while Jammeh finished in second with 36 percent, Alieu Momarr Njai said. A third candidate, Mama Kandeh, received 17 percent, he said. \u201cI hereby declare Adama Barrow duly elected president of the Republic of Gambia for the next five years,\u201d Njai said. He said Jammeh would be calling Barrow \u201cto congratulate him and pray for peace and tranquility.\u201d Jammeh himself had not issued a public statement by early afternoon. \u201cThere will be celebrations, there will be disappointment, but we all know we are all Gambia,\u201d Njai said, calling for peace, tolerance and tranquility to be respected as it was during campaigning. Gambians voted Thursday by placing marbles into drums marked for each candidate. Eight opposition parties united behind Barrow, a former businessman, and the campaign period featured large opposition rallies and unprecedented expressions of frustration with Jammeh\u2019s rule. Nevertheless, Jammeh had projected confidence, saying his victory was all but assured by God and predicting \u201cthe biggest landslide in the history of the country\u201d after he voted on Thursday. \u201cWe are happy to be free,\u201d said Omar Amadou Jallow, an opposition leader for the People\u2019s Progressive Party, which joined the coalition that backed Barrow. \u201cWe are able to free the Gambian people from the clutches of dictatorship, and we are now going to make sure Gambia becomes a bastion of peace and coalition. Our foundation will be based on national reconciliation.\u201d Jammeh came to power in a coup in 1994 and then swept elections in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011 after a 2002 constitutional amendment removed presidential term limits. Critics say those earlier elections were not free and fair. Human rights groups have accused Jammeh of ordering the deaths of countless political opponents as well as targeting journalists and gays and lesbians. All internet and international phone service was cut on election day in a bid by Jammeh to thwart unrest. If Jammeh agrees to step down peacefully, it would demonstrate that even Africa\u2019s most entrenched leaders can be brought down if opposition politicians overcome their divisions and unite, said Jeffrey Smith, a human rights activist and founding director of Vanguard Africa, a U.S.-based group that worked with Gambia\u2019s opposition coalition. \u201cThis is going to have resonance way beyond the tiny borders of Gambia,\u201d Smith said, describing the result as \u201ca momentous occasion for the region writ large.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s nearly impossible to sum up the year 2016 with a single word, phrase, or story. Dominated by political coverage and consumed with tragedy, there\u2019s little doubt that events of this year will go down in history for having a lasting impact on millions of people. Here are 16 stories that unfolded in 2016 which will surely reverberate into 2017 and far beyond.\u00a0 The narrative of the 2016 election seemed to set the tone for the entire year. Donald Trump\u2019s surprising win came at the end of a long, bitter campaign where both sides flung accusations of sexism, racism, lies, cover-ups, illegal activity, and even sexual assault.\u00a0 The country saw for the first time a political candidate who could change the entire conversation with a tap of his thumb and a tweet. And we saw our first female nominee of a major political party, Hillary Clinton. But it was the \u201cOctober surprises\u201d that ultimately came to dominate the story of the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s came in the form of a leaked \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, more than a decade old, in which he described groping women in offensive detail. Clinton\u2019s was a letter from FBI director James Comey to Congress updating the status of an investigation into her email server that didn\u2019t result in charges but never quite disappeared. Both story lines exemplify the dark clouds that hovered over each candidate throughout the race. Now, Americans are buckling up for the political roller-coaster ride that\u2019s likely to last for the next four years. The hacking of the Democratic National Committee before the convention in July was a game-changer that rocked the presidential race. The following email leaks exposed damaging and embarrassing information on the Democrats, creating a major headache for the Clinton campaign.\u00a0 But it increasingly became clear that the larger story was that the hack revealed America\u2019s vulnerabilities to countries like Russia. U.S. intelligence officials said the attack had Russian \u201cfingerprints,\u201d and as the investigation progressed their\u00a0confidence grew that Russia was directly involved with the intent of influencing the election. Most recently, officials said they believe Russian President Vladimir Putin himself ordered the hack. Although Donald Trump disputed Russia\u2019s role, senators from both parties have called for an investigation that will keep making headlines in the new year. The brutal war in Syria is nearing its six-year mark, with no end in sight for the violence that has already killed more than 400,000 people and driven nearly five million from their homes.\u00a0 Several cease-fire deals were made this year, including one agreed to in mid-December just after Syrian government forces claimed the hard-hit city of Aleppo, but in many cases they failed to protect vulnerable civilians. The realities of war were exposed through heartbreaking photos, videos, and even a Twitter account belonging to a 7-year-old girl and her mother. Among the most searing images of the year was one of a 5-year-old boy just after an airstrike, bloodied and ashen-faced with a blank stare in the back of an ambulance. He is just one of many innocent children who have known nothing but war their entire lives. The U.S. election wasn\u2019t the first shocking vote of 2016. In June, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a move nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201d After months of bitter campaigning, the result sent Britain\u2019s prime minister packing and caused economic panic across the globe. The leaders of the \u201cLeave\u201d movement campaigned on the idea that, among other things, the U.K. could have tighter control of its borders without the E.U., while \u201cRemain\u201d supporters mostly argued that leaving would be an economic disaster\u00a0for Britain. Now the country\u2019s new prime minister plans to move forward with Brexit negotiations, and the official break could happen as early as 2019. Mosquitoes were public enemy number one in many parts of the world this year due to their role in spreading the Zika virus.\u00a0 Brazil was the epicenter of the outbreak, where thousands of babies were born with Zika-related microcephaly, or a small head and under-developed brain. That\u2019s just one terrifying result linked to the virus, and it seemed researchers learned more each day throughout the year. The virus has also been linked to\u00a0miscarriages\u00a0and a neurological condition called\u00a0Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which can cause paralysis. Although the World Health Organization said in November the virus is no longer a \u201cglobal health emergency,\u201d\u00a0Zika continues to spread, with locally transmitted cases reported in Florida and Texas for the first time in recent months. President Obama declared a state of emergency in response to the Flint water disaster on January 16, 2016. That was a little less than two years after the local government switched the city\u2019s water source to the Flint River, causing an unprecedented public health crisis\u00a0which officials were slow to recognize. The resulting corrosion of the water pipes meant the residents of Flint, many of them poor and a majority black, were drinking lead-contaminated water day after day. When Obama approved FEMA aid, at least 100 children had already tested with high lead levels in Flint, and many more cases were feared.\u00a0Lead poisoning can permanently and severely affect mental and physical development, according to the Mayo Clinic, and is especially harmful to children and pregnant women. The year was punctuated by horrific attacks like the January siege by\u00a0al Qaeda-linked militants\u00a0on a popular tourist hotel in Burkina Faso, in West Africa, that left nearly 30 people dead, and a deadly bombing at the Brussels airport in Belgium that killed 32 in March. A terror cell involved in 2015\u2019s Paris attack was found to be behind the Brussels plot.\u00a0 Suicide bombers linked to ISIS targeted the Istanbul airport in a similar attack just three months later, killing more than 40. Then in July, an attacker killed 86 people when he drove a large truck through a crowd celebrating France\u2019s Bastille Day in Nice. And in December, at least 12 died when a hijacked truck slammed into a popular Christmas market in Berlin. The suspect, a migrant believed to have ties to ISIS, fled, sparking a manhunt across Europe. In the midst of pride celebrations across the country, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history targeted the very group that should have been celebrating. A lone gunman entered Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, just after last call on Latin night on June 12, 2016. For several hours, he terrorized club-goers as he gunned down 49 of them while holding off police just outside. The attack left the LGBTQ community feeling raw and unsafe in a space that was meant to be their haven.\u00a0 Americans from all walks of life responded by\u00a0donating blood, offering shelter, and providing comfort and support for those devastated by the massacre. 2016 felt especially cruel as the losses of major cultural icons built up in a steady stream throughout the year \u2014 so many that it would be daunting to list them all here.\u00a0 From musical game-changers like David Bowie and Prince, to beloved actors Alan Rickman and Gene Wilder, to The Greatest,\u00a0Muhammad Ali, America seemed to be in a constant state of mourning over our treasured figures.\u00a0 The deaths of political giants like Supreme Court\u00a0Justice Antonin Scalia and former first lady Nancy Reagan left no facet of American culture untouched by a devastating loss this year. Prince\u2019s death was a high-profile chapter in the opioid addiction epidemic plaguing the U.S. that has dramatically increased in recent years. According to the Department of Health and Human services, 78 people die every day in this country from an opioid-related overdose, whether it be prescription drugs or heroin. Several gut-wrenching videos and photos went viral this year of users near death in public places, sometimes with children involved. In March, President Obama called the crisis is as great a threat as terrorism. Two black men were shot and killed by police in two days in early July, and in both cases video of the incidents went viral, escalating tensions between the black community and law enforcement.\u00a0 Alton Sterling was killed in Baton Rouge after an altercation with officers outside of a liquor store, and the very next day Philando Castile was shot 7 times in his car after a Minnesota officer pulled him over for a busted taillight. His girlfriend, who was in the car along with her 4-year-old daughter, broadcast the aftermath on Facebook Live. The raw, emotional content of her video was widely shared on social media as many people questioned how the shooting could have happened. The officer has since been\u00a0charged with manslaughter.\u00a0 The shootings re-ignited a national\u00a0conversation about race, policing, and how to bridge the deep divide often exposed between the two. Just days after the deaths of Sterling and Castile, a sniper angry over their shootings targeted and shot 12 Dallas police officers who were protecting a peaceful protest. Five officers were killed, and the country struggled with grief over such senseless violence.\u00a0 \u201cWe ask police to do too much and we ask too little of ourselves,\u201d President Obama said at the funeral for the Dallas officers, imploring Americans to come together in unity.\u00a0 But just 10 days later, it happened again: an attacker gunned down three officers in Baton Rouge. In both cases, the gunmen were killed by police and were believed to have acted alone. When convicted rapist\u00a0and ex-Stanford swimmer Brock Turner was sentenced to just six months in jail, the nationwide outcry was loud and clear. But it was his victim\u2019s impassioned letter to the court, published in full online, that opened up the conversation on sexual assault and the nature of consent in America, especially on college campuses. Many pointed to Turner\u2019s light sentencing, and the judge\u2019s reasoning that he did not want jail to have a negative impact on Turner\u2019s future, as a reason why victims often are afraid to come forward. The woman\u2019s letter also called out Turner\u2019s lawyers for citing her drinking as part of their defense. Critics say this kind of narrative suggests victims \u201cask for it\u201d or should be held partly responsible when an assault takes place.\u00a0 Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte found himself in hot water after fibbing about being robbed at gunpoint during the 2016 Rio Games. Turned out, he and some younger teammates had actually just been asked to pay for damage they caused while drunk at a gas station. While some people shrugged them off as \u201cdrunk kids\u201d who \u201cmade a mistake,\u201d others pointed to the larger issue of privilege, saying the 32-year-old Lochte felt it was OK to lie on a national stage. His story infuriated Brazil because the country had already gone to great lengths to prove it was prepared to safely host the Olympics, and the unwelcome distraction wasted time and resources. Lochte ultimately bounced back with a spot on ABC\u2019s \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d Meanwhile, U.S. women\u2019s soccer star Hope Solo had her contract terminated after she said her Swedish opponents played like \u201ccowards\u201d in an Olympic match.\u00a0 It   was the year of the underdog in the baseball and basketball worlds. First, the Cleveland Cavaliers came back from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA finals against the Golden State Warriors to win their city\u2019s first professional sports championship in more than 50 years. Even more unbelievable was who they beat \u2014 the Warriors were being lauded as the best team in history after winning a record 73 games in a single season.\u00a0 Then in November, the Chicago Cubs broke a 108-year curse by winning the World Series against the Cleveland Indians in heart-stopping fashion. Their victory in extra innings in Game 7 kept millions of fans on the edge of their seats.\u00a0 It was the first time the Cubs had even made it to the World Series since 1945. Fake news ran rampant on social media throughout the presidential election, and was sometimes even shared by political candidates. But it wasn\u2019t until after the election that Facebook made the decision to crack down on it.\u00a0 Fake news sites often masquerade as legitimate sources, and they target the ultra-conservative and liberal corners of the internet. People tend to read and share stories that confirm their own biases, but don\u2019t always\u00a0fact-check the information.\u00a0 Such stories have already proven to have dangerous consequences in real life. The outlandish\u00a0\u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory\u00a0spread among users on Reddit and ended with a gunman opening fire in a D.C. pizza restaurant.\u00a0 So it should come as no surprise that Oxford Dictionaries named \u201cpost-truth\u201d the word of the year for 2016. It\u2019s defined as \u201ccircumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\u201d Cydney Adams is a senior manager of social media for CBS News.

            "article_content": "Legalization of recreational marijuana\u00a0was on the ballot in five states this Election Day: California, Massachusetts, Maine, Arizona and Nevada. \u00a0 California, Massachusetts, Nevada and Maine voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, giving a huge boost to the campaign to allow pot nationwide. Arizona rejected it. In general, the proposals for recreational pot would treat cannabis similar to alcohol. Consumption would be limited to people 21 or older and forbidden in most public spaces. Pot would be highly regulated and heavily taxed, and some states would let people grow their own.\u00a0  Voters in Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas approved medical marijuana measures. State-by-state polls showed most of the measures with a good chance of prevailing. But staunch opponents that included law enforcement groups and anti-drug crusaders urged the public to reject any changes. They complained that legalization would endanger children and open the door to creation of another huge industry that, like big tobacco, would be devoted to selling Americans an unhealthy drug.  Check back here for live updates on each state with recreational marijuana on the ballot:\u00a0  CALIFORNIA: APPROVED California voters approved a ballot measure Tuesday allowing recreational marijuana in the nation\u2019s most populous state, handing the legalization movement its biggest victory yet.\u00a0 Voters in nine states considered proposals to expand legal access to the drug, which is still forbidden by the federal government.  California was the first state to approve medical marijuana two decades ago. It was among five states weighing whether to permit pot for adults for recreational purposes.\u00a0 California\u2019s vote means recreational cannabis will be legal along the entire West Coast, giving the legalization movement powerful momentum. That could spark similar efforts in other states and put pressure on federal authorities to ease longstanding rules that classify marijuana as a dangerously addictive drug with no medical benefits. MAINE: \u00a0APPROVED\u00a0 The vote was extremely close, but on Thursday the Associated Press reported the Main initiative passed. Both Maine and Massachusetts previously voted to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana and to authorize medical marijuana programs. Initiatives on the ballot in Maine and Massachusetts would regulate and tax marijuana in ways similar to alcohol. But there are differences in the way the two New England states would proceed under the respective measures.  In Maine, recreational marijuana would be regulated by the existing state Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.   \t \t \tMaine would allow people 21 years of age or older to possess up to 2 1/2 ounces of marijuana and cultivate up to six pot plants in their homes. Massachusetts would allow an individual 21 or older to possess 1 ounce of pot outside their home and up to 10 ounces inside their homes, and to cultivate up to six plants for personal use.  Maine\u2019s proposal calls for a flat 10 percent sales tax on retail marijuana. MASSACHUSETTS: APPROVED Voters have approved a ballot measure making Massachusetts the first state in the eastern U.S. to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. In Massachusetts, the licensing authority for recreational marijuana would be a new three-member Cannabis Control Commission, appointed by the state treasurer. The commission would be advised by a Cannabis Advisory Board with 15 members appointed by the governor. The Massachusetts proposal calls for a 3.75 percent surcharge on retail sales of marijuana, on top of the state\u2019s regular 6.25 percent sales tax. Local jurisdictions could also add up a 2 percent tax, creating a combined maximum tax of 12 percent on pot products. ARIZONA: REJECTED\u00a0 Arizona voters have rejected legalized recreational marijuana following a multimillion-dollar campaign to defeat it.  Proposition 205 failed Wednesday after opponents poured millions into fighting recreational pot for adults in the conservative state on the border with Mexico.  The measure drew donations from local businesses and out-of-state magnates such as casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who contributed $500,000.  Supporters of legal pot said it would have eliminated black markets, freed up police and raised money for K-12 schools.  Opponents said legalization would increase drug trafficking because growers in Arizona can sell to states where it\u2019s illegal. They warned of an increase in teen use and deadly car crashes tied to marijuana. NEVADA: APPROVED The marijuana legalization movement scored its biggest victory yet Tuesday as voters in California, Massachusetts and Nevada approved recreational pot, making the drug fully legal in the nation\u2019s most populous state and giving it a toehold in the densely populated Northeast. The law would allow possession and use by adults of up to an ounce of marijuana and impose a 15 percent excise tax on marijuana sales, with revenue earmarked for education. Businesses that have medical marijuana certification would be the first to be eligible for licenses.\u00a0  Proponents said legalizing pot could generate $20 million a year in tax money for Nevada schools.   \t \t \tOpponents, including Republican U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, billionaire casino magnate and newspaper owner Sheldon Adelson and many of the state\u2019s top elected Republicans called legalization a threat to Nevada children.",

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON, CBS HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION: A turbulent year comes to an end with more revelations about Russian efforts to help Donald Trump got elected and a big question mark as to what to do about it.  Before heading off for a Hawaiian Christmas vacation, President Obama publicly acknowledged what U.S. intelligence has been hinting for weeks.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Mr. Obama said that he personally told Mr. Putin to knock it off and vows to retaliate. But the Obama presidency is coming to an end and his successor still won\u2019t accept that Russia is guilty of tampering with U.S. elections. But president-elect Donald Trump is accepting the thanks of those who voted for him.  He finished his thank you tour by paying his respects to supporters in the Deep South.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: They are saying, as president, he shouldn\u2019t be doing rallies. But I think we should, right?  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  TRUMP: We have done everything else the opposite.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Is that any way to run a presidency?  Henry Kissinger thinks maybe so. We will talk to the former secretary of state about how Trump\u2019s unpredictable style could be an asset.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  HENRY KISSINGER, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven\u2019t seen.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Plus, former Obama National Security Adviser Tom Donilon weighs in on the global challenges facing the new president.  And author Graeme Wood discusses new book on ISIS.  Top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway discusses the transition.  And we will have a conversation with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates about Obama\u2019s legacy. It\u2019s all ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  We turn now to the president-elect \u2018s senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, who is in West Palm Beach.  Kellyanne, I understand you just got off the phone with Mr. Trump. Do he have any news that you want to deliver to us?  KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: He did say hello to you, John. And he looks forward to joining you in the future as the president in an interview. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Excellent. We\u2019ll hold him to that commitment. Let me ask you about a theory I\u2019ve gotten from some Republican officials this week. This is their theory. Once Donald Trump clears the electoral college vote on Monday, he\u2019ll drop his skepticism that Russia was involved in hacking the election. What do you make of that theory? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0The entire nonsense about the electors trying to use the Russian hacking issue to change the election result is really unfortunate. I think that actually undermines our democracy more than any other conversation that we\u2019re having right now. We were really struck by what seems to be disagreement and consternation between the President Obama camp and the Hillary Clinton camps this week. \u00a0 You have Josh Earnest doing remarkable things from the podium of the White House press secretary -- basically telling us all what Donald Trump obviously knew when he would have no way of knowing that and it\u2019s frankly disrespectful. And then you have his own president, President Obama in his final press conference refusing to go all the way here and say that Russia had hacked into emails that went ahead and interfered with the election or shifted the election results. President Obama knows how to win the presidency. He did it twice. And he did it with states like Michigan, which he won by 10 points, which we just won. He did it by winning states like Wisconsin, which Hillary Clinton-- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Kellyanne, sorry to interrupt. But just on this question of -- Mr. Trump is still skeptical that the Russians were even involved. Leaving aside the question of whether it affected the election or not, you have the CIA, the FBI, the Director of National Intelligence, now a number of Republicans saying it\u2019s clear that the Russians hacked \u2013 that, just as a basic premise is clear. Mr. Trump since late September has said that he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. He still says that now. What does he know that all those intelligence officers don\u2019t know? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0John, where is the evidence? Why, when CIA officials were invited to a House intelligence briefing last week did they refuse to go? Instead, they\u2019re talking to the media. That undermines our national security, our intelligence operations. Why are they doing that-- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0But does he himself have evidence, Kellyanne, that suggests that this isn\u2019t the case? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0Well, the president-elect receives intelligence briefings that I am not privy to. But let\u2019s focus on the issue at hand, which is if the CIA, if Director Brennan and others at the top are serious about turning over evidence to we, the American people, they should do that. \u00a0 And they should show up when the House Intelligence Committee invites them to brief them. But, you know, that\u2019s a closed door meeting. So it\u2019s not so exciting and tantalizing. Because then you can\u2019t leak it to the media. They should not be leaking to the media. If there\u2019s evidence, let\u2019s see it. \u00a0 I would note that President Obama himself the other day stopped short of saying what many pundits on TV are saying. \u00a0And they would have no idea because I\u2019m fairly sure they don\u2019t get intelligence briefings. I\u2019ll tell you what the unintelligence briefing we all know is. Which is that Hillary Clinton and her team spent $1.2 billion, lost an election they should have won, didn\u2019t see us coming. And they got a lot of help-- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0But-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0--frankly from people in the media who are still trying to fight the last war. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0I guess what I\u2019m-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0The campaign is over. This man is the president. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Absolutely. And much more to the point, he\u2019s going to be the president. So what we\u2019re trying to do is figure out how does the president-elect take in new information that\u2019s interesting, that\u2019s volatile, that\u2019s at the center of national security here. So on the one hand, you have the entire intelligence community that says the Russians were hacking the election -- again, leaving aside the question of whether it had an effect. And then you have the president-elect totally dismissing that. So I wonder does his entire team have the same view that there is no merit to the idea that the Russians were involved? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0But remember, you just said the word election. I have to push back. Because that\u2019s what everybody\u2019s doing. They\u2019re conflating whether Russia hacked into the emails and how it affected the election. Read -- I see in paragraph in every story. I listen to people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about on TV and frankly are never under oath. \u00a0 We\u2019re listening to the White House press secretary himself make these allegations. Hillary Clinton is telling her donors that. And I\u2019ve talked to some of those donors. And they don\u2019t believe it. They were given all those fancy maps and graphics that assured them Hillary Clinton would win in a blowout. \u00a0 They don\u2019t accept it. Look, I also want \u2013 I want to say something else. I listened to Donna Brazile on a different network on this morning. And I very much appreciated the fact she seems to be pushing back against President Obama and this idea that after President Obama, as he clearly stated in his final press conference on Friday, John. \u00a0He said, \u2018I told Vladimir Putin to cut it out, and he did. The hacking stopped.\u2019 It seems like she was in disagreement with that. It seems like people in the Democratic Party wanted the president to go further and want him to go further now. And I guess that\u2019s his right. We\u2019ll see what he does in the next couple of weeks. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0All right. We are not going to get any insight into the president-elect\u2019s thinking here, but let me try this. Did anyone involved \u2013 \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: I gave you plenty. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: -- in the Trump campaign have any contact with Russians trying to meddle with the election? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0Absolutely not. And I discussed that with the president-elect just last night. Those conversations never happened. I hear people saying it like it\u2019s a fact on television. That is just not only inaccurate and false, but it\u2019s dangerous. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Does the president-elect-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0And\u2014and it does undermine our democracy. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Does the president-elect approve of President Obama\u2019s decision to retaliate against the -- Russians for hacking into the election? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0The president-elect respects the ability of President Obama to do what he sees necessary in any different \u2013 any number of different arenas. It does seem to be a political response at this point because it seems like the president is under pressure from Team Hillary, who can\u2019t accept the election results. And I would point out-- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0So -- sorry, Kellyanne. I just wanted-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0-- to you, since I know this is meant to -- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0-- make sure I didn\u2019t misunderstand that. You\u2019re saying the president is retaliating because he\u2019s doing it purely for political and not national security reasons? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0John, what I\u2019m saying is that the president-elect respects the ability of President -- the right of President Obama to do what he wants. He\u2019s the president for the next several weeks. We believe in sanctions that work, not just sanctions for sanctions\u2019 sake. But it\u2019s very clear that President Obama could have, quote, retaliated months ago if they were actually concerned about this and concerned about this, quote, affecting the election. Whatever his motives are, what his action is, we\u2019ll respect it as Americans. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0But you-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0That doesn\u2019t mean that new President Trump will agree with it and continue with it. But I also want your viewers to be\u2014to be reminded of one thing. When it comes to Russia and coziness, let\u2019s not forget it was Hillary Clinton through her craven foundation requests -- Bill Clinton got a million bucks to give a speech in Russia. And then she turned over 20% of US uranium rights. So let\u2019s be honest about who for money, and who for power, and who for access has cozied up to the Russians. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Just so I\u2019m not left with the wrong impression, I -- the impression you\u2019ve left me is that you\u2019re saying that President Obama\u2019s reacting here to the Russians because he\u2019s feeling political pressure. Do I have a misimpression? \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: No, I didn\u2019t say that. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0Okay. I just want to make sure -- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0No, no. What I\u2019m saying is, John, he is under political pressure. Definitely. Because you\u2019ve got people from Team Hillary saying something very different than what President Obama himself is saying -- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0They are disagreeing. And, look, it\u2019s his legacy that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s being questioned here. That\u2019s obvious. \u00a0They\u2019ve lost 1,000 state legislative seats -- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0All right, Kellyanne. We\u2019re going to have to leave it there-- \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0--they\u2019ve lost the Congress -- \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0All right. \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: --many governorships and senators. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0We\u2019ve run out of\u2014we\u2019ve run out of time. \u00a0  KELLYANNE CONWAY: \u00a0Thanks for having me. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: \u00a0All right.  For analysis on the Russian hacking story, as well as the deteriorating situation in Syria, we\u2019re joined by former Obama National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, \u201cWashington Post\u201d columnist David Ignatius, and CBS News foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.  David, I want to start with you.  On the one hand, you have a president who is saying that he is going to retaliate against the Russians. You have this consensus in the intelligence community. The president-elect doesn\u2019t even believe the beginning premise, which is that the Russians were involved.  What do you make of that pretty big gulf?  DAVID IGNATIUS, COLUMNIST, \u201cTHE WASHINGTON POST\u201d: I was struck during Kellyanne\u2019s just now, as I have been by Donald Trump\u2019s comments for weeks and months, by his reluctance to do what typically happens in national security matters, which is seek some kind of bipartisan unified consensus.  The obvious thing for Kellyanne Conway to say and Donald Trump to say is, I want a full congressional investigation by a bipartisan panel so the American people will know the facts.  Instead, I did hear her say that this call for covert retaliation against Russia, which President Obama said we will take action, I heard her say that was a political response.  It\u2019s the opposite of saying we need to come together as a country and be unified.  I just would note one more thing. In this whole crazy story, the one thing that we really do need to know is whether there is any kind of leverage that Russia has over Donald Trump. That\u2019s the question we couldn\u2019t really uncover because we never got the tax returns.  It\u2019s crucial before he takes office, not to attack him, but to liberate him from any pressure. It\u2019s a really important thing. And I hope -- again, there should be bipartisan support for that.  DICKERSON: Tom, the president has said he is going to retaliate against Russia. What are his options?  TOM DONILON, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Well, he has a broad range of options.  But it\u2019s important to kind of lay down some of the predicates here. And I want to get to something that David. As you said, there\u2019s a uniform (INAUDIBLE). The president used that word -- that phrase yesterday with respect to this.  The DNI, the head of the National Security Agency and private sector firms -- I spend a lot of time in this area, right? We just delivered a report to the president on cyber-security. All agree with high confidence that in fact that Russia actually hacked and released this information for an effort to try in some way to effect the election, right?  So, it clearly should be investigated. And the investigation should put forward to the Congress as they prepare to investigate and to the American people what the facts are, get underneath these issues of intent, and to try to come up with ways in which we can facilitate efforts to prevent this from happening in the future.  I think this is, by the way, part of a broader effort by Vladimir Putin, since he came back into office in the spring of 2012, to undermine Western institutions and Western confidence and to split allies.  So, it\u2019s a broader strategic question, I think, that needs to be addressed here. And that includes, I think, shoring up some of these Western institutions. On the responses you asked me about is that he has a (AUDIO GAP) cyber area, but also (AUDIO GAP) cyber area, but (AUDIO GAP).  The United States has an awful lot of leverage in the financial world, for example, and in the monetary world, where it could act. So, I think that he will consider all these. And, again, I think that\u2019s a pretty broad range of responses.  MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: And I thought it was interesting, because while I heard all the same things you did from Kellyanne Conway, she also she, we want sanctions that work.  I\u2019m not sure if she means sanctions in this case or if that was a condemnation of the financial sanctions that the U.S. already has on Russia. But Republicans like Lindsey Graham are for calling in the new Congress for some kind of pressure. And the administration now is looking at tightening some of those sanctions -- or financial punishment, essentially, on senior leaders in the GRU, Russia\u2019s main intelligence arm.  The problem is, that\u2019s punitive. It\u2019s not prohibitive. And that doesn\u2019t in any way really counter the attack on the cyber-front. It\u2019s merely a punishment.  DONILON: There\u2019s support and I think it\u2019s part of this effort to get out with public attribution with as much information as possible.  I think that\u2019s what the president intends to do. The other thing, on David\u2019s point on -- in 2008, President Bush 43 and his chief of staff, Josh Bolten, initiated a process which we found very helpful. And that was this, to bring the outgoing Cabinet members in the national security area and the incoming Cabinet members in the national security area together several time in the Situation Room to go through key issues and establish facts and get a deep understanding of the actions and programs that were under way.  And, again, the incoming administration will agree and disagree in areas. But it was a really, I thought, very helpful exercise that we were a little kind of skeptical of at the beginning. But it turned out during the course of these things that in fact the world looks a lot different when you sit in the Situation Room, right, with your predecessors, right, and go through the facts and get detailed briefings.  I think it\u2019s an exercise that I would certainly recommend that we do in this case.  DICKERSON: Well, this is what I was trying to get at with, how does the new president-elect take in new information that might be inconvenient -- inconvenient in this case because it puts a little cloud over his election victory?  David, speaking of facts and the way politics play a role, the presidential essentially said in his press conference that Republicans are now thinking more warmly about Putin basically because it\u2019s in their rooting interests as Republicans.  What do you make of that assessment? And do you think Republicans are, because Donald Trump has a warmer view of Vladimir Putin, actually shift, or is there -- where do things stand?  IGNATIUS: I think Republicans so mistrust Barack Obama, that if Barack Obama says Putin is terrible, they will be some Republicans who just take the other side.  I thought the most powerful thing that the president said in his farewell news conference was Russian covert actions against us during our election season have been successful to the extent that we\u2019re a divided country.  We are a soft target. We\u2019re the ideal target for this kind of thing because it\u2019s just so easy to push us further apart. The president was pleading almost, as he has now for several years, to come together.  Again, this is the challenge for Donald Trump is to say to the country, we\u2019re too divided. On this issue, we need to come together as we assess Russia\u2019s intents, on every issue.  DICKERSON: Yes.  Margaret, I want to switch to Syria. What did you make of the president? Outgoing (AUDIO GAP) Aleppo now, the rebel stronghold, is a synonym for hell.  What did you make of Barack Obama\u2019s wrestling with that at his press conference?  BRENNAN: His language couldn\u2019t be more different to John Kerry comparing it to the 1995 Srebrenica genocide days before, Kerry using and coming very close to saying, this is out ethnic cleansing.  President Obama said, yes, I do feel some reasonability, as leader of the free world, when I see this kind of mass killing. Particularly, he called out the images of children that deeply trouble him.  But then he also stepped back and said I don\u2019t have blood on my hands. That\u2019s Iran. That\u2019s Russia. That\u2019s the Assad regime. So, he went back to that argument of what his critics call a straw man argument, that short of military invasion and American boots on the ground, there\u2019s simply nothing the United States can do.  The White House is very sensitive on this topic, because keep in mind President Obama\u2019s the very first American president to say prevention of mass atrocities is a national security priority. And he\u2019s seeing that happen.  And what he\u2019s authorized at this point are largely inconsequential diplomatic initiatives backed with no real leverage. Secretary Kerry has even characterized it as weak diplomacy, though it\u2019s continuing to go on.  DICKERSON: All right, Margaret, thanks so much. Thanks to both of you.  And we will be right back in a moment.  Thanks. Few people knows much as about foreign policy, especially as it pertains to Russia, as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. We sat down with him in his office in New York.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: You have President Obama saying that he is going to retaliate in some fashion for this hacking.  President-elect Trump says he\u2019s not even sure the Russians did the hacking. How do you explain that big gap between those two?  KISSINGER: Everybody has the hacking capability.  And probably every intelligence service is hacking in the territory of other countries. But who exactly does what, that would be a very sensitive piece of information. But it\u2019s a very difficult to communicate about it, because nobody wants to admit the scope of what they\u2019re doing.  And I don\u2019t doubt that the Russians are hacking us. And I hope we\u2019re doing some hacking there. Then what use you make, whether it\u2019s a hostile use, that then becomes an international problem.  DICKERSON: You have met with Vladimir Putin a number of times. What do you make of him?  KISSINGER: He\u2019s a character out of Dostoyevsky.  And he is a man with a great sense of connection, inward connection to Russian history as he sees it. And he is a cold calculator of the Russian national interests as he conceives it, and which he believes, probably correctly, has some very unique features.  So, for him, the question of Russian identity is very crucial, because, as a result of the collapse of communism, Russia has lost about 300 years of its history. And so the question of what is Russia looms very large in their mind. And that\u2019s a problem we have never had.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: When we come back, Dr. Kissinger gives us his thoughts on the president-elect. Back in a minute.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: We continue our conversation with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  DICKERSON: What\u2019s your feeling now about president-elect Donald Trump?  KISSINGER: I had not thought of President Trump as a presidential candidate until he became a presidential candidate.  And the first appearances, I thought it was a transitory phenomenon. But I give him huge credit for having analyzed an aspect of the American situation, develop a strategy (AUDIO GAP) against his leadership of his own party and prevailing.  Now his challenge is to apply that same skill to the international situation.  DICKERSON: You told Jeffrey Goldberg of \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d that, with Donald Trump, it could create opportunity, but also serious dislocation.  What\u2019s your assessment now on that?  KISSINGER: Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven\u2019t seen.  So it is a shocking experience to them that he came into office, at the same time, extraordinary opportunity. And I believe he has the possibility of going down in history as a very considerable president, because every country now has two things to consider, one, their perception that the previous president or the outgoing president basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessment of their necessities, and, secondly, that here is a new president who is asking a lot of unfamiliar questions.  And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it. I\u2019m not saying it will. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s an extraordinary opportunity.  DICKERSON: Do you have a sense of what his emerging foreign policy vision is?  KISSINGER: I think he operates by a kind of instinct that is a different form of analysis as my more academic one, that he\u2019s raised a number of issues that I think are important, very important and, if they\u2019re addressed properly, could lead to -- could create results.  DICKERSON: You have advised presidents.  One of the things that voters have said about Donald Trump, since he has no government experience, is that he will be able to surround himself with good advisers. Is that really possible?  KISSINGER: A president has to have some core convictions. He couldn\u2019t get those from advisers.  But he also cannot possibly know everything. It\u2019s in the nature of the presidency that most of the people you meet want something. So, to get objective advice is hard, but that depends very much on the personality of the president.  DICKERSON: What advice would you give incoming President Trump about advisers, about being the president in these times?  KISSINGER: One of the hardest things for the president is to distinguish the routine issues that come through from the essential issues that affect the long term, and not to let himself get sucked into the battles of the bureaucracy for marginal issues, and to keep them focused and to keep his mind clear on what the fundamental things are that he has to accomplish.  DICKERSON: Dr. Kissinger, thank you so much.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Next week, many of you will be celebrating Christmas, instead of watching FACE THE NATION, but we encourage you to set your DVRs.  We will be talking with \u201cThe Late Show\u201d\u2019s Stephen Colbert for a discussion on the year in review. You won\u2019t want to miss it.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Some of our CBS stations are leaving us now, but, for most of you, we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including Graeme Wood\u2019s new book on ISIS, a discussion of President Obama\u2019s legacy with the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, and our political panel.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  President-elect Donald Trump says he\u2019s looking for a simple plan for defeating ISIS within his first 30 days of taking office. But even as ISIS has suffered setbacks in Iraq and Syria, its violent ideology continues to spread. Joining us now is Graeme Wood author of \u201cThe Way of the Strangers: Encounters with the Islamic State.\u201d  Graeme, welcome.  You\u2019ve spent a lot of time with recruiters, sympathizers and -- and supporters of the Islamic State. What -- what have you learned?  GRAEME WOOD, \u201cTHE ATLANTIC\u201d: Well, I\u2019ve discovered that they\u2019re a very diverse group, but they\u2019re unified by a few things. One thing is that they\u2019re idealist. I spent time going to their little club meetings, talking to them over coffee, even playing soccer with them. And I discovered that, first of all, they\u2019re true believers and they have kind of a warped rationality that feeds a belief in a utopian ideal. And that Utopian ideal happens to be a very evil one. They\u2019re -- they\u2019re still dangerous people. But to really understand them, we need to figure out what it means for them to have come to that conclusion.  DICKERSON: What is it like playing -- and you write about this -- but playing soccer, having coffee. By all exterior standards looks like a normal person, and then who has that ideology that you write about that\u2019s so vicious and evil.  WOOD: Yes, I would talk to them and they would say in no uncertain terms that they (INAUDIBLE) my throat to kill, you know, anyone who was -- was standing near us because we were in (INAUDIBLE) Australia, like Norway, like the U.K. And it\u2019s -- it is very (INAUDIBLE) to find that you\u2019re talking to someone who says it\u2019s OK to kill (INAUDIBLE). In the end it was fascinating because these are human beings. They\u2019re people who like to read. They\u2019re very serious about their religion. And they\u2019re very eager, in the case of -- of the people I spoke to, to explain where they got all of that and to tell me what the prophecies said and why I should believe them too.  DICKERSON: And just to make sure nobody gets confused, you\u2019re -- by saying they\u2019re true believers, your view is, when they say this about cutting your throat, they\u2019re not -- it\u2019s not an idle thing.  WOOD: No, the -- they were not kidding around. And one way I can tell that they\u2019re true believers is that in many cases they have acted on it, not necessarily by killing someone, by -- but by, in one case, trying to take a boat to Islamic State territory and now being in jail because of it.  DICKERSON: What\u2019s the biggest misconception people have about the Islamic State?  WOOD: I think people misunderstand about foreign fighters in particular the whole range of -- of motivations and backgrounds that these people come from. They, as I say, are -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re missing something in their live. There is a kind of meaning that they lack. And I think people often think that that meaning or that -- that -- that -- that feeling of lack is because they come from positions of poverty or they -- they feel rejected in their home societies. Often it\u2019s actually because they come from conditions of abundance. They\u2019re -- they\u2019re from rich families in some cases and they find that that is not enough to give them meaning. They\u2019re looking for something (INAUDIBLE) but wealth (INAUDIBLE) that (INAUDIBLE) search of that -- that terrible goal.  DICKERSON: How does a (INAUDIBLE) figure out how to combat that ideology? There\u2019s the battlefield, but then there\u2019s the ideology. So is there a lesson in how to combat it based on what you\u2019ve found?  WOOD: I think there\u2019s some important things that say the president-elect would have to know. I mean he\u2019s said that radical Islam is one of the targets of his foreign policy. And I guess the next step -- step is to find out, what are the differences within Islam, within radical Islam in particular, that motivate people to -- to do one thing or another, and then to understand that this is a pathology within the hearts and souls of individual people who are Americans, who are British, who are Australian, who are Egyptian, and it\u2019s not going to be a problem that is solvable by just going to Syria and stopping what\u2019s happening there. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a problem within people\u2019s souls and that makes it much more difficult to solve.  DICKERSON: Yes, Dr. Kissinger, in an interview he did with Jeffery Goldberg of \u201cThe Atlantic,\u201d said that he thought the (INAUDIBLE) might challenge the new president and hope for an overreaction. What do you think of that theory?  WOOD: I think the -- the idea that -- that overreaction is their goal is -- is absolutely (INAUDIBLE). (INAUDIBLE) operating at 100 percent right now. If they can act, they will. They -- they tell people, don\u2019t delay, just attack as it is, right now, wherever you are.  I also think that it\u2019s important to realize that -- that when they attack, it might not necessarily be a challenge within the borders of the United States. There are allies that -- that Donald Trump has said he\u2019s looking forward to working with, like Sisi of Egypt, for example, who have an ISIS insurgency within their own border -- borders. And overreaction can come also in -- in Egypt, not just through policies of Trump administration.  DICKERSON: And what\u2019s the benefit of overreaction for ISIS?  WOOD: ISIS has been saying about the Trump presidency in particular, that it demonstrates that Muslims cannot have a -- a home in the west. They must move to an Islamic country. So if they can see anything that they -- they can milk for propaganda purposes that shows that that\u2019s the case, then they will absolutely feature that front and center.  DICKERSON: Speaking of which, 30 seconds left. Michael Flynn, who\u2019s the incoming national security adviser, told Al Jazeera in 2015, \u201cwhen you drop a bomb from a drone, you are going to cause more damage than you are going to (INAUDIBLE) good.\u201d Is that in the same category of propaganda victory?  WOOD: I think it depends on where that bomb\u2019s being dropped and -- and who\u2019s the target of it. There are some people for whom there is no solution other than dropping a bomb on them, but it is an ideology that people share and that my book shows exists in countries around the world, in the hearts of people, and drones obviously aren\u2019t going to solve that.  DICKERSON: All right, Graeme Wood, thank you so much.  We\u2019ll be right back with a look at President Obama\u2019s legacy. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: On Friday, President Obama gave what could be his last full news conference. He reflected a bit on his time in office.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I always feel responsible. I felt responsible (INAUDIBLE) snipers. I felt responsible when millions of (INAUDIBLE) displaced. There are places ((INAUDIBLE) happening and because of my office.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: (INAUDIBLE) confidence is that we\u2019ve done what works. That I can prove I can show you (INAUDIBLE) show you were we are now and you can\u2019t argue that we\u2019re not better off.\u201d  I\u2019m here with Ta-Nehisi Coates, who has a piece in \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d for next month and it\u2019s called \u201cMy President was Black.\u201d  In that press conference, President Obama seemed to be saying here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. Does he face a different standard as an African-American president or, we\u2019re in politics, every president\u2019s going to try and defend their legacy.  TA-NEHISI COATES, \u201cTHE ATLANTIC\u201d: Yes. I mean, at this point, no, I don\u2019t think so, because we\u2019re into this, you know, lame duck period. I would say certainly through his eight years, yes, he did. You know, and I think he was very aware of that. I think the people around him were very much aware of that. I think if you look at the way in which, you know, he went about his campaign, he\u2019s very, very conscious of it. But I think he was also uniquely situated for that stand in a way that maybe someone else might -- might not (INAUDIBLE).  DICKERSON: You said he walked (INAUDIBLE).  COATES: (INAUDIBLE).  DICKERSON: (INAUDIBLE) Well, but you put it in this context, right?  COATES: I did. I did. I did.  DICKERSON: That\u2019s part of what writing is.  COATES: I did. I did. You know, what I -- you know, I thought like the whole challenge of governing a country, you know, with a -- a majority white population, and thus, you know, being, you know, the representative of that population. And at the same time having roots in a community which, you know, to put it mildly, you know, (INAUDIBLE) long periods of its history had not been a beneficiary the policy of the country, that\u2019s a very, very, very difficult spot to be in, to be with and to be without, you know, at -- at the same time. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve appreciated how difficult that actually was. I think, as historians go back over this period, they\u2019ll really, you know, begin to see it  DICKERSON: And you carefully trace his unique place within that community that you\u2019re talking about. You said that he said something to the country -- \u201csomething which no black person can but every president must, I believe you.\u201d What gave him the ability to say that?  COATES: Oh, the president is unique, right? And the president isn\u2019t just unique because he\u2019s biracial, because his mom was white and his dad was -- was black. It\u2019s the fact that you had that combination, but he grew up far from the fulcrum of Jim Crow in Hawaii. And on top of that, he had a deeply, deeply loving family of -- of what people, primarily. His mom and his grandparents, who saw no conflict between that love and affirming the fact that -- that he was black. You know, he told me when I was interviewing him that his mom thought black people, you know, were cool. You can sort of, you know, grimace at that or laugh at that, but it\u2019s much better than the alternatives, which many people, you know, who are the result of biracial unions during the time the president was born would have faced in this country. So what he had was a community of white people who were very, very close to him who loved him. As you know as I, you know, said in the piece, he saw the best of white American in the most intimate way possible and thus was able to communicate a kind of trust that, you know, honestly I think African-Americans who we raised, for instance, how I was. And as he said, even as his wife was. You know, have a much more difficultly demonstrating it (ph).  DICKERSON: You have covered him over eight years. He also wrote about this topic himself in his own book. What\u2019s your sense of his arc, of his evolution on this question, that, I mean, he wrote a whole book that was praised before he was ever a politician.  COATES: Right.  DICKERSON: What\u2019s your sense of how he\u2019s -- if he were to write that book about his eight years, what would the journey be that he sketched a similar journey in his own book?  COATES: You know, John, I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s changed. That\u2019s the -- (INAUDIBLE) this is the first time when you -- when you\u2019ve raised that, that I\u2019ve thought about it, but I think, you know, the book is optimistic. The book does have this kind of, you know, measured tone that the president, you know, always takes. You know (INAUDIBLE) in a divisive sort of way, but it\u2019s not a particularly strident, you know, book. And so I don\u2019t -- you know, I think he is who he is. You know, I don\u2019t know that -- that he\u2019s changed much since that time. He did say to me, you know, that he was shocked by the kind of political opposition that he immediately faced when he came, you know, into power, but did that alter any of his basic sense of American institutions or, you know, the American people? I don\u2019t think it did.  DICKERSON: Well, I was struck in his press conference that he ended on hope.  COATES: Yes.  DICKERSON: That he went back to saying, it was what I spoke about in that 2004 speech.  COATES: That\u2019s right.  DICKERSON: What -- and so you have the president saying that and then you have Michelle Obama saying we\u2019re now -- in an interview with Oprah, we\u2019re now feeling what it feels like -- what not having hope feels like.  Hope was at the center of his campaign. What do you -- how do you -- how do you -- what do you make of all of that and this -- and this question of hope that he\u2019s still (ph) hopeful. Is that a -- necessary for politics? Is it a --  COATES: Yes, I think it was necessary for him. And just to, you know, break this up a little bit. I think like the point you just made go back to the question you asked me before about what was different and unique. I don\u2019t know, for instance, the president would say, as the first lady said, that we\u2019re now feeling what it is to be like without -- notice the different, you know, spin, you know, on that.  But it also could be that, as president, like, as a believer of American institutions, (INAUDIBLE) role to speak in that -- in that sort of fashion. So I think part of it is, there\u2019s something within him that angles him in that, you know, deeply optimistic way. But at the same time, he also believes that\u2019s what the role requires, so it\u2019s not, you know, much of an act for him either.  DICKERSON: Does he -- why do you think he wanted to talk to you at such length? You have written about this --  COATES: (INAUDIBLE) --  DICKERSON: Well, to be fair, you\u2019ve written about --  COATES: No, I\u2019m serious. This is not false modesty, John.  DICKERSON: No, I know. I understand. But -- but did he -- does he feel like he\u2019s been misunderstood in the African-American community and was he trying to make a case or --  COATES: See that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the hard thing about (INAUDIBLE). No, I mean if you said like obviously I\u2019ve written some (INAUDIBLE) president, right? And if you took the president\u2019s position, and I\u2019ve never been in -- under illusion about it(ph). If you took the president\u2019s position and my positions, you know, and you polled the African-American community, I think it would come out about 80/20 in his favor. He\u2019s hugely popular among, you know, black folks. So why -- certainly in talking to me, he didn\u2019t need me to interpret him.  DICKERSON: Yes.  COATES: You know, for African-Americans (ph) rub off on me. So it wasn\u2019t that. To be honest with you, I mean the whole time I was going through it, I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know, because he could have picked somebody who\u2019s more in agreement with him. And to be honest with you, I think there were people on his team who felt that way, you know.  DICKERSON: But isn\u2019t that why he picked you, because you weren\u2019t in -- in agreement with him and you\u2019ve been reporting this issue, not just thinking about, but reporting it out. So tell me what your reporting -- where did you start when this -- these conversation start --  COATES: Yes.  DICKERSON: And was it the same place where you ended up? And, if not, what did you discover along the way?  COATES: Well, I was always amazed, you know what I mean? I was always deeply impressed with the president, even when -- even when I was critical of him. You know, as an intellect, as -- as a person. You know, as a piece I -- you know, a piece I wrote in 2012, you know, he was the first -- not just the first African-American president, but the first president who could credibly teach a course in an African- American studies department. I mean his knowledge of -- of race was just that, you know, thorough and that complete. And in addition to that, as I, you know, write in the piece, I saw in several off the record conversations, you know, he has just a deeply curious and active mind. It\u2019s something that, you know, see -- see it at work.  It was difficult to tell when you\u2019re writing from a distance, which (INAUDIBLE) myself until recently, is whether this is sincere or whether it\u2019s an act. (INAUDIBLE) you know, still maintaining, you know, the critiques I\u2019ve had and I\u2019ve (INAUDIBLE). It\u2019s deeply sincere. Its -- it is -- you know, he -- he is (INAUDIBLE). (INAUDIBLE) had to come to, I guess, appreciate that someone with my particular (INAUDIBLE), my particular critique of this country would probably not be president. And I don\u2019t even mean me. I mean like somebody with -- with that, you know, angle. So it left you with this deep question, do you want an African-American president or not? What does that actually mean because it\u2019s not going to be on your political terms. So what\u2019s the worth of it, you know?  DICKERSON: All right, Ta-Nehisi Coates, thanks so much for being here.  COATES: Thank you so much for having me, John.  DICKERSON: It\u2019s a really interesting piece. We appreciate it.  And we\u2019ll be right back with our panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Ron Brownstein.  Susan, I want to start with you.  Russia, election, Donald Trump. Kellyanne Conway seems to still be defending the position that Ronald -- that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t believe Russia was involved at all. Where do you -- what do you make of this story?  SUSAN PAGE, \u201cUSA TODAY\u201d: You know, I think that -- that the president-elect seems to be taking the attitude that this is an assault on his legitimacy (INAUDIBLE) election (ph) and is pushing back hard on that. Now, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question he\u2019s going to be -- win the Electoral College tomorrow and is going to be inaugurated as president on -- on January 20th, but that\u2019s the only reason I can think of for him to take such a stance that is at odds with the universal conclusions of our intelligence agencies that we\u2019re hearing that Russia did hack with the idea of affecting our election. Not every single agency or maybe not every single official, I think, endorses the idea this was Donald Trump (INAUDIBLE), although there is an emerging consensus among intelligence agencies that that was the case.  DICKERSON: Ron.  RON BROWNSTEIN, ATLANTIC MEDIA: There is another reason. I mean the other reason is that he wants to reset relations with Russia. And this -- acknowledging this, which -- which, you know, becomes more and more difficult not to acknowledge it, and Kelly Anne Conway was remarkable in -- at one point insinuated that the president was not acknowledging the Russia actually engineered the hack, which is not true. You know, it does make it tougher for him to move policy, I think, in the direction that he wants to move. And I think there\u2019s an enormous incentive -- you know, President Obama has taken the high road (INAUDIBLE), and as Donald Trump, avoided personally criticizing each other. But there\u2019s enormous incentive for President Obama to put out as much information as he can and also perhaps to act before Inauguration Day to kind of create facts on the ground that the next president will have to deal with.  DICKERSON: It was -- and I couldn\u2019t quite make sense of her answer, which at one point said Barack Obama was responding against Russia for political pressure, but then -- then seemed to suggest that she wasn\u2019t. Ron, do you think that after the electoral vote on Monday, Donald Trump -- either Monday night or Tuesday morning -- will send a tweet out saying, the Russians hacked?  BROWNSTEIN: I don\u2019t know. I mean I think -- look, I think, you know, there has been very -- there\u2019s been less difference between Donald Trump candidate and Donald Trump president-elect than you might have expected. I mean the -- the thank you tour. I mean watching that yesterday, the themes of that were so strikingly similar to him as candidate, still aimed at that 46 percent that elected him. If you look at the polling that we\u2019ve had, you know, a variety of polls, Pew, Gallop, NBC/\u201dWall Street Journal,\u201d essentially he is -- you know, he is in good stead with the people who voted for him. He is not getting the honeymoon beyond that that is often the case for -- for an incoming president. He\u2019s still talking to his electorate. You would think that, yes, he would do that because it is an unequivocal conclusion of the intelligence community and at some point it behooves you to acknowledge reality, but I wouldn\u2019t guarantee it.  DICKERSON: Susan, in our poll, six in ten said they weren\u2019t proud of the president, which is another way of talking about the other portion of the county that didn\u2019t vote for him and that is in the hard core camp. He really hasn\u2019t done anything (INAUDIBLE) he\u2019s done the victory tour. He took -- he\u2019s done a lot of (INAUDIBLE) really much to get at that unity that he says that he wants in the country.  PAGE: This is the other thing that I think for the Trump people they really bristle at, the fact that a majority of Americans did not vote for him for president. The fact that Hillary Clinton won a clear victory in the popular vote, although that\u2019s not what counts when it comes to being elected president and this failure to use this period -- this is the best period he could have that\u2019s under his own control to reach out to people who didn\u2019t support him. (INAUDIBLE) that very disputed election the first Gallup poll after George W. Bush was clearly going to be the new president, 65 percent approval, 26 percent disapproval for George W. Bush.  DICKERSON: Yes.  PAGE: You look at it now, it\u2019s 48 percent -- 48 percent. He hasn\u2019t expanded his support among Americans who are inclined, I think as a people to say, he\u2019s won the election, we need to give him a chance. He\u2019s not benefitting from that. And part of it is because he\u2019s doing things like this victory tour that is designed really to rally his own troops.  BROWNSTEIN: Susan, do you remember the first speech after the Supreme Court ended the vote count in 2000. George Bush -- George W. Bush spoke from the well of the Texas state legislature talking about how he had worked with Democrats and Pete Laney (ph), the House speaker. It\u2019s a very different message. And, you know, if you look at the -- look at the cabinet appointees of Donald Trump. They are about unifying the Republican coalition. And while our focus has entirely been on these foreign conflicts with Russia and China during the transition, you look at the nature of these appointees, whether it\u2019s the OMB or EPA or education or energy, we\u2019re going to have plenty of domestic conflict immediately after January -- you know, after he takes office because they point toward a very aggressive move to not only undo much of President Obama\u2019s agenda, but to make fundamental, structural changes in many of the domestic programs that were not, I think, at the foreground of the presidential election.  DICKERSON: Let\u2019s turn for a moment to the president -- President Obama\u2019s press conference, Susan. What did you make of it? He\u2019s still trying to create space and room and give the guy a chance almost to President-elect Trump.  PAGE: Here\u2019s a critical question, what role is President Obama going to take after January 20th?  DICKERSON: Right.  PAGE: Is he going to lead the opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to dismantle parts of his legacy, or is he going to step back, which is what modern presidents have generally done? And I think that\u2019s a hard question to -- to answer at this point.  One thing that struck me about his news conference was how defensive he was. Defensive on whether he should have done more to publicize and push back on Russia hacks before the election too place, defensive, as you discussed in an earlier panel, on whether he should have done more on Syria and very much in his opening statement making the case, I\u2019m leaving the country in better shape than when I found it when I was inaugurated, trying to make the case, I think implicitly against Donald Trump\u2019s argument that everything is terrible and needs to be shaken up.  DICKERSON: That\u2019s right. So will he be Hoover with FDR or George W. Bush with Barack Obama, being silent, basically, about Barack Obama?  Ron, what did you make of the -- of the press conference? He also talked about the Democratic Party and what it needed to do.  BROWNSTEIN: Yes. First of all, I feel that consistently during the transition he is both taking the high road and giving Donald Trump a chance, but also laying the predicate to be more critical and active after -- by being able to say, look, I gave him every chance. And he has said over and over again that, you know, maybe it will look different when you\u2019re president, and I think that gives him a little more leeway to say, you know, maybe -- if it doesn\u2019t look different, that there\u2019s a reason. And, don\u2019t forget, when he was in Lima, Peru, he did not rule out the possibility of being more -- at the APAC, of being more visible.  Look, his -- look, the Democratic Party faces, you know, an enormous challenge. I mean they have won the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections. No party in American history has ever done (INAUDIBLE). (INAUDIBLE) a coalition that in some ways is a majority of the national level, but it is not distributed in a way that allows them to easily control Congress, first of all, and now also to win the Electoral College. Donald Trump won the Electoral College fair and square. Democrats have to figure out whether they can find a way to talk to more non-college, non-urban voters, which is where they lost this election, or is their future more in moving further in kind of turning out this new coalition they have, which is diverse, younger, more white-collar and more urban. In politics the answer is usually some of both, but I\u2019ve got to think there\u2019s going to be a lot of Democrats looking at figures, if not literally, like Joe Biden, who can talk to voters beyond the circle where they are doing so well.  DICKERSON: Joe Biden from Scranton, P.A.  Susan, I want to ask you about Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate. Politico had a story this week saying, on some things like infrastructure spending, Schumer\u2019s closer to Donald Trump than Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, is. What\u2019s Schumer\u2019s role in life going forward?  PAGE: You know, I think Schumer\u2019s role is to align with Donald Trump on stuff like infrastructure that he might agree with and which, by the way, has the subsidiary effect of diving Republicans. I think he likes that. But he is also clearly the leader of the opposition. Democrats are divided. They need to decide who they are. They need to develop a new generation of leaders. But their -- their clear leader at this point is Chuck Schumer, who has the only piece of real leverage they have against the president and the Republican Congress, and that is the Senate filibuster.  DICKERSON: All right, Susan Page, Ron Brownstein, thanks to both of you so much.  BROWNSTEIN: Thank you.  DICKERSON: And we\u2019ll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: That\u2019s it for us today. Thanks for watching. Next week we\u2019ll be here with Stephen Colbert and our annual CBS News correspondent\u2019s roundtable. Set your DVR if you\u2019re going to be at church or ripping open those presents when we\u2019re on the air.  For FACE THE NATION, I\u2019m John Dickerson.      (o\ufffdx\ufffd\u0694",

            "article_content": "by Stanley Feldman and Melissa Herrmann Many observers thought this presidential election would be decided by Donald Trump\u2019s polarizing rhetoric, his history of behavior toward women and his questionable qualifications for the office. Instead, CBS News exit polls suggest Trump\u2019s win was in large part a repudiation of Hillary Clinton by a substantial number of white voters. While Clinton did win big majorities of minority voters, she did not get the level of support from those groups that she needed to overcome her deficit among white voters.  There are also indications that Clinton\u2019s gender was a factor in the outcome. The gender gap was substantial. Trump beat Clinton by 53 percent to 41 percent among men while Clinton won among women by 54 percent to 42 percent. Four years ago, President Obama won 45 percent of men\u2019s votes and Mitt Romney won 44 percent of women\u2019s votes. More telling is the gender breakdown among white voters: Trump beat Clinton among white women 53 percent to 43 percent. This was close to Romney\u2019s margin in 2012. While Mr. Obama won 35 percent of white, male voters in 2012, Clinton lost to Trump among this group by 63 percent to 31 percent. \u00a0 As expected, Trump did best among white voters without a college degree, beating Clinton by the enormous margin of 72 percent to 23 percent. Trump also won among white, non-college women 62 to 34 percent and white college-educated men, 54 to 39 percent. Among white voters, Clinton only won among women with a college degree by a 51 to 45 percent margin. Interestingly, among white voters, there is no evidence in the exit poll that income affected the likelihood that they supported Trump.  Clinton needed extremely strong support from African-American voters to try to offset Trump\u2019s margin among whites. She did win 88 percent of the black vote to just 8 percent for Trump. However, this was significantly lower than the 93 percent of black voters Mr. Obama won four years ago. The falloff in her share of the black vote was entirely due to black men. Clinton won among black women by a 93 percent to 4 percent margin. Among black men she won by 80 percent to 13 percent.  Many political observers thought a significant number of Republicans would either vote for Clinton, one of the third party candidates, or stay home rather than casting their votes for Trump. According to the exit polls, Republicans stayed loyal to their presidential candidate. Some 89 percent of self-described Republicans voted for Trump; 91 percent of white Republicans did. In contrast, only 84 percent of white Democrats voted for Clinton. She did win 86 percent of white Democratic women, but only 81 percent of white, Democratic men voted for her. Surprisingly, given all of the attention to Trump\u2019s attitudes and behavior toward women, he did virtually as well among white, Republican women (91 percent support) as he did among white, Republican men (92 percent). Clinton was more competitive among white independent women than men, losing to Trump by a 49 to 41 percent margin among independent women and by 57 to 31 percent among independent men. These were not likable candidates who instilled a great deal of confidence in their supporters. Many voters supported one of these candidates despite significant misgivings. The majority of voters had unfavorable impressions of both. Twelve percent of Clinton voters and 20 percent of Trump voters had an unfavorable opinion of the candidate for whom they opted. So despite their misgivings about the candidates, something still compelled them to support one of them. Both candidates were seen as not being honest or trustworthy by more than 6 out of 10 voters. However, among white voters, 57 percent said Trump was not honest and trustworthy while fully 70 percent said the same of Clinton. Almost 3 in 10 white voters said neither candidate was honest and trustworthy. Among this group, Trump won 52 percent to Clinton\u2019s 32 percent. 13 percent of these voters supported one of the third party candidates.  Voters in the exit polls were asked if each of the candidates was qualified to serve as president. Almost half thought Clinton was not qualified but only 5 percent of her voters thought that. Even more voters, 6 out of 10, thought Trump was not qualified to be president. Almost a quarter of Trump voters gave him their support despite saying he was not qualified.\u00a0  Voters were also asked whether each candidate has the temperament to serve effectively as president. By a slim margin, 55 percent to 43 percent, voters said Clinton did have the right temperament. Sixty-three percent said Trump did not have the temperament to be president. Just over half of all white voters said both candidates did not have the right temperament. While very few of Clinton\u2019s voters questioned her temperament, 1 in 4 Trump voters backed him while saying he did not have the temperament to be president.  Voters were asked how they would feel if Clinton were elected president and 53 percent said they would be concerned or scared. Similarly, if Trump were elected president, 58 percent said they would be concerned or scared. Among Clinton voters, 10 percent would be concerned or scared if Clinton were elected and 95 percent would be concerned scared about a Trump presidency. Interestingly, while 94 percent of Trump voters would be concerned or scared about Clinton being elected, 17 percent said they would be concerned about a President Trump.  If many people had serious doubts about both candidates, is there a way to determine how they distinguished between Clinton and Trump? In the exit polls, voters were asked whether they strongly favored their candidate, liked their candidate but with reservations, or if they voted because they disliked the other candidate. While 21 percent of Clinton voters said they disliked the other candidates, more \u2013 28 percent \u2013 of Trump voters reported that. There appears to have been more people voting against Clinton than against Trump.  Can we say Trump did better than expected in the election because a majority of voters supported his most powerfully articulated policy positions? Exit poll voters were asked whether most illegal immigrants working in the U.S. should be offered a chance to apply for legal status or deported to the country they came from. Fully 7 of 10 voters said they should be allowed to apply for legal status. Similarly, more people opposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico than supported it. And virtually as many voters (38 percent) said trade with other countries creates more U.S. jobs as said it takes away jobs (42 percent).  How did Trump win when many of his core positions were so unpopular? Some people voted for him regardless of that. Among those who favored giving illegal immigrants a chance to apply for legal status, one in three voted for Trump. Thirty-five percent of people who said international trade creates jobs voted for Trump. And even 27 percent of white voters who said they want the next president to change to more liberal policies voted for Trump.  One issue that may have motivated some white voters is the ongoing national debate over the way police treat African-Americans. The exit poll asked voters whether they think the country\u2019s criminal justice system treats all people fairly or treats blacks unfairly. Half of white voters said blacks are treated fairly while 41 percent say they are treated unfairly. Among the first group, 8 in 10 voted for Trump. Sixty-five percent who said blacks are treated unfairly voted for Clinton.  With so many tightly contested races, the votes cast for candidates such as Gary Johnson and Jill Stein may have impacted the overall results. The exit polling asked voters they would have cast ballots for if there were only two candidates (Clinton and Trump). A quarter of Johnson voters said Clinton, 15 percent said Trump, and 55 percent said they would not have voted. Numbers were similar for Stein voters, with about a quarter saying they would have chosen Clinton, 14 percent saying Trump, and 61 percent saying they would not have voted. It is difficult to say with any certainty, but with razor thin margins in some states, a small number of voters who might have supported Clinton could have altered outcomes in some states.  -------------\u00a0 Stanley Feldman is professor of political science at Stony Brook University; Melissa Herrmann is president of SSRS",

            "article_content": "In their harrowing new Netflix documentary, \u201cThe Ivory Game,\u201d Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani make the case for staving off the extinction of African elephants.\u00a0 The film -- executive produced by Leonardo DiCaprio -- follows the government officials, journalists and activists looking to stop the poaching and halt the illegal ivory trade that perpetuates it. But it\u2019s an uphill battle. CBS News sat down with the filmmakers at the Toronto International Film Festival to learn more.\u00a0 With a film like this, how do you achieve the sense of urgency necessary in getting your point across? Davidson: Numbers float depending on who you talk to, but we happened to be partnered with Vulcan Productions, and Paul Allen has the great elephant census, so we\u2019ve been going with numbers that have been talked about a lot, but we feel like now that new numbers have been released -- they\u2019re actually a bit worse than we thought. Ladkani: Oh yeah, they were much worse. And what we also realized was that just during the three years we were making our film, 100,000 elephants were killed, so time was of the essence for us to get this out as fast as possible.\u00a0 Davidson: I think most filmmakers generally want a slow roll-out. They want their film to have a long life from the time you get the festival [premiere] to the time you wind up on, say, a platform like Netflix. But for us it was the complete opposite. So we sold the film to Netflix five months prior to Toronto, which has sped up the release of this. Because it really is crucial. We\u2019re at a point right now where if you wait a year, that\u2019s 30,000 to 40,000 more elephants. They can\u2019t wait for our release schedule. One of the points made in the film is that taking guns away from poachers is more important than arresting them. Davidson: It\u2019s more about prevention. It\u2019s great when you catch the guy after the fact, but the elephant\u2019s still been killed. The whole strategy is follow the gun trail, and that\u2019s what they do -- follow the guns and get to the criminals before they get to the elephants, take the guns off the market and save the elephant before it happens. How much has this look at the ivory industry changed your perceptions of signifiers of wealth? Davidson: Probably the most shocking thing that I didn\u2019t know was really just how much this stuff was going for -- $300,000 for a [carved] tusk. Then you really look at it and you think about what this actually is that you\u2019re looking at and it\u2019s horrifying. To know this is going for this much money and it\u2019s going to a very small, elite sector of people of wealth in China is sobering.\u00a0 You\u2019ve both covered other important issues in your work. When you\u2019re doing a film about a certain subject how do you deal with the initial resistance of, \u201cWhy this cause instead of something else?\u201d Ladkani: This one was kind of an obvious one because as soon as I read that elephants are going extinct because of greed and money and that there are giant syndicates involved that are also trafficking drugs and weapons, I was like, \u201cThat is a huge story and completely unheard of and it was something that needs to get out there.\u201d Of course, there are so many other animals at risk -- the tiger, the lion, the rhino for sure -- but you do have to try to make a point with one of them and it has an effect on all the others.\u00a0 Davidson: On the same note, neither of us are pure activist filmmakers. There\u2019s a strong activism component to this, but we\u2019re also filmmakers -- meaning that we have to tell a story that\u2019s compelling and watchable. I\u2019m not going to use the word \u201cenjoyable\u201d because it\u2019s hard to put that word together with this, but it has to have a strong narrative flow. And this is a very, very complex movie. This is an international movie, there are a lot of characters. So it\u2019s a pretty epic, global film when you look at it. We\u2019re all over the world on this thing.  With the release coming up, what\u2019s your hope as far as a response? Ladkani: We have a website, which is not just about the content of the film but the whole behind-the-scenes and the people behind it and their organizations and what they do. We explain options for solutions, so we want people to get behind it, become active and then we want this to multiply so it reaches politicians so they start talking about it. Hopefully, post-presidential election we have the right president that will care. Hillary Clinton would care, we know that. She has been supporting the global fund.  Davidson: You have less to worry about, you live in Munich. Ladkani: No, no, but Europe is a disaster. Only France is banning the trade. All of the others still allow the trade -- like within the country, not cross-border trade. International trade is banned worldwide, but they still keep it alive and they don\u2019t want to ban it, and that\u2019s wrong and that\u2019s sending the wrong message.  Davidson: I think if at the end of the day people watch the film and all people say is, \u201cOh that\u2019s terrible, I feel so hopeless, there\u2019s nothing I can do\u201d then ... Ladkani: We failed. Davidson: We failed miserably. But I\u2019m confident they will say, \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d \u201cThe Ivory Game\u201d is available to stream worldwide on Netflix.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump was effusive in praising United Technologies (UTX) on Thursday for agreeing to keep jobs at its Carrier subsidiary from leaving Indiana for Mexico, saying that the company had \u201cstepped up.\u201d But another factor may have been at work: an implicit threat to yank lucrative federal contracts from the defense conglomerate if it ignored the president-elect\u2019s pleas. Certainly, the math involved in the deal suggests the considerable pressure on United technologies to comply. After all, by agreeing to Trump\u2019s demand that it curb plans to abandon Indianapolis, Carrier is losing more money than it would gain by going south of the border. \u00a0 Carrier has contended that a $7 million tax break from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-public organization, was what made it change its mind about moving all its Indianapolis jobs to Mexico. The deal was brokered by President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is Indiana\u2019s governor and chairs the economic development group.\u00a0 But the company also has said that it would save $65 million per year by shuttering the plant, which makes furnaces, and axing all its 1,400 jobs. Instead, Carrier will now keep the facility open and 1,000 positions in place, with the rest going to Mexico.\u00a0 Notably, however, the $7 million tax break is spread over 10 years. That amounts to $700,000 annually, a fraction of the savings Carrier would glean from transferring all Indianapolis operations to Mexico. In addition, as part of the deal, the company committed to spending an additional $16 million to maintain its operations in Indiana. To former Indiana Lt. Gov. John Mutz, a Republican who serves on the economic development body\u2019s board, a significant factor in Carrier\u2019s reversal was the parent company\u2019s fear of seeing its federal contracts put at risk.\u00a0 \u201cThe dynamics are considerably different than they were even before the election,\u201d Mutz told the Indianapolis Business Journal. \u201cYou\u2019re talking here about a company that is trying to be competitive and also wants to keep their business with the government.\u201d\u00a0 Appearing at the Carrier plant Thursday, Trump told workers that companies would not be able to \u201cleave the United States anymore without consequences.\u201d He added that they would be \u201ctaxed heavily at the border\u201d if they tried, although it wasn\u2019t clear what he meant exactly. Trump said he had called United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes personally to get him to change his mind about shuttering the Indianapolis plant.\u00a0 United Technologies, Carrier\u2019s parent, is the nation\u2019s eighth-largest federal contractor, garnering $6.7 billion from Washington in 2015, which is about 10 percent of its total revenue. Much of that government money is in defense work, such as making engines for F-35 fighter jets.\u00a0 Carrier didn\u2019t say much about its decision-making process to stay put in Indiana, other than that the tax break was a significant influence. \u201cThe incentives offered by the state were an important consideration\u201d in the company\u2019s doing its about-face, the company said in a\u00a0statement. Requests for further comment were not answered.\u00a0 When a journalist asked if the company\u2019s shift was related to maintaining good relations with the new administration, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the deal \u201cis about keeping American jobs within America.\u201d \u201cThis is about the president-elect and vice-president-elect making good on their promise to go to bat for American workers, which they\u2019re doing, even before they\u2019re actually sworn in,\u201d Miller told reporters in a call. The jobs saved in Indiana, though, are a pittance compared with the estimated 300,000 jobs that on average are shipped yearly from the U.S. to other nations, where the wages usually are far lower. And some wonder whether Trump\u2019s ad-hoc interventions will be enough to stem the tide.\u00a0 \u201cJust lurching from deal to deal will not be enough,\u201d the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. a pro-business think tank, said in a statement, calling for a more thorough strategy to retain high-value jobs on American shores.\u00a0 The reason for the continued allure of shipping American jobs to foreign countries is the stark difference in costs. The average pay in Monterrey, the Mexican city where Carrier planned to relocate, is $11 versus $30 for the jobs that will now stay in Indianapolis, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal found. Carrier has several factories in\u00a0China, employing 2,500 workers.\u00a0 The liberal Citizens for Tax Justice lambasted the deal as a government giveaway to a large corporation already awash in federal favors. Over 15 years, it said, Carrier\u2019s parent paid a 10 percent effective federal tax rate, less than a third of the standard corporate rate.\u00a0 The organization also calculated that United Technologies has $29 billion in cash stashed offshore. Trump wants to allow U.S. multinationals to bring back the money at a low tax rate -- which means, the group said, \u201cthe incoming Trump Administration has decided more tax breaks are a fair ransom for the company\u2019s paper-thin promise to keep 1,000 jobs in the United States.\u201d To be sure, despite the agreement with Carrier, hundreds of jobs from the Indianapolis plant are being sent to Mexico. And another 700 will go there from another Carrier facility nearby that\u2019s slated to close. The company gave no sign it will stop offshoring jobs in the future. Carrier said in its statement: \u201cThis agreement in no way diminishes our belief in the benefits of free trade and that the forces of globalization will continue to require solutions for the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. and of American workers moving forward.\u201d Trump\u2019s clout appears to have tipped the balance in the Indianapolis case, because before he weighed in the company had been deaf to Indiana\u2019s entreaties. In other cases, Indiana government\u2019s efforts to fight the offshoring trend have had mixed results.\u00a0 Since Pence took over as governor in 2013, the state gave  millions in economic development money to companies that nevertheless moved production to places like Mexico and China. Those production shifts have cost thousands of Hoosiers their jobs during Pence\u2019s term in office. The Pence-led Indiana Economic Development Corporation approved $24 million in incentives, with about a third of it paid out to date, to 10 companies that transferred jobs elsewhere, according to a report last summer in the\u00a0Indianapolis Star. During that time, those companies shed more than 3,800 jobs in the state while moving operations to other countries, where labor tends to be far less expensive. Four of the companies returned $746,000 in taxpayer subsidies. But the six others have not, with no consequences, the Star found. Overall, Indiana employers have enjoyed a bounteous harvest of government subsidies, some $483 million, most of it since 2010, figures from watchdog group Good Jobs First showed. Over 80 percent of that came from Washington.\u00a0 Larry Light is a veteran financial editor and reporter who has worked for the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Business Week, Money, AdviceIQ and Newsday.",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK - Donald Trump\u2019s election as president has made many small-business owners more upbeat about 2017. Dean Bingham said he\u2019s cautiously optimistic because business picked up at his auto repair shop after the election -- people who had put off fixing their cars have decided it\u2019s time to get them serviced. \u201cOver the last month, customers have been coming in with optimism that they didn\u2019t have the last few years,\u201d said Bingham, owner of a Mr. Transmission/Milex franchise in Greenville, South Carolina. The shop has been so busy that Bingham is looking to hire a seventh employee to help out in the front while he works on cars. While many business owners are more confident because their revenue looks to increase in 2017 due to the overall improving economy, they\u2019re also optimistic because they expect Mr. Trump to deliver on promises to lower taxes and roll back regulations, including parts of the health care law. But owners may not be expecting overnight relief. Many recognize it will take time to see what the Trump administration\u2019s plans are, and what it will accomplish. Business owners were considerably more optimistic about 2017 in a survey taken shortly after the election. Forty-six percent of the 600 questioned in the Wells Fargo (WFC) survey said the operating environment for their companies would improve next year. That compares to 30 percent two years ago, after the last congressional elections.  Just over half the owners said actions that Mr. Trump and Congress will take next year will make their companies better off. Twenty-six percent said the government\u2019s actions would have no effect, and 17 percent said their businesses would be worse off. Nick Braun expects his pet insurance business to benefit because he thinks consumers will feel more comfortable about buying nonessentials like health coverage for their pets. \u201cI truly believe that 2017 will not only be a great year for our business, but the U.S. economy in general,\u201d said Braun, whose company, PetInsuranceQuotes.com, is based in Columbus, Ohio. Braun thinks promised changes to the health care law will be one factor encouraging consumers to spend on things that aren\u2019t their top priorities. He\u2019s also hoping that changes to the law will make it easier for him to buy insurance for his six staffers, which he provides even though the law doesn\u2019t require him to. He says he\u2019s had to change carriers several times because many insurance companies haven\u2019t wanted to write policies for small businesses. Some companies that cater to other small businesses see the hopefulness in their customers, and it\u2019s infectious. \u201cThe election does give me more optimism than I would have had otherwise,\u201d said Kurt Steckel, CEO of Bison Analytics, which does software consulting. Bison\u2019s inquiries from prospective clients, small companies that are looking to expand, have nearly doubled since the election. Steckel is also upbeat about an overhaul of the health care law. He said the cost of his small group insurance rose sharply when the law went into effect, and he had to stop offering coverage to his 10 staffers. He said if insurance were to become more affordable, he\u2019d restore coverage. Among the other laws and regulations that small-business advocacy groups want to see eliminated or changed are the Department of Labor\u2019s overtime rules that were scheduled to go into effect Dec. 1, but were put on hold by a federal court in Texas. Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, fast-food company CEO Andy Puzder, opposes the regulations. \u201cThe decision to appoint Puzder as labor secretary is a big indication that there\u2019s going to be a significant rollback of Obama administration initiatives,\u201d said James Hammerschmidt, a labor and business lawyer with the firm Paley Rothman in Bethesda, Maryland. Federal laws and regulations are only part of the requirements that small businesses must comply with -- state and local governments in some parts of the country have more stringent laws and rules. For example, while the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, many states and some cities have a higher minimum, and some have plans to raise it to as much as $15. \u201cSmall-business owners whose companies are located in more progressive jurisdictions or operate across local or state borders will have to deal with a patchwork of local and state employment laws that may be difficult, time-consuming and likely aggravating to navigate,\u201d Hammerschmidt said. Many owners may be cautious in the first half of 2017 while they wait to see what the government does, particularly with health care, said Walt Jones, owner of a management consulting business, SEQ Advisory Group, whose clients include small companies. He also expects owners who do business with the government to wait to see if federal agencies increase the number of contracts they award to small companies. Jones is optimistic that Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to improve the country\u2019s roads and other parts of its infrastructure will mean more government contracts, and in turn, more business for his company. \u201cAs long as the administration sticks to the promises he made during the campaign,\u201d said Jones, \u201cI definitely see opportunities for small businesses.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump, in a major upset, was elected the 45th president of the United States over Hillary Clinton. He took the stage early Wednesday morning before a raucous crowd of supporters in midtown Manhattan. \u201cI just received a call from Secretary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cShe congratulated us on our victory. And I congratulated her on a hard-fought campaign.\u201d\u00a0 He praised Clinton for the hard work she\u2019s done for the country, and told the crowd that \u201cwe owe her a major debt of gratitude\u201d for her service to our country. Polls going into Election Day had largely shown Clinton ahead by a few points, though the expectation was that the race would be tight. By early Wednesday, Trump had won 289 electoral votes and the popular vote, compared to Clinton\u2019s 218. Minnesota, Michigan and New Hampshire had not been counted yet, and Trump lost his home state of New York. After a bitterly fought election, Trump delivered a unifying message -- he called on all Republicans and Democrats to \u201ccome together as one united people\u201d and he pledged \u201cto every citizen that I will be president for all our citizens.\u201d It was a remarkably conciliatory speech from a candidate who had employed more fiery rhetoric his campaign and endured few slights silently.\u00a0 \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,\u201d he promised. Trump pledged to fix our inner cities, rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure, and \u201cfinally take care of our great veterans.\u201d\u00a0 America \u201cwill no longer settle for anything less than the best,\u201d he pledged. The U.S. will double its growth and have the \u201cstrongest economy anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump said. And he promised to seek common ground and \u201cnot hostility.\u201d Clinton\u2019s concession call came as a surprise to some of her staffers, who first heard of her call from reporters. Indeed, not long before Trump spoke, the Democratic nominee had dispatched her campaign manager, John Podesta to her election watching party at the Javits Center to send her supporters home and wait for more conclusive results.\u00a0 The crowd, which had appeared worried and despondent on TV screens as the returns for Clinton showed an ever narrower path to victory listened as Podesta told them it had been a long campaign, \u201cBut I can say, we can wait a little longer, can\u2019t we,\u201d he asked. \u201cThey\u2019re still counting votes, and every vote should count.\u201d Clinton and her campaign had been confident of victory going into election night, CBS News\u2019 Nancy Cordes reported. All of the data they were looking at told them she would win. And in the early hours Wednesday, Cordes said her campaign was going over the data again, while also looking for any voting irregularities that might have occurred. Trump\u2019s victory was a stunning upset -- the political neophyte, who thought little of data gathering, the ground game or TV ads, ended up carrying several key battleground states, including states Democrats had little to no expectation of losing. The fears of Trump\u2019s down-ballot effect also turned out to be unfounded. The Senate remains in Republican hands, as does the House. Trump\u2019s dominance was also seen during the primary season, when he knocked out 16 other Republican rivals in his party\u2019s primaries earlier this year, with a candidacy built on the slogan of \u201cmaking America great again\u201d -- a promise predicated on increased isolationism. He has proposed a ban on Muslims from entering the U.S., the building of a wall on the southern border, the tearing up of international trade deals, and the reworking of defense treaties. While garnering only lackluster support for his legislative agenda among top Republican lawmakers, Trump also alienated many for his controversial rhetoric both on the campaign trail.  Early in his primary bid, the New York businessman targeted Arizona Sen. John McCain, his party\u2019s former presidential nominee and a Vietnam War veteran, and said he wasn\u2019t a war hero \u201che was captured\u201d as a prisoner of war. His attacks on his own party elders didn\u2019t end there: Later, Trump lashed out at vocal critic South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham by giving away his personal cell phone number at a campaign rally. Trump mocked the disability of a New York Times reporter at a campaign rally after he contested the candidate\u2019s account of New Jersey Muslims celebrating 9/11.After he became the Republican nominee, Trump called House Speaker Paul Ryan a weak and ineffective leader. During the general election, after Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim soldier who lost his life fighting in the Iraq War, gave a speech at the Democratic convention criticizing Trump, the real estate magnate leveled criticisms at the Gold Star family. \u00a0And of the women who came forward and accused him of sexually predatory behavior spanning decades, he suggested they were lying -- and also unattractive enough for him to even consider assaulting.  Clinton, the strong media and polling favorite to win the election, targeted all those controversies in her campaign against Trump -- to little avail. The Democratic nominee has not yet given a concession speech. CBS News\u2019 Hannah Fraser-Chanpong contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan clashed frequently during the contentious road to Election Day. But this week on 60 Minutes, Speaker Ryan tells correspondent Scott Pelley he\u2019s put it all in the past. \u201cWe basically decided to let bygones be bygones,\u201d he tells Pelley, \u201cand let\u2019s move forward and fix this country\u2019s problems.\u201d But Speaker Ryan admitted that he really didn\u2019t expect President-elect Trump to win the election. \u201cI  didn\u2019t see this one coming,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve put last year into a movie script and taken it to Hollywood two years ago, they would\u2019ve laughed you out of the room because it wouldn\u2019t have been believable.\u201d  Now, he sounds determined to look ahead and \u201cstart passing bills.\u201d In his interview with Pelley, Speaker Ryan spelled out his agenda (in the video at the top of this page), listing his top six priorities for the first year of the Trump administration. First on the speaker\u2019s list? Repealing the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to repeal and replace Obamacare because that is really hurting families,\u201d Speaker Ryan tells Pelley. A post-election survey released this week by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation shows that just one in four Americans want to see the health care law, commonly referred to as Obamacare, repealed. What, then do Republicans plan to put in its place? \u201cPatient-centered healthcare that gets everybody access to affordable healthcare coverage, so that they can buy whatever they want to buy,\u201d Speaker Ryan tells Pelley. Beginning in January, the Speaker says Congress will put in place a budget mechanism to repeal the healthcare act while working on a policy to replace it. When Pelley pressed him further, he did say he is hopeful the Republicans\u2019 replacement plan will involve bipartisan support. Speaker Ryan\u2019s top priorities for next year also include rebuilding the military, securing the border, and reforming the tax code \u2014 and that, he says, includes lowering the corporate tax rate. \u201cIt is costing us jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons all these American companies are moving overseas.\u201d Congressional Republicans\u2019 plan is to reduce the rate from 35% to 20%, while President-elect Trump\u2019s plan is to reduce it to 15%. Speaker Ryan says he hopes to end up somewhere between 15-20%. Finding compromise within the Republican party is a problem that dogged Speaker Ryan\u2019s predecessor, John Boehner, but Ryan says he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be hampered by it. \u201cWe are now entering an era of unified government,\u201d he tells Pelley. \u201cWhat John Boehner had to heal with were the tactical disagreements among Republicans in divided government.\u201d Speaker Ryan may not have to deal with the party in-fighting, but one aspect of Congress that\u2019s unchanged is the bell system to alert House members of a quorum call. The only problem is\u2014no one knows exactly how it works, says Ryan. \u201cWhen I first got elected in 1998, they gave us a little card that explained what the bells meant and all the lights meant,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cNo one has that card anymore. Nobody knows what the bells do.\u201d The interview with 60 Minutes took place last Thursday in the Speaker\u2019s office, which offers a beautiful balcony view of the National Mall. Speaker Ryan showed Pelley the sights from his office view, including the platform, now under construction, for the upcoming presidential inauguration. \u201cThe two most prominent things on the skyline from this vantage point are the Washington Monument and the new Trump Hotel,\u201d Pelley remarks in the clip above.  \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ryan responds. \u201cHe actually noted that when I took him up here.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW YORK -- Two state politicians sued on Monday to try to stop New York City from destroying personal records related to its immigrant-friendly municipal ID cards, a move the city is considering to prevent the data from becoming a deportation tool for a new Republican federal administration.  The lawsuit comes ahead of a Dec. 31 date for the city to decide whether to delete copies of the passports, birth certificates, educational records and other documents submitted by more than 900,000 IDNYC cardholders. The date was built into the program from its 2014 start, partly out of concern about the possible election of a Republican president such as President-elect Donald Trump, whose campaign promises included deporting millions of people in the U.S. illegally.  Republican state Assembly members Ron Castorina and Nicole Malliotakis, citing state public-records laws, say in their lawsuit that destroying government records \u201cdue to the results of a federal election is against the ideals of the United States and has no basis in law.\u201d  The lawmakers, both from Staten Island, argue that the information could help to trace cardholders if they commit crimes or obtain municipal IDs under fraudulent identities, perhaps for nefarious purposes.  \u201cAs elected officials, we have a duty to protect our constituents from unlawful government action that compromises their safety,\u201d Malliotakis said in a statement.  Castorina said he was appalled that the program\u2019s authors would \u201cplay politics\u201d with the data.  Asked about the lawsuit on Monday, Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio said city officials wouldn\u2019t \u201callow ourselves to be in a situation where those records would be turned over to the federal government.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe reason people were willing to trust us is: We made very clear that there would never be a situation where it would lead to their deportation, and we\u2019re going to keep that pledge,\u201d he said.  Officials said no decision had been made on retaining the records, however.  Municipal ID programs began in 2007 in New Haven, Connecticut, and have expanded to about 10 cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. New York\u2019s program is the most ambitious.  Officials encouraged all New Yorkers to sign up, but the program was aimed at those without other forms of ID, including homeless people and, especially, the estimated 500,000 immigrants living illegally in the city. The ID would help them do such everyday things as cash checks or attend parent-teacher conferences at public schools, supporters said.  But with civil liberties advocates worried about authorities requesting the data, city law provided for destroying applicants\u2019 identity and residency information at the end of this year if administrators don\u2019t move to keep it.  \u201cProtecting it from a possible Republican president\u201d was among reasons for the provision, according to City Councilman Carlos Menchaca, a Democrat.  City officials say applicants\u2019 documents are carefully verified to guard against ID fraud, and the city notes IDNYC cards can\u2019t be used to get driver\u2019s licenses, board planes or cross borders.  \u201cClaims that IDNYC is being used by those intending serious harm is reckless fearmongering,\u201d mayoral spokeswoman Rosemary Boeglin said.  Some immigrants have said they remain hopeful the city IDs won\u2019t backfire.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "As the race in Florida tightens, some voters have resolved to support Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race and Republican Marco Rubio in his Senate re-election bid. And while these voters could help Clinton now, they have the potential to haunt her later.\u00a0 Sunshine State voters siding simultaneously with Clinton and Rubio  largely fall into two categories: Republicans who feel they can\u2019t support Trump, and Hispanic voters who value Rubio\u2019s roots. Warren Chase is one of the lifelong Florida Republicans who will vote for Clinton. After having volunteered in seven Republican presidential campaigns, he calls his decision to leave the Republican Party -- and register as an independent -- an emotional one. But also says it had to be done.  \u201cI view Trump as a threat to our national security  from within our own borders. It is that basic,\u201d explains Chase. \u201cThere are times when we all have to take a stand. For me that time is now to  say country first, party second. And to say no to Donald Trump,\u201d Chase says in a radio ad that he made for the  Clinton campaign.  Still, even though Chase has left the Republican  party, he is voting for Rubio, who is narrowly leading his Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy, in the polls. And Chase is not alone. Linda Fogg, a lifelong Republican living in Florida,  has started a group called \u201cRepublicans for Hillary.\u201d The group has taken root, with about 40 members, in The Villages, FL. The location is significant as it is the largest retirement community in the country and a reliably Republican stronghold. Though in Fogg\u2019s  eyes, Trump has been the catalyst for the Republican party\u2019s implosion. \u201cWhen we have a candidate at the top of the ticket  that insults women, minorities, immigrants, our war heroes like John McCain, and mocks the disabled, this individual is not a candidate for president of the United States. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s qualified to lead anything, including my local homeowners association,\u201d  Fogg says with a laugh.  Fogg speaks in lukewarm terms about Clinton and  has absolute plans to return to the Republican Party in 2020. What if there is a Clinton-Rubio matchup? \u201cWithout a doubt\u201d Fogg says she will cast her vote for Rubio. According to Fogg, just about everyone in her \u201cRepublicans for Hillary\u201d group is casting  a split ballot this go-round and could return to the GOP in earnest in 2020. Clinton has a thicker foundation of party  support than Trump does. In a CBS News poll released Sunday, 91 percent of registered Floridian Democratic voters back Clinton while 86 percent of registered Republican voters back Trump. Additionally, 7 percent of Republicans said that they would support Clinton, while 5 percent of Democrats say they would vote for Trump.\u00a0 More than 6 million ballots have been cast in  Florida via early voting, and Democrats have an advantage of about .5 percent in the current totals. Yet voters like Linda and Warren prove that those numbers cannot be interpreted so simply.  \u201cThe numbers now say they are pretty much even  but that does not necessarily mean they are even in terms of votes,\u201d says Steve Schale, Obama\u2019s Florida State Director in 2008. \u201cIf just 2 percent Republicans vote for Clinton than Democrats who vote for Trump that is almost an entire point in somebody\u2019s column.\u201d There is also a group of Hispanics -- Republican, Democrat and no-party affiliation voters alike -- who are going to split their ticket. Sarah Guerrero, a 19-year old Columbian-American living  in Tampa, has given up on the GOP because of the Trump factor.  \u201cI am a female Hispanic immigrant I could not imagine  having a president saying the things Donald Trump has expressed,\u201d she says, in explaining why she is voting for Clinton. \u201cI am heartbroken for the Republican Party. I registered as a Republican when I turned 18...Then Donald Trump.  He just kind of alienated us, at least for Hispanic Republicans.\u201d Guerrero has not given up forever, she hopes that  leaders like Rubio can re-create the party she once identified with. If he gets into the race in 2020, she says she will vote for him. Even though Rubio has said he will serve his full six-year Senate term, Florida Republicans tend to think he\u2019ll run for president again in 2020. \u201cIf Hillary wins, that is the matchup Marco has  been waiting for,\u201d explains David Johnson, formerly the state\u2019s Republican Party interim executive director.  Other establishment Republicans in Florida, like  the former party Chair Al Cardenas, are not worried about these split-ticket voters Clinton supporting her four years from now.  \u201cIf Republicans are voting for Clinton and Rubio  it means they are not leaving the party altogether. If they did not split vote and went all the way with Democrats and left republican party in droves that would be a real problem,\u201d explains Cardenas, an anti-Trump republican.  Some split ticket voters are willing to put it  bluntly, saying Clinton should be weary of losing their support four years from now \u201cYes, she should be afraid,\u201d asserts Karen Diaz Suarez, a 57-year-old old Puerto Rican who is voting for Clinton and Rubio. What about 2020? \u201cIf he runs, we will see.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "On the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed to build a wall at the Southern border, ban Muslims from entering the U.S., eliminate gun-free zones, repeal Obamacare, and bring back manufacturing jobs. Now that he\u2019s won the presidency, he may be able to follow through on some of those promises -- but not all of them -- even with the support of a Republican House and Senate, experts say. Trump has vowed to launch his presidency by cracking down on trade deals, immigrants and Barack Obama\u2019s environmental policies, and there are things the new chief executive will be able to accomplish with the stroke of a pen. Here\u2019s a look at some of them. The friction between Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and Trump has been well-documented. But according to a New York Times review of Kelly\u2019s memoir, she writes that Trump was upset prior to the first Republican primary debate in 2015, phoning Fox executives to say he\u2019d heard the first question \u201cwas a very pointed question directed at him.\u201d President Obama and his successor smiled and shook hands for reporters after they met for the first time, but there were a few things noticeably missing -- and they could be telling. Defense Secretary Ash Carter will be with Mr. Obama today when he spends his last Veterans Day at Arlington National Cemetery as commander in chief. Carter has already taken steps to ensure a smooth transition at the Defense Department to the next administration. Only on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d in his first interview since the election, the Pentagon chief offers advice to the Trump team. Voters in eight U.S. states chose to legalize recreational use of marijuana, potentially \u00a0providing a big lift for the budding cannabis industry. But skepticism about the legalization push on the part of key members of the incoming Trump team, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence, could snuff out efforts to decriminalize pot at the federal level. The leader of the company behind the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline believes Trump will help the project get finished. Trump is a stockholder in Energy Transfer Partners, and CEO Kelcy Warren donated to Trump\u2019s campaign. Protesters from more than 200 Native American tribes have been camped out near the site since August, seeking to have work on the pipeline stopped. Unmarried gay couples who get domestic partner health care benefits through an employer may want to consider tying the knot. A growing number of U.S. companies are eliminating their health coverage for unmarried partners, reasoning that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s move to effectively legalize same-sex marriage makes such benefits moot.

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump is tapping Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chairman, to join his new administration as chief of staff, Trump\u2019s transition team announced Sunday. Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign\u2019s CEO and former head of Breitbart news, will also be on the White House leadership team as the chief strategist. \u201cI am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cSteve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.\u201d Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager and now a senior adviser to the presidential transition team, hinted at Priebus\u2019 appointment on Saturday. \u201cI think chairman Priebus has expressed an interest in the position,\u201d she told reporters Saturday at Trump Tower, adding that there were \u201cseveral people being considered.\u201d One of the other possible candidates, CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett reported last week, included Bannon.\u00a0 Bannon thanked Trump in a statement for his role with the new White House, going on to comment on his future relationship with Priebus as chief of staff. \u00a0 \u201cWe had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWe will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda.\u201d Bannon, who holds anti-establishment views, has drawn repeated heat over the course of the election for his connections to Breitbart News, the conservative website that heralded the rise of alt-right ideologies this campaign cycle.\u00a0 But Trump picking  Priebus, whose tenure as party chair puts him squarely within Washington insider circles, as chief of staff also signals the president-elect\u2019s willingness to make nice with the Republican establishment. Priebus called it \u201can honor\u201d to join Trump at the White House.\u00a0 \u201cI am very grateful to the President-elect for this opportunity to serve him and this nation as we work to create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHe will be a great President for all Americans.\u201d Trump has heaped praise on the RNC chair for his leadership within the Republican party throughout the contentious primary and general election fight.\u00a0 Back in July, Trump took to Twitter to call Priebus \u201cthe tough one and the smart one,\u201d especially compared to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s then-chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.\u00a0 Even dating back to 2012, Trump complimented Priebus for \u201cdoing a fantastic job,\u201d saying he hoped \u201che gets the credit he deserves.\u201d\u00a0 .@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves. Despite several prominent Republican party members calling for the GOP to denounce Trump throughout the past year and a half, Priebus has remained fiercely loyal to the nominee throughout the businessman\u2019s presidential campaign. In an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d earlier this year, Priebus even urged any holdouts among Trump\u2019s former primary challengers to fall in line behind him -- or face the consequences.\u00a0 \u201cThose people need to get on board,\u201d Priebus said in September. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re thinking they\u2019re going to run again someday, I think that we\u2019re going to evaluate the process \u2013 of the nomination process and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that easy for them.\u201d Priebus has weathered some rocky moments in his relationship with the president-elect. Before Trump became the party\u2019s nominee, he leveled continuous attacks against the RNC and the party\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d primary system.\u00a0 But even after getting battered by Trump\u2019s criticisms, the RNC chair remained resilient, telling \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in April that he didn\u2019t take the attacks to heart.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t take it personally, because I kind of just rest in the truth,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt matters when something is right and something is wrong to me.\u201d CBS News\u2019 Arden Farhi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "DETROIT -- President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. wouldn\u2019t be moving the production of a Lincoln line from Kentucky to Mexico. Bill Ford, the company\u2019s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! Ford doesn\u2019t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there.  A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford had been considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. Company spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn\u2019t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It\u2019s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \u201cWe are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\u201d Baker said in an e-mail. The development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn\u2019t change the company\u2019s plan. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. Ford plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it\u2019s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. Bill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said.",

            "article_content": "BEIJING -- China said Saturday its military seized a U.S. Navy unmanned underwater glider in the South China Sea but it would give the drone back. But President-elect Donald Trump tweeted later that the Chinese government should be told \u201cwe don\u2019t want the drone they stole back\u201d and \u201clet them keep it!\u201d\u00a0 We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it! This comes after United States officials had confirmed that they \u201csecured an understanding\u201d for the return of the device. Trump\u2019s evening tweet may extend one of the most serious incidents between the American and the Chinese militaries in years.  The Chinese navy on Thursday seized the drone, which the Pentagon said was being operated by civilian contractors to conduct oceanic research. The U.S. lodged a formal diplomatic complaint and demanded the drone back.  Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun issued a statement late Saturday saying that a Chinese navy lifeboat discovered an unknown device in the South China Sea on Thursday.  \u201cIn order to prevent this device from posing a danger to the safe navigation of passing ships and personnel, the Chinese lifeboat adopted a professional and responsible attitude in investigating and verifying the device,\u201d Yang said.  The statement said that after verifying that the device was an American unmanned submerged device, \u201cChina decided to transfer it to the U.S. through appropriate means.\u201d  The U.S. said that \u201cthrough direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return\u201d the unmanned underwater vehicle, according to a statement from Peter Cook, spokesman for U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter.  But Trump, after holding a rally to thank supporters for his election, took to Twitter to criticize the deal. \u201cWe should tell China that we don\u2019t want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!\u201d the president-elect tweeted Saturday evening.  He earlier in the day had blasted the seizure.  Misspelling \u201cunprecedented,\u201d he tweeted: \u201cChina steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented act.\u201d He later reissued the tweet, correcting the spelling.  China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act. The U.S. said China\u2019s \u201cunlawful seizure\u201d came in international waters. Yet China pointedly accused the U.S. of long sending ships \u201cin China\u2019s presence\u201d to conduct \u201cmilitary surveying.\u201d  \u201cChina is resolutely opposed to this and requests the U.S. stop such activities,\u201d it said. \u201cChina will continue to maintain vigilance against the relevant U.S. activities and will take necessary measures to deal with them.\u201d  Earlier Saturday, China\u2019s foreign ministry said the country\u2019s military was in contact with its American counterparts on \u201cappropriately handling\u201d the incident, though it offered no details on what discussions were underway.  The drone was seized while collecting unclassified scientific data about 92 kilometers (57 miles) northwest of Subic Bay near the Philippines in the South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday.  \u201cIt is ours. It\u2019s clearly marked as ours. We would like it back, and we would like this not to happen again,\u201d Davis told reporters. He said the drone costs about $150,000 and is largely commercial, off-the-shelf technology.  The USNS Bowditch, which is not a combat ship, was stopped in international waters Thursday afternoon and recovering two of the gliders when the Chinese ship approached, Davis said. The two vessels were within about 450 meters (500 yards) of each other. He said the USNS Bowditch carries some small arms, but that no shots were fired.  According to the Pentagon, as the Chinese ship left with the drone, which is about 3 meters (10 feet) long, its only radio response to the U.S. vessel was, \u201cWe are returning to normal operations.\u201d  Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the seizure of the glider occurred inside the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, not China, and appeared to be a violation of international law.  China delineates its South China Sea claims with a roughly drawn sea border known as the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d that runs along the west coast of the Philippines. However, it hasn\u2019t explicitly said whether it considers those waters as sovereign territory, and says it doesn\u2019t disrupt the passage of other nations\u2019 shipping through the area. The U.S. doesn\u2019t take a position on sovereignty claims, but insists on freedom of navigation, including the right of its naval vessels to conduct training and other operations in the sea.  Davis said that the incident could be the first time in recent history that China has taken a U.S. naval vessel. Some observers have called it the most significant dispute between the sides\u2019 militaries since the April 2001 midair collision between a U.S. Navy surveillance aircraft and a Chinese fighter jet about 110 kilometers (70 miles) from China\u2019s Hainan island that led to the death of a Chinese pilot.  The drone seizure seemed likely to fray the already tense relations between U.S. and China. Beijing was angered by Trump\u2019s decision to talk by phone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Dec. 2, and by his later comments that he did not feel \u201cbound by a one-China policy\u201d regarding the status of Taiwan, unless the U.S. could gain trade or other benefits from China. China considers the self-governing island its own territory to be recovered by force if it deems necessary.  There also have been increased tensions over Beijing\u2019s ongoing military buildup in the South China Sea, mainly the development and militarization of man-made shoals and islands aimed at extending China\u2019s reach in the strategically vital area, through which about $5 trillion in global trade passes annually.

            "article_content": "The following is a script from \u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu,\u201d which aired on Dec. 11, 2016. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Shachar Bar-On and Alexandra Poolos, producers. On our recent trip to Jerusalem, we found a surprisingly optimistic Benjamin Netanyahu, who has served the longest stretch as prime minister in Israel\u2019s history. He told us his country has never felt as secure or less isolated.\u00a0 But it\u2019s been a tumultuous eight years between Israel and the U.S. over the Iran nuclear deal and the expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. So part of his optimism relates to the election in the U.S. Netanyahu and his followers on the Israeli right, are greeting the idea of President Donald Trump with a resounding l\u2019chaim.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: I know Donald Trump.\u00a0 I know him very well.\u00a0 And I think his attitude, his support for Israel is clear.\u00a0 He feels very warmly about the Jewish state, about the Jewish people and about Jewish people. There\u2019s no question about that. Lesley Stahl: With Trump, do you think that Israel will not be as at odds with the United States as you have been under the Obama administration? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, we had differences of opinion with-- I had differences of opinion with President Obama and most well-known, of course, is Iran. Lesley Stahl: Was it personal between the two of you? Benjamin Netanyahu: No. No. I don\u2019t think so. I think that suppose we had the greatest of personal chemistry, OK? So, what? You think I wouldn\u2019t stand up against the Iran deal if I thought, as I did, that it endangers the existence of Israel? Of course I would.  He says it wasn\u2019t personal but there were times when it sure seemed that way. The relationship, often rocky, hit bottom when Mr. Netanyahu took the provocative step last year of lobbying against the Iran nuclear deal and by extension President Obama in a speech before Congress. Netanyahu in Congress: It doesn\u2019t block Iran\u2019s path to the bomb, it paves Iran\u2019s path to the bomb. So why would anyone make this deal?  Lesley Stahl: When you campaigned against him and you spoke to the Congress, it was read as a lack of respect and something that had never been done before. Benjamin Netanyahu: No, it was not borne of any disrespect, because I have the greatest respect for him.\u00a0 I had then and I have now. Lesley Stahl: But do you regret that you did that? Benjamin Netanyahu: No, on the contrary.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s my responsibility, to speak up when something threatens our very future. He\u2019s says he\u2019s going to see Mr. Trump soon to lobby him to scuttle the deal. The president-elect has called the agreement \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201ca disgrace.\u201d\u00a0 But Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary, General James Mattis, has advised against pulling out. \u00a0 Lesley Stahl: If it were to be abrogated wouldn\u2019t that put you in a more precarious position than you are now? Because they would obviously then rush to the bomb. Benjamin Netanyahu: I think Iran didn\u2019t rush to the bomb before there was a deal. Lesley Stahl: Really? Benjamin Netanyahu: No, because they were afraid of retribution. Lesley Stahl: But if-- OK, you get rid of the deal. Then what? Benjamin Netanyahu: I think what options we have are much more than you think.\u00a0 Many more.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll talk about it \u2013 Lesley Stahl: Like what? Benjamin Netanyahu: --with President Trump.\u00a0 Well, I think quite a few, actually. Lesley Stahl: Because if you, you know, put sanctions back on, the other signatories to the deal won\u2019t. Benjamin Netanyahu: There are ways, various ways of undoing it.\u00a0  Lesley Stahl: You have something in your mind. Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, I have about five things in my mind. Lesley Stahl: Well, give me one. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, I\u2019d like to talk to the president before I talk to the 60 Minutes. Lesley Stahl: What about the intelligence that the West is getting from on-site inspections?\u00a0 Apparently, most of the intelligence community thinks it\u2019s worth keeping the deal for that intelligence. Benjamin Netanyahu: I think we have-- the deal is not the critical thing of intelligence. Intelligence is a critical thing. Lesley Stahl: Which Israel is really good at. Benjamin Netanyahu: Which is-- we\u2019re very good at. And you know, with a little help\u2014 Lesley Stahl: So you don\u2019t think we\u2019re\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: --from our friends. Lesley Stahl: --gaining that much by these on-site inspections? Benjamin Netanyahu: For intelligence? Lesley Stahl: Yeah. Benjamin Netanyahu: No. Lesley Stahl: What about the silver lining? That because of this deal, you now have all this-- these better relationships with your neighbors. Benjamin Netanyahu: Oh, well, that\u2019s true. I would say- I will say this. The only good thing I can say about the deal with Iran is that it brought the Arab states and Israel closer together.  It\u2019s the old proverb: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. On a trip to the desert town of Be\u2019er Sheva, he told us there\u2019s been a tectonic shift: it\u2019s been reported that Israel and the Arab world are sharing intelligence. \u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: All I can tell you is that Israel\u2019s position in the Arab world has changed because they no longer see Israel as their enemy, but as their ally, in their indispensable battle against the forces of militant Islam, either those led by Iran, the Shiites, or-- and those led by Daesh \u2013 by ISIS, the militant Sunnis.  Lesley Stahl: We hear that you have dramatically improved your relationship with Egypt. Is that correct? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Jordan? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Saudi Arabia? Benjamin Netanyahu: No comment. Lesley Stahl: I have to ask you, because it\u2019s the most fascinating of all: Israel and Saudi Arabia. Are you actually developing an anti-Iran alliance in the Middle East? Benjamin Netanyahu: Doesn\u2019t have to be developed. It\u2019s there anyway. Israel is developing a whole skein of new alliances, in some cases with countries that have been challenging the U.S. around the world like Russia which has placed its troops in Syria, Israel\u2019s next door neighbor. Lesley Stahl: How would you describe your relationship with Russia right now? Benjamin Netanyahu: It\u2019s amicable. But the minute Mr. Putin decided to put his military forces in Syria, I went to see him.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cLook, here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. \u00a0I\u2019m not intervening in Syria. But at the same time, if Syria tries to intervene with us, if Iran tries to use Syria to attack us, we\u2019ll stop it.  Lesley Stahl: You\u2019re telling Mr. Putin that you will attack? Benjamin Netanyahu: I said, \u201cWe should avoid this.\u201d\u00a0 And he said \u201cI agree.\u201d\u00a0 So we coordinated between our militaries because no one wants an inadvertent Israeli-Russian clash. Lesley Stahl: You have a friendship with Mr. Putin, and a friendship with China. You seem to be inching toward an anti-American bloc. Benjamin Netanyahu: God, no.\u00a0 Let me tell you something\u2014 Lesley Stahl: Well, talk about that \u2018cause I think there\u2019s an impression of that. Benjamin Netanyahu: That\u2019s a false impression.\u00a0 First of all, there is, there is an irreplaceable ally.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the United States of America. Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but here you are making friends with our adversaries\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: So no. You have relations with Russia and you have relations with China. We can have relations, economic relations, trade relations with other countries as you do.\u00a0 Why not? He has used economic and trade relations to improve Israel\u2019s standing in the world by selling and in some cases giving away its high-tech inventions. Israel boasts of more start-ups per capita than anywhere in the world, many based in Be\u2019er Sheva, and nations have lined up to buy drones, as India has, and cutting-edge agricultural technology, as China has. There\u2019s excitement about a new innovation that extracts drinking water out of air.\u00a0  Lesley Stahl: So this is Israeli diplomacy through technology? Benjamin Netanyahu: Exactly right. Lesley Stahl: Countries that used to vote against you regularly at the U.N., are now your clients. I mean African nations - . Benjamin Netanyahu: It\u2019s a revolution there.\u00a0 We can\u2019t keep up.  What\u2019s surprising is that he\u2019s making progress with all these countries without making any progress with the Palestinians, who\u2019ve lived under Israeli occupation in the West Bank for half a century.  Lesley Stahl: What about the quality of Palestinians\u2019 lives. You know, it\u2019s 50 years since what people call \u201cthe occupation.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s 50 years. You still have checkpoints.\u00a0 People have to be cleared. Soldiers everywhere in their lives.\u00a0  Benjamin Netanyahu: Actually, I\u2019ve lifted checkpoints quite a bit and we\u2019re trying to create bridges and thoroughfares and so on so we can have freer movement. Palestinians know-- they look at Aleppo in Syria, and they look at Yemen, and they look at Libya, and they look at other places, and they know that our intention is coexistence. Lesley Stahl: You told us that Israel is less isolated today than it has been in many years in the past. And yet, at the same time, you\u2019re losing support in-- in Western Europe. Benjamin Netanyahu: Isolated?? All these countries are coming to Israel and it\u2019s a fantastic change. Lesley Stahl: But not Western Europe.\u00a0 Not you, your natural allies, or your older allies yet. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, they\u2019re coming\u2014 Lesley Stahl: They call you colonials. Benjamin Netanyahu: They\u2019re coming around too.  Lesley Stahl: But they call you occupiers. Benjamin Netanyahu: Well they call us a lot of things but I think they\u2019re coming around too, I have to tell you. But criticism has spread, on U.S. campuses too.  Lesley Stahl: There\u2019s a movement called BDS, to boycott, divest, and sanction Israel and its products, because of the Palestinian issue, the unresolved Palestinian issue. And this is the playbook that they used, you know, against Apartheid in South Africa\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, well, I don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s not about this or that issue. It\u2019s against the very existence of the State of Israel. Lesley Stahl: You know what they want? I know what they want.\u00a0 They want you to stop expanding and building settlements. Benjamin Netanyahu: Yea, well, we did. We stopped. We stopped in Gaza. We tore out the settlements and gave the Palestinians Gaza.\u00a0 And what happened?\u00a0 Did we get peace?\u00a0 We got 20,000 rockets on our heads and terror tunnels.  Still, his critics argue that\u2019s not a justification. For the steady expansion of the settlements in the West Bank. Those settlements are smothering Palestinians\u2019 hope for their own separate state.  Benjamin Netanyahu: I think the obsession, the focus on settlements as though this were the issue and this is the obstacle to peace, I disagree with that. Lesley Stahl: But it is an obstacle. I mean\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: No, it\u2019s not an obstacle. Lesley Stahl:\u00a0 Well, you say that, but they don\u2019t say that. \u00a0\u00a0 Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah, but I\u2019ll say something else. The real reason we haven\u2019t had peace is because of a persistent refusal of the Palestinians to recognize a Jewish state in any border. \u201cYou ask us to recognize you, I\u2019m willing to do that. I ask you to recognize us. Recognize the Jewish state, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d And if they do, this thing will begin to correct itself very quickly.\u00a0  It\u2019s a condition he doesn\u2019t put on his new friends.\u00a0  Lesley Stahl: Have any of the Arab states said they accept Israel as a Jewish state? Benjamin Netanyahu: Yeah they say a lot of things in various forms. \u00a0  Lesley Stahl: And never actually said they accept you. Benjamin Netanyahu: Do they say it publicly at this point?\u00a0 Not yet.\u00a0  He acknowledges that the Arab states want to see movement on the Palestinian issue. \u00a0 But despite Washington\u2019s call for a halt, settlement expansion has continued, even after the U.S. gave Israel a $38 billion military aid package. Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas recently greeted each other at the funeral of former Israeli President Shimon Peres. But the two have not held open, direct negotiations in over six years, for which they blame each other.\u00a0  Lesley Stahl: What kind of a state is it going to be if you just, you know, don\u2019t do anything? Benjamin Netanyahu: I\u2019m not going to just not do anything. I\u2019m going to do something. Lesley Stahl: Well, if you don\u2019t negotiate with the Palestinians\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Well, I\u2019m willing to negotiate with them at any moment.  Lesley Stahl: And if it doesn\u2019t happen? Benjamin Netanyahu: I haven\u2019t reversed my position.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said, \u201cLook, we will solve this because we want two nation states at peace and with the proper security arrangements. Lesley Stahl: You would be pushing for a two-state solution if that\u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu: Two states for two peoples. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m focused.\u00a0 Yeah, I\u2019d like to have President Trump, when he gets into the White House, help me work on that.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to see if the Arab states can help me achieve that.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new reality.\u00a0 A new possibility.\u00a0 One of America's most recognized and experienced broadcast journalists, Lesley Stahl has been a 60 Minutes correspondent since 1991.",

            "article_content": "Following a deal struck with the Carrier air-conditioning company to keep jobs in the U.S. in exchange for enormous tax subsidies, President-elect Donald Trump is now taking aim at other companies thinking of offshoring their operations.  Mr. Trump fired off a series of tweets Sunday, cautioning manufacturers that a move outside of the U.S. would be a very \u201cexpensive mistake.\u201d He doubled down on previous claims he will instate a 35 percent tax for those companies wanting to sell their products in the U.S., and also offered another incentive to keep them in the country: The companies, he tweeted, will be \u201cable to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged.\u201d  The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S.  ...... without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ...... wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but..... these companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very ... expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS Last week, the president-elect began the first leg of his post-election victory tour in two Midwest cities, Cincinnati and Indianapolis. In the Indiana manufacturing hub, Mr. Trump celebrated the deal with Carrier, which kept about 1,000 jobs in the state, without mentioning that several hundred will still be moving to Mexico. The air-conditioning and furnace plant, in return, would receive about $7 million in state tax breaks over ten years. The arrangement was brokered largely with the help of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, also Indiana\u2019s governor. Carrier could still face the taxes Mr. Trump threatened against other companies, however.  In an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming White House chief of staff, said \u201cit\u2019s possible,\u201d penalties could still be leveled against the company, considering they\u2019ve continued to shift some jobs south of the border. \u201cIt\u2019s not specific to Carrier,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt\u2019s a position across the board.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s Carrier transaction, however, has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle in recent days. The Wall Street Journal published an editorial on the business \u201cshakedown,\u201d while prominent voices on the left and right also denounced it. Conservative commentator Sarah Palin, a one-time Republican vice presidential nominee, said the administration was unfairly \u201cfavoring one business over another.\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in a Washington Post op-ed, said it \u201csignaled to every corporation in America that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for business-friendly tax benefits and incentives.\u201d Vice president-elect Mike Pence also defended the deal he had a heavy hand in, telling ABC News on Sunday that the administration was not \u201cpicking winners and losers at all.\u201d  \u201cWhat the president-elect did with Carrier was simply reach out one American to another and ask them to reconsider,\u201d Pence said. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement at the Carrier plant Thursday, the president-elect has also trained his Twitter account on Rexnord, a bearings manufacturing plant in Indianapolis which will see a few hundred jobs shifted to Mexico by next year.\u00a0 Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!",

            "article_content": "KAMPALA, Uganda - Scores of people have been killed in fighting between Ugandan forces and a tribal militia in a remote district near the border with Congo, Ugandan officials said Sunday as security forces battled armed men protecting a tribal king who is accused of leading the rebels.\u00a0 At least 54 people, including 41 rebels and 13 police officers, have been killed in clashes in Uganda\u2019s Rwenzori region, police spokesman Felix Kaweesi told reporters. Four police officials and four soldiers have been wounded, he said. The killings are an escalation of a long-running conflict between Ugandan security forces and rebels who are believed to be loyal to a tribal king, Charles Wesley Mumbere, a critic of the country\u2019s long-time president. Mumbere was arrested after the killings, accused of inciting violence, reports the BBC. Mumbere worked as a nurse\u2019s aide in Maryland and Pennsylvania for years, caring for the elderly and sick, before being crowned king in 2009. President Yoweri Museveni has officially recognized Mumbere\u2019s 300,000-strong Rwenzururu Kingdom. Government recognition does not grant any executive power but allows the monarchs to determine cultural and social issues affecting their people. The King of Uganda\u2019s Mountains of the Moon has undergone many transformations in his life - from teenage leader of a rebel force to impoverished student to a nursing home assistant working two jobs in the U.S., where he lived for nearly 25 years. He inherited the title when his father, Isaya Mukirania Kibanzanga, died while leading a secessionist group in the Rwenzori Mountains, otherwise known as the Mountains of the Moon. The rebels were protesting the oppression of their Bakonzo ethnic group by their then-rulers, the Toro Kingdom. The Bakonzo demanded to be recognized as a separate entity and named Kibanzanga, a former primary school teacher, as their king in 1963. Shortly after Kibanzanga died, his son led the fighters down from the mountains to hand in their weapons. Mumbere went to the United States in 1984 on a Uganda government scholarship, attending a business school until Uganda\u2019s leadership changed and the stipend was stopped.\u00a0 Now it appears the peace between the Mountains of the Moon and the Ugandan government has ended. Gunfire rang out outside the king\u2019s palace Sunday as Ugandan troops tried to break into the premises and disarm his guards. After the rebels had killed four police officers, security forces launched an operation to disarm the royal guards and other armed supporters of Mumbere in the region, government spokesman Col. Shaban Bantariza told The Associated Press. Mumbere and some of his supporters are now calling for secession from Uganda, according to Bantariza, who said he had seen copies of money printed by the secessionist group, which is hoping to create a republic known as Yiira. Mumbere has denied any role in the attacks on police posts. The western district of Kasese, where Mumbere is based, is a hotbed of opposition to President Yoweri Museveni, who lost there in the last presidential polls. Some of the rebels had climbed high up the Rwenzori mountains and set up military camps from which they were said to run a small government, even collecting taxes from the people they control. The rebels are armed with modern weapons and improvised explosive devices, according to Bantariza. \u201cThey had shut down life in the areas they occupied,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shall beat those who want to cause trouble on our land.\u201d Museveni, in power since 1986, has struggled to win over the support of the Bakonzo people in presidential elections. There are frequent land disputes in the area, with many accusing the government of sponsoring land grabs. A new plan to divide up Kasese into two parts has also been fiercely opposed.

            "article_content": "The post-election stock market surge has been getting all the attention. Donald Trump\u2019s surprise victory surprisingly pushed the Dow Jones industrials index to a new record high on hopes of an aggressive fiscal stimulus push from his proposed tax cuts and infrastructure spending. But other markets have been decidedly less enthusiastic about the flaxen-haired billionaire who has shaken the political establishment. Emerging market currencies have been hammered. Tech stocks have wilted.  And, arguably most important, bond prices have plummeted, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.2 percent (yields and prices move in opposite directions). That\u2019s the highest level since January. The iShares 20+ Treasury Bond\u00a0(TLT) exchange-traded fund has dropped more than 14 percent from its July high, with half of the decline coming this week alone.\u00a0 Here are three warnings to be taken from the harrowing decline in bond prices: Inflation is coming The primary fuel for the surge in interest rates (chart above), and thus the weakness of bond prices, has been a jump in inflation expectations. A market-based measure, looking at the relationship between inflation-protected Treasury bonds vs. the regular variety, has increased to levels not seen since the summer of 2015.  The short version of it all is that Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus plans -- coming so late in the business cycle with the unemployment rate already below 5 percent -- are likely to be highly inflationary, according to Capital Economics because inflation and wage growth \u201care already showing signs of accelerating.\u201d The firm estimates his proposed tax cuts would be worth up to $5 trillion over the next decade, while his infrastructure spending plans could come in around $1 trillion over five years. Add in a pledge to increase military spending, build the southern border wall and other proposals, and the economy is set to get a big push at a time when the labor market is near full capacity.  The result could be a more aggressive path of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, further bond losses and higher borrowing costs for consumers.  Trump could blow up the national debt As structured now, Trump\u2019s plans are set to\u00a0double the national debt, per the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, at a cost of nearly $12 trillion over the next 10 years. To stabilize the debt, according to the committee\u2019s estimates, U.S. economic growth would need to clock in at 5.4 percent vs. the 2.1 percent growth projected. And to balance the budget under Trump, growth would need to come in at a whopping 10.3 percent.  Another option would be spending cuts, with a 27 percent drop in spending needed to stabilize the debt. Or some combination of higher growth and spending cuts. The trouble with this, however, is that if we only look at nonentitlement outlays beyond areas including Social Security and Medicare, federal spending would need to drop by half to merely stabilize the debt.  Add it all together, and unless growth more than doubles and nonentitlement spending drops by about a quarter, the national debt will continue to grow. With the debt ceiling needing to be raised by March, bond prices are weakening as traders realize the flood of borrowing will continue.  China and other nations are getting nervous  Another tenet of Trump\u2019s economic plans is his call to renegotiate trade deals, label China a currency manipulator and potentially buy back or otherwise restructure the national debt at a discount. This has resulted in selling pressure in emerging market currencies and equities as investors worry about the economic impact to export-oriented nations.  Many of these nations have been aggressively selling their Treasury bond reserves, contributing to the falling prices and rising yields. Part of their motivation is a need to raise cash to defend their currencies in the open market. And part is the fear of sustaining losses from a Trump debt restructuring and/or higher inflation.  To be fair, the selling dynamic was in high gear before Trump won: Foreign central banks sold a record $346 billion worth of U.S. Treasury bonds in the 12 months through August. But the turnover in Washington will now only accelerate the trend.  Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge\r\n, an investment advisory newsletter, and Edge Pro, options newsletter.

            "article_content": "As President-elect Donald Trump considers who should fill the country\u2019s key economic roles, Wilbur Ross is said to be a top contender to lead the Commerce Department. An ally during Trump\u2019s election campaign, the 78-year-old mild-spoken Ross is known for rescuing the types of old-fashioned industrial businesses that Trump has vowed to revive: steel, mining and textiles.\u00a0 Ross is chairman of WL Ross & Co., an investment firm that specializes in corporate restructurings. As Commerce Department secretary, Ross would serve as the country\u2019s chief business promoter and overseer of trade and investment issues, in addition to running such major agencies as the Census Bureau and Patent and Trademark Office. During the campaign, Ross often appeared on business news shows to explain Trump\u2019s positions, sometimes softening or downplaying the candidate\u2019s protectionist trade policies.\u00a0 While Ross doesn\u2019t have the type of lobbying or banking ties that have raised eyebrows with some of Trump\u2019s other potential administration picks, he doesn\u2019t lack for his own entanglements and controversial history. He built his estimated $2.9 billion fortune by snapping up distressed industrial businesses, such as steelmaker LTV.\u00a0 While that helped save jobs in hard-hit Rust Belt states, workers often bore the cost in the form of pared-back retirement and health care benefits. That has led some to label him a \u201cvulture investor\u201d more interested in stripping corporate assets for profit than reviving ailing companies.\u00a0 But Ross rejects the label, saying the companies he invests in would be liquidated without the financial backing. More recently, his rhetoric has also echoed that of President-elect Trump\u2019s campaign speeches. \u201cWe need a more radical, new approach to government -- at least in the U.S. -- from what we\u2019ve had before,\u201d Ross said earlier this year, explaining his support for Trump. \u201cThe middle class and lower middle class in America has not really benefited by the last 10 to 15 years of economic activity, and they\u2019re sick and tired of it and they want something different.\u201d Ross might be best known to voters as the owner of Sago Mine, a West Virginia coal mine where a dozen miners lost their lives in a 2006 explosion. He called that tragedy \u201cthe worst week of my life.\u201d (As Commerce secretary, he wouldn\u2019t oversee mining regulations, which fall under the Department of Labor.) Ross\u2019 own track record suggests that while he has helped some Americans -- including his investors -- he often casts his eyes beyond U.S. borders to make lucrative deals.\u00a0 One of his most successful business ventures was creating International Steel Group in 2002, which was formed from bankrupt producers including Bethlehem Steel and LTV. After taking the conglomerate public, he sold it to India\u2019s Mittal Steel in 2005 for $4.5 billion. At the time, The Wall Street Journal reported that International Steel\u2019s investors earned a 12-fold profit.\u00a0 Ross also has business ties in China, a country that has served as a focal point for Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies. In an interview with Bloomberg News in October, Ross said his company has a joint venture with a large electric utility in China, which he said is an industry \u201cthat\u2019s been getting good support\u201d from the Chinese government. He also said he had recently visited China to scout out more investment deals.\u00a0 Those ties might suggest conflicts between Ross\u2019 investments and Trump\u2019s protectionist policies, which include a 45 percent tariff on imports from China. The president-elect\u2019s rhetoric on trade has included allegations that China is manipulating its currency to make its exports more affordable for U.S. consumers.\u00a0 \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump said earlier this year at a campaign rally.\u00a0 Ross, though, has downplayed Trump\u2019s pledge to tack such a hefty tax onto Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other products made in China, saying the president-elect had been misunderstood and the tariff idea amounts to a negotiating tactic.\u00a0 On other topics, Ross appears more in line with with Trump\u2019s campaign positions, such sharing a critical eye about NAFTA, which Ross wrote in an opinion piece had \u201cwound up costing America over 700,000 jobs.\u201d (The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has said some workers lost their jobs as a result of the trade deal, but the \u201cnet employment effects were relatively small.\u201d) Ross wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment, according to his office.\u00a0 Will Ross actually get the Commerce spot? Trump is keeping his administration picks close to the vest. \u201cVery organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, refuting reports that his transition team has grown chaotic. \u201cI am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\u201d\u00a0 Fellow billionaire Carl Icahn said he approved of Ross as a choice for Commerce.\u00a0 \u201cSteve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce. Both would be great choices,\u201d Icahn wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, noting that he had spoken with Trump about the appointments. Mnuchin is thought to be a leading contender for the role of Treasury secretary.\u00a0 Icahn added, \u201cBoth are good friends of mine, but, more importantly, they are two of the smartest people I know.\u201d",

Half of Americans said it\u2019s likely that Mr. Trump will defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington to get rid of corruption. Close to half, 48 percent, said it\u2019s likely that he\u2019ll build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.  Almost half, 49 percent, said they have no real confidence in him handling foreign policy while 27 percent said they have a lot of faith in him. Twenty-three percent said they have some confidence.  Nearly two-thirds said they expect the economy to be in good shape a year from now and about half of Americans believe the country will be better off by 2020. Forty-six percent said they think it will be worse off four years from now and 3 percent predicted it would be about the same.

            "article_content": "BOSTON -- Athletic-gear company New Balance is distancing itself from a white supremacist website\u2019s call to support it for statements a company executive made backing Republican President-elect Donald Trump.  The alt-right website The Daily Stormer proclaimed Boston-based New Balance the \u201cOfficial Shoes of White People\u201d this weekend after company vice president of public affairs Matt LeBretton praised Trump.  LeBretton told the Wall Street Journal that the election of Trump was a move in the \u201cright direction,\u201d a comment that caused some people who don\u2019t like Trump to burn their New Balance sneakers.  New Balance told The Associated Press late Monday it \u201cdoes not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form.\u201d  \u201cAs a 110-year-old company with five factories in the U.S. and thousands of employees worldwide from all races, genders, cultures and sexual orientations, New Balance is a values-driven organization and culture that believes in humanity, integrity, community and mutual respect for people around the world,\u201d it said in a statement.\u00a0 pic.twitter.com/lXtWlCFkIV New Balance has said LeBretton\u2019s comments were taken out of context. It said he was simply referencing Trump\u2019s opposition to a proposed international trade agreement it also has opposed.  \u201cNew Balance has a unique perspective on trade in that we want to make more shoes in the US, not less,\u201d it said in a statement last week.\u00a0 The anger was sparked by a tweet.\u00a0 \u201cThe Obama admin turned a deaf ear to us & frankly w/ Pres-Elect Trump we feel things are going to move in the right direction,\u201d the company had said, according to a tweet by WSJ reporter Sara Germano. Shortly after Germano\u2019s tweet spread, some New Balance sneaker owners who disagreed with the political sentiment tweeted out photos and videos of trashing or even burning their shoes. The sneaker company later clarified to CBS News that the quote in Germano\u2019s tweet was only in reference to one specific issue: President-elect Trump\u2019s stance against the\u00a0Trans-Pacific Partnership\u00a0trade deal. Still, LeBretton\u2019s comment sparked protests: People opposed to Trump, who has promised to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and has appeared on tape boasting about grabbing and kissing women without their consent, posted social media videos of themselves throwing their New Balance shoes in the trash or setting them on fire.\u00a0 @SoleCollector @newbalance pic.twitter.com/6dROPnmYdm @SoleCollector @newbalance good to know. I made a little bonfire tonight :) pic.twitter.com/yOdCTbQgac Many on social media also called for a boycott of the company.\u00a0 Boycott @newbalance shoes. Buy @TOMS or another righteous brand. The CEO of New Balance openly endorsed Donald Trump. .@newbalance Been loyal customer for many years, but never buying your shoes again. Spreading word! #GrabYourWallet https://t.co/HVj9dqnZdw The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin said he believes New Balance\u2019s support of Trump could be a marketing scheme. But he said the website is campaigning to buy the company\u2019s products and is encouraging others to do the same.  He didn\u2019t immediately comment on New Balance\u2019s statement opposing bigotry and hate.",

The object may seem confusing to many in the U.S., but to those who lived in the United Kingdom during Brexit, it\u2019s a sight they\u2019re very much used to. In June, millions voted for the U.K. to leave the European union, and to their surprise, they won -- with 52 percent of the vote. But while some celebrated, others were left shocked and afraid the break would cause a divide. And they had a reason to be concerned.\u00a0 In the aftermath of the\u00a0June 23 vote to leave the European Union, Britain saw a surge in xenophobia expressed in taunts, threats and worse. The hashtag #PostBrexitRacism started trending, as social media users reported verbal harassment on buses, city streets and in cafes. That\u2019s when the safety pin movement began. Today... and until people I know and love can feel safe again #safetypin pic.twitter.com/c7jphNYhQf A Twitter user who helped start the social media campaign said the object would help inspire solidarity and increase safety. The idea being that anyone against the sort of nationalistic, racist violence we've been seeing could identify themselves as a \"safe\" ally. I quite like the idea of just putting a safety pin, empty of anything else, on your coat. A literal SAFETY pin! Months later, Americans are following suit. Some Muslim women in hijabs have reported harassment and intimidation following the presidential election. Police are also investigating the beating of a man in a Chicago neighborhood by a group who yelled that the victim voted for\u00a0Donald Trump,\u00a0CBS Chicago reports.

            "article_content": "BRATISLAVA, Slovakia -- The wave of far-right parties across Europe has been gathering steam from Greece to France, Austria and Germany. While most of the continent\u2019s extreme forces have taken pains to steer clear of Nazi imagery, Slovakia\u2019s answer to the trend celebrates it. Kotleba - The People\u2019s Party Our Slovakia - won almost 10 percent of the seats in Parliament in March. It openly admires the Nazi puppet state which the country was during the World War II. Party members use Nazi salutes, blame Roma for crime in deprived areas, consider NATO a terror group and want the country out of the alliance and the European Union. The party takes its name from its leader, Marian Kotleba, previously chairman of the banned neo-Nazi Slovak Togetherness-National Party, which organized anti-Roma rallies and admired Nazi rule in Slovakia. Thousands have signed a petition demanding that the party be banned. Analysts say the party\u2019s popularity could grow even further. Its simple slogan - \u201cWith courage against the system!\u201d - attracts young people fed up with corruption and the inability of mainstream parties to deal effectively with the post-communist country\u2019s problems. In contrast to most of Europe\u2019s far-right groups, \u201cit\u2019s truly neo-Nazi, it advocates the legacy of the Nazi war state,\u201d says Eduard Chmelar, a Slovak political analyst. Miroslav Mares, an expert on extremism from the Masaryk University in the Czech city of Brno, said the party belongs to the \u201chard core of right-wing extremism\u201d in Europe. He said it has only some features similar to Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn party and to Hungary\u2019s Jobbik at its beginning. What they have in common is targeting the mainstream politics. \u201cThe parties like that are not looking for solutions, it\u2019s all about protests,\u201d Chmelar said. \u201cYou can see it globally. It\u2019s the same with Donald Trump, it\u2019s the same with (Marine) Le Pen in France. What\u2019s important is to be against the system. They\u2019re all riding on a wave of public dissatisfaction that has been growing.\u201d These parties \u201ccommunicate and cooperate with each other, and that dramatically changes the situation in Europe, and that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Chmelar said. \u201cSo far, there\u2019s no recipe to stop them.\u201d Kotleba\u2019s new party made news by launching patrols on trains in April in a reaction to a robbery blamed on a member of the Roma minority. Parliament banned such activities in October. The party has proposed legislation to label non-governmental organizations that receive funding from abroad as foreign agents, and is trying to get the 350,000 signatures needed to force nationwide referendums on the country\u2019s membership in NATO and the European Union. \u201cAmong our major goals is above all a creation of an independent and self-sufficient Slovakia, that is Slovakia which has an autonomous foreign policy that is not dictated by any foreign structure, such as the European Union,\u201d Milan Uhrik, a deputy chairman of the party, told The Associated Press in a rare interview. Kotleba refuses to talk to foreign media, The AP was told. Speaking in the Parliament building, Uhrik said the EU has been turning into a super state with Brussels in power. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst is that EU legislation is above Slovak law,\u201d he said. NATO is another target. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Slovakia to leave NATO because we consider NATO a terrorist organization. It doesn\u2019t bring peace to the world, quite the contrary,\u201d Uhrik said. \u201cNATO is in fact a military organization of the United States and we are militarily subordinated to the United States.\u201d A celebration of wartime Slovakia remains particularly controversial, but Uhrik says it is not about fascism. \u201cAs nationalists, we cannot reject the first independent Slovak state,\u201d he argued. \u201cWe recognize the Slovak (war) state because it was the first Slovak state, not because it was a fascist state.\u201d On Oct. 13, party members celebrated the 129th anniversary of the birth of Jozef Tiso, a Catholic priest and politician who was Slovakia\u2019s war president. During his rule, some 60,000 Slovak Jews were transported to Nazi death camps. He was sentenced to death and hanged in 1947. Rights activists have submitted a petition with 20,000 signatures calling for the party to be banned.\u00a0 Prosecutors are reviewing that request. \u201cRacism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Holocaust denials and other such things have no place in democracy,\u201d said Peter Weisenbacher from Bratislava\u2019s Human Rights Institute. Kotleba is not a newcomer on Slovakia\u2019s political scene. In 2013, he was elected the head of a regional government, campaigning on a strong anti-Roma ticket. He promised to have a recipe to solve problems with the embattled minority, calling its members \u201cGypsy parasites.\u201d He defeated a candidate of the ruling leftist Smer-Social Democracy party in a runoff vote despite that party\u2019s chairman, Prime Minister Robert Fico, claiming that \u201ca bag of potatoes\u201d would beat Kotleba. \u201cIt was a shock for me when (Kotleba) won the regional election,\u201d said Ingrid Kosova, a Roma activist. \u201cI remember people were calling me every day saying that they were ridiculed on the streets, they were not allowed to board buses, they were really afraid. Later on the situation calmed down but until now they live with worries and fears.\u201d In a region hit by unemployment around 15 percent, and over 25 percent in one county, Kosova said Kotleba succeeded in poor areas where the problems with the Roma minority are felt, and \u201cwhich he misused to get to power.\u201d When the party won seats in Parliament, \u201cI was abroad in the Czech Republic and I was considering staying there for good,\u201d Kosova said. During the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising against the Nazi rule in 2014, with foreign presidents and other dignitaries in the central city of Banska Bystrica, the seat of Kotleba\u2019s region, Kotleba was flying a black flag from his office and unveiled banners saying \u201cYankees go home!\u201d and \u201cStop NATO!\u201d The Uprising is considered a defining moment of the Slovak history, and for most Slovaks a source of national pride because they stood against the Nazi rule. Peter Gogola was mayor there at the time. \u201cI can\u2019t forgive him that,\u201d Gogola said. \u201cMy grandpa was forced to fight in the Hungarian fascist army and died at Stalingrad. I can\u2019t stand fascism.\u201d Martin Slosiarik, the head of Bratislava-based pollster Focus, said 70 percent of those who voted for Kotleba are under 40. He said most of them voted for him not because they would share his extremist views but because he promised \u201cto deal with the Roma and get rid of corruption.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve learned how to work with the public opinion to create a picture that they\u2019re the only force ready to challenge the current corrupt system,\u201d Chmelar said. He predicted the party could reach more than 10 percent of the popular vote at the next election.",

            "article_content": "SALT LAKE CITY - Utah Gov. Gary Herbert joined officials across the nation speaking out against reported post-election harassment and bullying in schools. A joint statement issued Friday by Herbert and state Superintendent of Public Instruction Sydnee Dickson says such behavior goes strongly against American principles, and the two state officials urge Utah residents to unite and students to \u201creach out in friendship.\u201d The statement advises parents and school employees to take reports of harassment seriously and to be vigilant in reporting instances of harassment. Utah officials join others nationwide in responding to reports of harassment and bullying in schools, especially of minorities and LGBT students, in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win following a divisive campaign. What began as a series of concerns around reports of harassment in colleges has now spread all the way down America\u2019s educational systems.\u00a0 There have also been reports of the bullying and harassment of minorities after Trump\u2019s victory in society at large, especially of Muslims. In a New York Times Op-Ed on Sunday, Bernie Sanders, the loser of the Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton, said he too has heard of similar reports. \u201cI am deeply distressed to hear stories of Americans being intimidated  and harassed in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, and I hear the cries of  families who are living in fear of being torn apart,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cWe have come too  far as a country in combating discrimination. We are not going back.  Rest assured, there is no compromise on racism, bigotry, xenophobia and  sexism. We will fight it in all its forms, whenever and wherever it  re-emerges.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said Sunday the people generating racist graffiti in the wake of Trump\u2019s election are \u201cnot Republicans\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t want them in our party.\u201d The Wisconsin congressman told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday that, \u201cPeople should really just put their minds at ease. We are pluralistic, we are inclusive... that\u2019s the kind of country we are still going to have.\u201d He said he\u2019s \u201cconfident Donald Trump feels the same way.\u201d Ryan was asked about reports or racist graffiti and hate crimes after Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. Utah Board of Education spokeswoman Emilie Wheeler said it is unclear how many incidents have occurred, but she says it\u2019s enough for administrators to respond on social media and school websites. CBS Salt Lake City affiliate KUTV reports the harassment has been reported on college campuses as well. At Utah Valley University, three copies of a profanity laced flyer attacked what it termed \u201cliberals.\u201d It said those fighting for racial equality should \u201cshut the f*** up\u201d about Muslim rights and gay rights. The Nashville, Tenn., school district said it is providing its counselors with \u201cspecial post-election protocols\u201d to help students in the aftermath of the presidential election. The Tennessean reports that one third-grader sought counseling after a fellow student told him he wouldn\u2019t be able to see one of his two mothers now that Republican Donald Trump has been elected. Metro Nashville Public School announced in a Facebook post and phone message to parents that emotions are running high among students following what many see as \u201cone of the most divisive election seasons in recent history.\u201d The school district said that the \u201csocial and emotional wellbeing of our students impacts their ability to learn and thrive at school,\u201d and reminded families that they can seek counselling \u201cIf you have a child exhibiting anxiety or stress as a result of the election.\u201d Julie Norrell said she found out her son had been bullied at Ruby Major Elementary School through a message from his teacher. \u201cThere has been a lot of ugliness and bullying to come out of this election and I think children pick up on that from TV or their parents,\u201d Norrell said. \u201cThe man that won the election has been modeling that it\u2019s OK to bully people, it\u2019s OK to call people names, it\u2019s OK to be mean. And now, children think it\u2019s OK to be mean too because the president is doing it.\u201d In Pennsylvania, parents received reports of students in one high school celebrating Trump\u2019s victory by yelling \u201cwhite power!\u201d PBS reports middle school students in Michigan were heard shouting \u201cbuild that wall!\u201d during their lunch period. Civility in politics has been declining for years, both a cause and symptom of a changing culture where anonymous verbal assaults are fired freely across the internet, and cable TV routinely broadcasts words once banned from the airwaves. But Donald Trump\u2019s presidential run took name-calling and mockery - things that voters long said they detested in their candidates - and normalized them into a winning political strategy. Now Trump, the president-elect, is calling for unity in words that draw attention precisely because they sound so unlike Trump, the candidate. But many question whether it is possible to reverse the campaign\u2019s damage to political discourse and its ripples out to the way Americans speak to and about each other. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of blame to go around on this subject, but I think in this particular election that an embrace of Donald Trump was an embrace of incivility and vulgarity and insults and bullying, and unfortunately we saw very little public repudiation of that from any Trump supporters,\u201d said Mark DeMoss, an Atlanta public relations executive and conservative Republican whose clients are mostly Christian religious organizations. DeMoss, who abandoned a campaign called the Civility Project in early 2011 after only three members of Congress would sign a pledge to act respectfully, watched the degradation of political speech for years. Then Trump\u2019s campaign, he and other longtime observers say, stomped well past what was thought to be acceptable. \u201cWe can all point to incidents in campaigns across history, but I think this one probably does represent a new place in terms of incivility,\u201d said James Mullen, president of Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, which awards a prize each year for civility in public life. \u201cWhat worries me the most is we\u2019re becoming almost numb,\u201d Mullen said. When Allegheny - which first polled Americans about political civility in 2010 - did so again in October, researchers noted a \u201cdisturbing\u201d decline in those rejecting insults in politics. The number who disapprove of political comments about someone\u2019s race or ethnicity declined from 89 percent to 69 percent. The number who said it was unacceptable to shout over a debate opponent fell from 86 percent to 65 percent. Many observers blame Trump, who called Mexican immigrants \u201crapists,\u201d tarred his adversaries as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d and \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and complained that a TV journalist\u2019s dogged questioning was just a sign she had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever.\u201d He said all of those things, not on long-forgotten tapes, but in front of millions of voters. At Trump\u2019s rallies, supporters followed suit, chanting \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d about Clinton and wearing T-shirts with the slogan, \u201cTrump That Bitch!\u201d Nearly 2,000 teachers surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center this spring reported that the campaign\u2019s scorching words were having a \u201cprofoundly negative impact\u201d on their students. More than half said they had seen an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose race, religion or nationality had been targeted by political rhetoric. The survey did not identify any candidates. But teachers singled out Trump in more than 1,000 comments, while fewer than 200 combined named Clinton, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. In recent years, teachers mindful of bullying and taunts on social media have worked to make schools places of mutual respect, said Maureen Costello, director of the SPLC\u2019s Teaching Tolerance project. \u201cWhat made this year really different is that it broke through that protective moat,\u201d Costello said. The political rhetoric was \u201cso ubiquitous and so saturated the culture that you couldn\u2019t keep it out of schools. Kids are sponges.\u201d When Beth Ferris, a middle school teacher in Yucca Valley, California, told students on Election Day that history would be made one way or the other, one of her students said, \u201cYeah, she (Clinton) should be in jail!\u201d At a nearby high school, vandals painted \u201cTrump 2016,\u201d on a wall and covered the word \u201cGirls\u201d on a bathroom door with a vulgarity. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d Ferris said. On the day after the election, teacher Dee Burek said fifth and sixth graders in her Allentown, New Jersey, middle school asked how Trump had become the Republican nominee. She recalled his insults of opponents in debates and how they stuck. \u201cThe kids just kind of looked at me and said, \u2018But that doesn\u2019t make any sense. That\u2019s bullying,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf these middle schoolers can see that, I think there\u2019s hope.\u201d",

The \u201cGirls\u201d star recalls saying, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to go this way\u201d when Donald Trump clinched the presidency, she wrote in an essay for her Lenny website published Friday. The essay marked her first public statement -- aside from a tweet honoring the late Leonard Cohen -- Dunham made since Election Day. \u201cAs horrifying as I found Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, as hideous as I found his racism and xenophobia, as threatening to basic decency as I found his demagogue persona, I never truly believed he could win,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0 But win he did, something that became clearer and clearer on Tuesday night. \u201cThe three hours I spent at the Javits Center Tuesday night, surrounded by campaign staffers and fellow surrogates for Hillary Clinton, are blurred and spotty,\u201d Dunham recalled. \u201cAt a certain point it became clear something had gone horribly wrong.\u201d Dunham also looked back on the vitriol and abuse she and other Clinton supporters withstood over the course of her time working for the campaign. \u201cI received threats and abuse at a level I could not have imagined,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy Twitter mentions went from rude to downright violent. My phone was hacked, and I was sent images of aborted fetuses, weapons. I was called a fat whore, a retard, told I should be killed in front of everyone who knew me.\u201d \u201cMy experience mimics that of so many women who organized for Hillary Clinton and against Donald Trump, most of them not celebrities. We wanted a female president. We wanted guaranteed control over our own bodies. We wanted equal pay. That made us nasty. That made us targets.\u201d Dunham ended her essay calling for action, for those who opposed Trump to fight back.\u00a0 \u201cIn this new reality, we have all been radicalized. It\u2019s no longer a word for those living on the fringes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a word for everyone who walks in pain with the results of this election, who feels their identity being crushed under the weight of the half of the country who voted for a man who denounces and denies the basic rights of women, the queer community, immigrants, Muslims, people of color and the differently abled.\u201d She also offered a message of hope: \u201cWe will not be governed by fear. We will show our children a different way. We will go home like shooting stars.\u201d Ned Ehrbar is an entertainment producer for CBS News.",

Bernie Sanders said Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump won the election fair and square\u2014and that Democrats must now focus on holding him \u201caccountable.\u201d \u201cHe won the election,\u201d Sanders told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cI did everything I could to see that he not become elected, but he won. Our job now is to hold him accountable.\u201d The Vermont senator and former 2016 hopeful said there\u2019s some common ground to be had with Trump, who tapped into the anger and frustration among the white working class in the United States. Sanders, too, struck a chord with many voters this year with his criticism of the country\u2019s elite. \u201cIf Mr. Trump in fact has the courage to take on Wall Street, to take on the drug companies, to try to go forward to create a better life for working people we will work with him on issue by issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if his presidency is going to be about discrimination, if it\u2019s going to be about scapegoating immigrants or scapegoating African Americans or Muslims, we will oppose him vigorously.\u201d The next question for Democrats, Sanders said, is to try to understand why their message is losing at the ballot box not just for the White House, but for state and local offices around the country -- and said the \u201cliberal elite\u201d and their focus on high-dollar fundraising plays a role. \u201cHow does it happen that they win elections and Democrats lose?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd I think what the conclusion is Democrats have focused too much with a liberal elite which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people in the upper middle class but has ignored to a very significant degree the working class and the middle class and low-income people in this country.\u201d Trump himself, Sanders added, is part of the reason Democrats lost: he has \u201cvery, very good political instincts.\u201d \u201cWhat he understood, which many Democrats did not, which is if you are an average American out there making $30, 40, 50 thousand dollars a year \u2026 \u00a0you know what, John, you\u2019re pissed off, you\u2019re not happy about it, you\u2019re seeing your jobs to go to China,\u201d Sanders said. Asked who was now the de facto head of the Democratic Party, Sanders replied: \u201cI\u2019m not into leaders.\u201d He has backed Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota) as the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee -- a position that will ultimately say a lot about the future direction of the party. \u201cI am into building a movement which transforms this country and brings people together around an agenda that works for the middle class and working families,\u201d he said. Sanders\u2019 question for Trump now, he said, is whether he will actually do something to make good on his promises to help the country\u2019s frustrated working class.  \u201cYou talked about being the champion of the working families -- all right now produce. Your rhetoric was great, now do something,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will not accept racism, we will not accept sexism or xenophobia.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "PORTLAND, Ore. -- As protests of President-elect Donald Trump entered another day, police in Portland, Oregon, say one person was shot and injured by a man who had gotten into a confrontation with a protester and then opened fire. Portland police said the victim was taken to a hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries and they were looking for a male suspect, who got out of a vehicle and fired multiple shots early Saturday morning on a Willamette River bridge before fleeing in the vehicle. The shooting followed rowdy Friday night protests, when police used tear gas in response to \u201cburning projectiles\u201d thrown at officers, police said on Twitter. Hundreds of people marched through the city, disrupting traffic and spray-painting graffiti. Authorities reported instances of vandalism and assault during a rally that organizers had billed as peaceful earlier in the day. Anger over the election has had some violent and ugly results, CBS News correspondent Marlie Hall reports. A video posted to social media shows David Wilcox, a white Trump supporter, being beaten by a group of African-Americans following a traffic dispute in Chicago. \u201cSomebody yelled, \u2018That\u2019s one of them white boy Trump supporters,\u2019 and then I said, \u2018What does that have to do with this? We\u2019re talking about insurance here,\u2019\u201d Wilcox told CBS station WBBM-TV. \u201cAnd I asked the lady, \u2018Ma\u2019am, do you have insurance?\u2019 and immediately punches were thrown. They didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d But the coarseness goes both ways. Chants of \u201cwhite power\u201d were heard from students holding a Trump-Pence campaign sign at a school in York, Pennsylvania. And middle schoolers in Michigan chanted \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d leaving Latino students in tears. Reaction from the school district was swift. \u201cThis is not who we are,\u201d said Principal Todd Noonan. \u201cEveryone is welcome in our community of learners. We build bridges. We work together.\u201d In other parts of the country, spirited demonstrations on college campuses and peaceful marches along downtown streets have taken place since Wednesday. Hundreds joined a Friday afternoon \u201clove rally\u201d in Washington Square Park in Manhattan. Leslie Holmes, 65, a website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, took an hour-long train ride to the demonstration - her first protest since the 1970s, when she hit the streets of San Francisco to oppose the Vietnam War. She described herself as an armchair liberal but declared, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be armchair anymore.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a country where my friends aren\u2019t included, and my friends are fearful, and my children are going to grow up in a world that\u2019s frightening, and my granddaughters can look forward to being excluded from jobs and politics and fulfilling their potential, so I\u2019m here for them,\u201d she said. Evening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta. Trump supporter Nicolas Quirico was traveling from South Beach to Miami. His car was among hundreds stopped when protesters blocked Interstate 395. \u201cTrump will be our president. There is no way around that, and the sooner people grasp that, the better off we will be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a difference between a peaceful protest and standing in a major highway backing up traffic for 5 miles. This is wrong.\u201d More than a thousand protesters took to the streets across California after night fell including downtown Los Angeles, where over 200 were arrested a night earlier. In Bakersfield, where Trump is far more popular than in most of the state, some held signs reading \u201cAnti-Trump, Pro-USA.\u201d Small protests also were held in Detroit; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Olympia, Washington and Iowa City. More than 200 people carrying signs gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted \u201cnot my president\u201d and \u201cno Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\u201d In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. A protest also occurred in Minneapolis. In Chicago, multiple groups planned protests through Saturday. Nadia Gavino, 25, learned about the rallies on Twitter and protested Thursday evening. Gavino, whose father is from Peru and whose mother is of Mexican and Lithuanian heritage, said she took Trump\u2019s harshest statements about immigrants and Latinos personally. \u201cI obviously agree that he\u2019s racist, he\u2019s sexist, he\u2019s phobic, he\u2019s misogynistic. He\u2019s all these things you don\u2019t want in a leader,\u201d she said. Ashley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver. \u201cI have a leader I fear for the first time in my life,\u201d said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re sore losers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation.\u201d Demonstrations also were planned Saturday in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other areas. Previous demonstrations drew thousands of people in New York and other large urban centers. The largely peaceful demonstrations were overshadowed by sporadic episodes of vandalism, violence and street-blocking.",

It is an adjective defined as \u201crelating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\u201d It won the honorific because use of the term rose 2,000 percent between this year and last, and it applied to more than just the race for the White House. Video: learn more about our Word of the Year and shortlist from dictionaries editor Jonathan Dent: https://t.co/yl588Txkrg In Britain, the campaign to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, was marked by numerous factual evasions and missteps. Yet the side that appeared to use truth more loosely won, much like Mr. Trump. The Oxford Dictionaries says the word is used an adjective, and is mostly associated with \u201cpost-truth politics.\u201d \u201cPost-truth has gone from being a peripheral term to being a mainstay in political commentary, now often being used by major publications without the need for clarification or definition in their headlines,\u201d the company said in a statement. The term post-truth calls to mind 2006\u2019s word of the year for some dictionaries: \u201ctruthiness.\u201d Stephen Colbert is popularly credited with coining that term, deploying it repeatedly when talking about the Bush administration\u2019s military operation in Iraq.\u00a0 However, Katherine Connor Martin, the head of United States dictionaries at Oxford University Press, told the New York Times: \u201cTruthiness is a humorous way of discussing a quality of specific  claims. Post-truth is an adjective that is describing a much  bigger thing. It\u2019s saying that the truth is being regarded as mostly  irrelevant.\u201d Both \u201ctruthiness\u201d and \u201cpost-truth\u201d weren\u2019t invented to describe the political climate in which they were frequently invoked. Linguists have found older uses of both words, and instead attribute their recent rise in popularity to people looking for accurate descriptions of their apparent political consternation. The election of Donald Trump has also given rise to other curiosities and discoveries in the English language. Merriam-Webster reports that the most searched-for words following Mr. Trump\u2019s victory were, in order: fascism, bigot, xenophobe, racism, socialism, resurgence, xenophobia, and misogyny. All of those ideas were central talking points in the rhetoric of both presidential campaigns, whether as accusations or denials. Runners-up for the 2016 word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries include \u201cBrexiteer,\u201d which is an advocate of the U.K. leaving the EU; \u201calt-right,\u201d which is an extreme, conservative, mostly online political movement; \u201cadulting,\u201d which is the practice of behaving in a way characteristic of a responsible adult; and \u201cwoke,\u201d an adjective in America used informally to describe a person\u2019s awareness towards injustice in society, especially racism. The seriousness of the words defining 2016 stand a far cry from 2015, when Oxford Dictionaries chose a smiling, crying emoji as its word of the year.

            "article_content": "There were protests in both major and smaller cities throughout the U.S. on Friday, for the third consecutive night after President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory.\u00a0 As the fourth night of protests over the election of Donald Trump roiled the city of Portland, marchers and anarchists blocked streets, forced freeways to close and interrupted bridge traffic. Around 8:40 p.m., ODOT closed the northbound I-5 at the Marquam Bridge, the southbound I-5 at the Fremont Bridge and I-84 at the I-5 junction. Later, police tweeted they were working with ODOT and officials at the Moda Center to help with traffic leaving the Blazers game. Thousands of protesters were seen in various spots throughout the city, as the protest grew from a small but peaceful gathering at City Hall that began around 5 p.m. Police repeatedly used a bullhorn to tell the protesters they were \u201cparticipating in an unlawful protest,\u201d and had been seen committing \u201cvandalism and assault.\u201d If they didn\u2019t move, the police said, the protesters were \u201csubject to use of force\u201d and \u201carrest and prosecution. Move now!\u201d Instead, the protesters stayed and took cell-phone videos. Despite the police orders, the protesters moved onto SW 3rd and walked against traffic, creating chaos, traffic delays and confusion. Police blocked them from getting on the Burnside Bridge as they headed toward Old Town. Hundreds of people took to the streets in Atlanta Friday night to protest President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory, CBS affiliate WGCL reports.\u00a0 Police officers have allowed the protesters to march, simply following behind to make sure they remain peaceful. Protesters tried to get on the interstate, but authorities have prevented that from happening. Protesters could be heard shouting a lot of anti-Donald Trump messages, including, \u201cNot My President.\u201d Evening marches disrupted traffic in Miami while organizers said people gathered on Boston Common in what was billed as a rally for peace and love.\u00a0 Earlier, hundreds of people attended another \u201clove rally\u201d in Washington Square Park in Manhattan.  Leslie Holmes, 65, a website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, took an hour-long train ride to the demonstration - her first protest since the 1970s, when she hit the streets of San Francisco to oppose the Vietnam War.  She described herself as an armchair liberal but declared, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be armchair anymore.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a country where my friends aren\u2019t included, and my friends are fearful, and my children are going to grow up in a world that\u2019s frightening, and my granddaughters can look forward to being excluded from jobs and politics and fulfilling their potential, so I\u2019m here for them,\u201d she said.  More than 200 people, carrying signs gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted \u201cnot my president\u201d and \u201cno Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\u201d  In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. A protest also occurred in Minneapolis.\u00a0 More than 100 protesters in Kansas City, Missouri, are decrying president-elect Donald Trump.  As temperatures dipped into the 40s, the demonstrators gathered Friday night outside Kansas City\u2019s landmark Union Station and planned to march to City Hall in the latest protest over Republican mogul\u2019s victory.  Clutching a placard reading \u201cNot My President,\u201d 67-year-old Kansas high school teacher David Young says he objects to what he perceived to be Trump\u2019s intolerance toward Hispanics and other demographic groups during his campaign.  Young, a French and Spanish instructor from Shawnee, Kansas, says \u201cTrump\u2019s message of hate has to be stopped,\u201d and \u201cit goes against everything we\u2019re trying to teach.\u201d  Previous demonstrations since Tuesday\u2019s election drew thousands in New York, Los Angeles and other large urban centers. Some involved sporadic vandalism, violence and street-blocking.\u00a0 In Chicago, multiple groups planned protests through Saturday.  Nadia Gavino, 25, learned about the rallies on Twitter and protested Thursday evening. Gavino, whose father is from Peru and whose mother is of Mexican and Lithuanian heritage, said she took Trump\u2019s harshest statements about immigrants and Latinos personally.  \u201cI obviously agree that he\u2019s racist, he\u2019s sexist, he\u2019s phobic, he\u2019s misogynistic. He\u2019s all these things you don\u2019t want in a leader,\u201d she said.  Ashley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver.  \u201cI have a leader I fear for the first time in my life,\u201d said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Hillary Clinton.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re sore losers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation.\u201d  Demonstrations also were planned Saturday in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other areas.  Protesters gathered at Miami\u2019s Bayfront Park Friday night in a demonstration, CBS Miami reports.\u00a0 Several hundred people showed up with signs, voicing their disagreement over Trump\u2019s stunning victory. Police followed along, making sure to keep the peace and prevent drivers on the road from clashing with the crowd. The protest marked dozens of others across the country, including students at the University of Miami who also gathered to hold a demonstration earlier in the day. Video from Chopper 4 showed a largely peaceful protest. Students told CBS Miami they felt their message was more effectively delivered by being peaceful. \u201cI definitely think this is the approach to go,\u201d said Miguel Hernandez. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to fight fire with fire, hate with hate, so the approach we\u2019re taking is fighting hate with love and I think that\u2019s the best thing to do just to show that everyone is accepted and just to show that love can really go a long way, a very far way.\u201d Miami\u2019s protest is expected to last until 10 p.m., according to a post on social media. A group of about 250 students from Minneapolis\u2019 South High School peacefully made their way from South High School to downtown Friday afternoon. They ultimately gathered in a park near U.S. Bank Stadium at around 3:30 p.m., CBS Minnesota reports. About a half an hour later, the group started marching south on Portland Avenue. After heading west on 9th Street, protesters turned to Nicollet Mall where they entered the U.S. Bankcorp Center. The group continued marching downtown and headed into the U.S. Bank Plaza, across from the Hennepin County Government Center. Upset protesters were met with police in cities across the country. Officers in Portland, Oregon confronted thousands of protesters in what police called a \u201criot\u201d and arrested more than two dozen people. Police in riot gear fired rubber bullets to try and break up the crowd. They declared it a riot after people began vandalizing cars and businesses. Some protesters launched fireworks at the police. On Thursday, police in Portland officially declared the protests as \u201criots,\u201d citing \u201cextensive criminal and dangerous behavior.\u201d CBS affiliate KOIN estimated there were around 4,000 protesters Thursday.\u00a0 In New York on Wednesday, an estimated 7,000 people protested in front of Trump\u2019s home at Trump Tower.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s not often that the political and fashion worlds collide, but one designer brought the two industries into the same realm on Thursday afternoon. French designer Sophie Theallet, who has dressed First Lady Michelle Obama, tweeted an open letter explaining why she\u2019ll stay away from Melania Trump once she moves into the White House. \u201cAs an independent fashion brand, we consider our voice an expression of our artistic and philosophical ideas. The Sophie Theallet brand stands against all discrimination and prejudice,\u201d the letter says. Open letter | Sophie Theallet | November 17th, 2016 pic.twitter.com/g1hIAyBmdF Theallet, an immigrant, admits she is \u201cwell aware it is not wise to get involved in politics,\u201d but that the bottom line of her business is \u201cnot just about money\u201d and she must stand by her values. Those values, she writes, do not align with \u201cthe rhetoric of racism, sexism, and xenophobia unleashed by [Donald Trump\u2019s] presidential campaign.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI   will not participate in dressing or associating in any way with the next first lady,\u201d Theallet says. \u201cI encourage my fellow designers to do the same.\u201d Designing for the first lady is a high honor in the fashion world, making Theallet\u2019s appeal to her colleagues even more daring. But she is not the first designer to take a stand against the Trumps. Kaelen Haworth, known for her creations for Blake Lively and Elizabeth Banks, announced after the election that proceeds from items sold on her website would be donated to organizations opposed by Trump. The list includes Planned Parenthood, Black Lives Matter, and Everytown for Gun Safety. But not everyone is jumping off of the Trump Train, and those who have might buy another ticket soon, says fashion legend Carolina Herrera. \u201cI think that in two or three months they\u2019ll reach out, because it\u2019s fashion. You\u2019ll see everyone dressing Melania. She\u2019s representing the United States,\u201d Herrera told Business of Fashion. Cydney Adams is a senior manager of social media for CBS News.
